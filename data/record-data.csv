"CD163 expression defines specific, IRF8-dependent, immune-modulatory macrophages in the bone marrow.","BACKGROUND: Scavenger receptor CD163 is exclusively expressed on monocytes/macrophages and is widely used as a marker for alternatively activated macrophages. However, the role of CD163 is not yet clear.OBJECTIVES: We examined the function of CD163 in steady-state as well as in sterile and infectious inflammation.CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms are not necessarily associated with a decreased antimicrobial activity. In contrast, our data define a novel macrophage population which controls overwhelming inflammation on one hand but is also necessary for an effective control of infections on the other hand.","The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology","32199911",2020,"United States"
"Bacterial phenotypic heterogeneity in DNA repair and mutagenesis.","Genetically identical cells frequently exhibit striking heterogeneity in various phenotypic traits such as their morphology, growth rate, or gene expression. Such non-genetic diversity can help clonal bacterial populations overcome transient environmental challenges without compromising genome stability, while genetic change is required for long-term heritable adaptation. At the heart of the balance between genome stability and plasticity are the DNA repair pathways that shield DNA from lesions and reverse errors arising from the imperfect DNA replication machinery. In principle, phenotypic heterogeneity in the expression and activity of DNA repair pathways can modulate mutation rates in single cells and thus be a source of heritable genetic diversity, effectively reversing the genotype-to-phenotype dogma. Long-standing evidence for mutation rate heterogeneity comes from genetics experiments on cell populations, which are now complemented by direct measurements on individual living cells. These measurements are increasingly performed using fluorescence microscopy with a temporal and spatial resolution that enables localising, tracking, and counting proteins with single-molecule sensitivity. In this review, we discuss which molecular processes lead to phenotypic heterogeneity in DNA repair and consider the potential consequences on genome stability and dynamics in bacteria. We further inspect these concepts in the context of DNA damage and mutation induced by antibiotics.","Biochemical Society transactions","32196548",2020,"England"
"Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis on the receptor ACE2 expression reveals the potential risk of different human organs vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection.","It has been known that, the novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which is considered similar to SARS-CoV and originated from Wuhan (China), invades human cells via the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Moreover, lung cells that have ACE2 expression may be the main target cells during 2019-nCoV infection. However, some patients also exhibit non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs. To construct a risk map of different human organs, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems. Through scRNA-seq data analyses, we identified the organs at risk, such as lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum, and located specific cell types (i.e., type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells), which are vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-nCoV infection. This study may provide potential clues for further investigation of the pathogenesis and route of 2019-nCoV infection.","Frontiers of medicine","32170560",2020,"China"
"Single-cell gene profiling and lineage tracing analyses revealed novel mechanisms of endothelial repair by progenitors.","Stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) have been implicated to participate in vascular repair. However, the exact role of SPCs in endothelial repair of large vessels still remains controversial. This study aimed to delineate the cellular heterogeneity and possible functional role of endogenous vascular SPCs in large vessels. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and genetic lineage tracing mouse models, we uncovered the cellular heterogeneity of SPCs, i.e., c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells in the mouse aorta, and found that endogenous c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells acquire endothelial cell fate in the aorta under both physiological and pathological conditions. While c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to aortic endothelial turnover in the atheroprone regions during homeostasis, recipient c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells of nonbone marrow source replace both luminal and microvessel endothelial cells in transplant arteriosclerosis. Single-cell pseudotime analysis of scRNA-seq data and in vitro cell experiments suggest that vascular SPCs display endothelial differentiation potential and undergo metabolic reprogramming during cell differentiation, in which AKT/mTOR-dependent glycolysis is critical for endothelial gene expression. These findings demonstrate a critical role for c-Kit lineage cells in aortic endothelial turnover and replacement, and may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for vascular diseases.","Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","32166394",2020,"United Kingdom"
"Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockade in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy<U+00A0>Cardiomyopathy.","BACKGROUND: Although cardiomyopathy has emerged as a leading cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), limited studies and therapies have emerged for dystrophic heart failure.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to model DMD cardiomyopathy using DMD patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and to identify physiological changes and future drug therapies.METHODS: To explore and define therapies for DMD cardiomyopathy, the authors used DMD patient-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to examine the physiological response to adrenergic agonists and ¦Â-blocker treatment. The authors further examined these agents in<U+00A0>vivo using wild-type and mdx mouse models.RESULTS: At baseline and following adrenergic stimulation, DMD hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes had a significant increase in arrhythmic calcium traces compared to isogenic controls. Furthermore, these arrhythmias were significantly decreased with propranolol treatment. Using telemetry monitoring, the authors observed that mdx mice, which lack dystrophin, had an arrhythmic death when stimulated with isoproterenol; the lethal arrhythmias were rescued, in part, by propranolol pre-treatment. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the authors compared DMD and control hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, mdx mice, and control mice (in the presence or absence of propranolol and isoproterenol) and defined pathways that were perturbed under baseline conditions and pathways that were normalized after propranolol treatment in the mdx model. The authors also undertook transcriptome analysis of human DMD left ventricle samples and found that DMD hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes have dysregulated pathways similar to the human DMD heart. The authors further determined that relatively few patients with DMD see a cardiovascular specialist or receive ¦Â-blocker therapy.CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight mechanisms and therapeutic interventions from human to animal and back to human in the dystrophic heart. These results may serve as a prelude for an adequately powered clinical study that examines the impact of ¦Â-blocker therapy in patients with dystrophinopathies.","Journal of the American College of Cardiology","32164890",2020,"United States"

"ERS International Congress, Madrid, 2019: highlights from the Basic and Translational Science Assembly.","In this review, the Basic and Translational Sciences Assembly of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) provides an overview of the 2019 ERS International Congress highlights. In particular, we discuss how the novel and very promising technology of single cell sequencing has led to the development of a comprehensive map of the human lung, the lung cell atlas, including the discovery of novel cell types and new insights into cellular trajectories in lung health and disease. Further, we summarise recent insights in the field of respiratory infections, which can aid in a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these infections in order to develop novel vaccines and improved treatment options. Novel concepts delineating the early origins of lung disease are focused on the effects of pre- and post-natal exposures on neonatal lung development and long-term lung health. Moreover, we discuss how these early life exposures can affect the lung microbiome and respiratory infections. In addition, the importance of metabolomics and mitochondrial function analysis to subphenotype chronic lung disease patients according to their metabolic program is described. Finally, basic and translational respiratory science is rapidly moving forward and this will be beneficial for an advanced molecular understanding of the mechanisms underlying a variety of lung diseases. In the long-term this will aid in the development of novel therapeutic targeting strategies in the field of respiratory medicine.","ERJ open research","32154289",2020,"England"
"Clonal tracking using embedded viral barcoding and high-throughput sequencing.","Embedded viral barcoding in combination with high-throughput sequencing is a powerful technology with which to track single-cell clones. It can provide clonal-level insights into cellular proliferation, development, differentiation, migration, and treatment efficacy. Here, we present a detailed protocol for a viral barcoding procedure that includes the creation of barcode libraries, the viral delivery of barcodes, the recovery of barcodes, and the computational analysis of barcode sequencing data. The entire procedure can be completed within a few weeks. This barcoding method requires cells to be susceptible to viral transduction. It provides high sensitivity and throughput, and enables precise quantification of cellular progeny. It is cost efficient and does not require any advanced skills. It can also be easily adapted to many types of applications, including both in vitro and in vivo experiments.","Nature protocols","32132718",2020,"England"
"Dynamic Interstitial Cell Response during Myocardial Infarction Predicts Resilience to Rupture in Genetically Diverse Mice.","Cardiac ischemia leads to the loss of myocardial tissue and the activation of a repair process that culminates in the formation of a scar whose structural characteristics dictate propensity to favorable healing or detrimental cardiac wall rupture. To elucidate the cellular processes underlying scar formation, here we perform unbiased single-cell mRNA sequencing of interstitial cells isolated from infarcted mouse hearts carrying a genetic tracer that labels epicardial-derived cells. Sixteen interstitial cell clusters are revealed, five of which were of epicardial origin. Focusing on stromal cells, we define 11 sub-clusters, including diverse cell states of epicardial- and endocardial-derived fibroblasts. Comparing transcript profiles from post-infarction hearts in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice, which displays a marked divergence in the frequency of cardiac rupture, uncovers an early increase in activated myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen deposition, and persistent acute phase response in 129S1/SvImJ mouse hearts, defining a crucial time window of pathological remodeling that predicts disease outcome.","Cell reports","32130914",2020,"United States"
"Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies ZIC2 as an essential gene that controls the cell fate of early mesodermal precursors to human heart progenitors.","Cardiac progenitor formation is one of the earliest committed steps of human cardiogenesis and requires the cooperation of multiple gene sets governed by developmental signaling cascades. To determine the key regulators for cardiac progenitor formation, we have developed a two-stage genome-wide CRISPR-knockout screen. We mimicked the progenitor formation process by differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes, monitored by two distinct stage markers of early cardiac mesodermal formation and commitment to a multipotent heart progenitor cell fate: MESP1 and ISL1, respectively. From the screen output, we compiled a list of 15 candidate genes. After validating seven of them, we identified ZIC2 as an essential gene for cardiac progenitor formation. ZIC2 is known as a master regulator of neurogenesis. hPSCs with ZIC2 mutated still express pluripotency markers. However, their ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes was greatly attenuated. RNA-Seq profiling of the ZIC2-mutant cells revealed that the mutants switched their cell fate alternatively to the noncardiac cell lineage. Further, single cell RNA-seq analysis showed the ZIC2 mutants affected the apelin receptor-related signaling pathway during mesoderm formation. Our results provide a new link between ZIC2 and human cardiogenesis and document the potential power of a genome-wide unbiased CRISPR-knockout screen to identify the key steps in human mesoderm precursor cell- and heart progenitor cell-fate determination during in vitro hPSC cardiogenesis.","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","32129551",2020,"United States"
"TooManyCells identifies and visualizes relationships of single-cell clades.","Identifying and visualizing transcriptionally similar cells is instrumental for accurate exploration of the cellular diversity revealed by single-cell transcriptomics. However, widely used clustering and visualization algorithms produce a fixed number of cell clusters. A fixed clustering 'resolution' hampers our ability to identify and visualize echelons of cell states. We developed TooManyCells, a suite of graph-based algorithms for efficient and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades. TooManyCells introduces a visualization model built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to dimensionality-reduction methods. TooManyCells is also equipped with an efficient matrix-free divisive hierarchical spectral clustering different from prevalent single-resolution clustering methods. TooManyCells enables multiresolution and multifaceted exploration of single-cell clades. An advantage of this paradigm is the immediate detection of rare and common populations that outperforms popular clustering and visualization algorithms, as demonstrated using existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets and new data modeling drug-resistance acquisition in leukemic T cells.","Nature methods","32123397",2020,"United States"
"Long-term, in toto live imaging of cardiomyocyte behaviour during mouse ventricle chamber formation at single-cell resolution.","Mapping of the holistic cell behaviours sculpting the four-chambered mammalian heart has been a goal or previous studies, but so far only success in transparent invertebrates and lower vertebrates with two-chambered hearts has been achieved. Using a live-imaging system comprising a customized vertical light-sheet microscope equipped with a mouse embryo culture module, a heartbeat-gated imaging strategy and a digital image processing framework, we realized volumetric imaging of developing mouse hearts at single-cell resolution and with uninterrupted cell lineages for up to 1.5<U+2009>d. Four-dimensional landscapes of Nppa<sup>+</sup> cardiomyocyte cell behaviours revealed a blueprint for ventricle chamber formation by which biased outward migration of the outermost cardiomyocytes is coupled with cell intercalation and horizontal division. The inner-muscle architecture of trabeculae was developed through dual mechanisms: early fate segregation and transmural cell arrangement involving both oriented cell division and directional migration. Thus, live-imaging reconstruction of uninterrupted cell lineages affords a transformative means for deciphering mammalian organogenesis.","Nature cell biology","32123336",2020,"England"
"Single cell determination of cardiac microtissue structure and function using light sheet microscopy.","Native cardiac tissue is comprised of heterogeneous cell populations that work cooperatively for proper tissue function; thus, engineered tissue models have moved toward incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in an effort to recapitulate native multicellular composition and organization. Cardiac tissue models comprised of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes require inclusion of non-myocytes to promote stable tissue formation, yet the specific contributions of the supporting non-myocyte population on the parenchymal cardiomyocytes and cardiac microtissues have yet to be fully dissected. This gap can be partly attributed to limitations in technologies able to accurately study the individual cellular structure and function that comprise intact 3D tissues. The ability to interrogate the cell-cell interactions in 3D tissue constructs has been restricted by conventional optical imaging techniques that fail to adequately penetrate multicellular microtissues with sufficient spatial resolution. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy overcomes these constraints to enable single cell-resolution structural and functional imaging of intact cardiac microtissues. Multicellular spatial distribution analysis of heterotypic cardiac cell populations revealed that cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were randomly distributed throughout 3D microtissues. Furthermore, calcium imaging of live cardiac microtissues enabled single-cell detection of cardiomyocyte calcium activity, which showed that functional heterogeneity correlated with spatial location within the tissues. This study demonstrates that light sheet fluorescence microscopy can be utilized to determine single-cell spatial and functional interactions of multiple cell types within intact 3D engineered microtissues, thereby facilitating the determination of structure-function relationships at both tissue-level and single-cell resolution.","Tissue engineering.

"Epigenetic-sensitive pathways in personalized therapy of major cardiovascular diseases.","The complex pathobiology underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has yet to be explained. Aberrant epigenetic changes may result from alterations in enzymatic activities, which are responsible for putting in and/or out the covalent groups, altering the epigenome and then modulating gene expression. The identification of novel individual epigenetic-sensitive trajectories at single cell level might provide additional opportunities to establish predictive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as drug targets in CVDs. To date, most of studies investigated DNA methylation mechanism and miRNA regulation as epigenetics marks. During atherogenesis, big epigenetic changes in DNA methylation and different ncRNAs, such as miR-93, miR-340, miR-433, miR-765, CHROME, were identified into endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages. During man development, lipid metabolism, inflammation and homocysteine homeostasis, alter vascular transcriptional mechanism of fundamental genes such as ABCA1, SREBP2, NOS, HIF1. At histone level, increased HDAC9 was associated with matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and MMP2 expression in pro-inflammatory macrophages of human carotid plaque other than to have a positive effect on toll like receptor signaling and innate immunity. HDAC9 deficiency promoted inflammation resolution and reverse cholesterol transport, which might block atherosclerosis progression and promote lesion regression. Here, we describe main human epigenetic mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease; cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Different epigenetics mechanisms are activated, such as regulation by circular RNAs, as MICRA, and epitranscriptomics at RNA level. Moreover, in order to open new frontiers for precision medicine and personalized therapy, we offer a panoramic view on the most innovative bioinformatic tools designed to identify putative genes and molecular networks underlying CVDs in man.","Pharmacology &amp; therapeutics","32105674",2020,"England"

"In silico investigation of the mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation due to impaired Pitx2.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is a major cause of stroke and morbidity. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (Pitx2) to be strongly associated with AF. However, the mechanisms underlying Pitx2 modulated arrhythmogenesis and variable effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in patients in the presence or absence of impaired Pitx2 expression remain unclear. We have developed multi-scale computer models, ranging from a single cell to tissue level, to mimic control and Pitx2-knockout atria by incorporating recent experimental data on Pitx2-induced electrical and structural remodeling in humans, as well as the effects of AADs. The key findings of this study are twofold. We have demonstrated that shortened action potential duration, slow conduction and triggered activity occur due to electrical and structural remodelling under Pitx2 deficiency conditions. Notably, the elevated function of calcium transport ATPase increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentration, thereby enhancing susceptibility to triggered activity. Furthermore, heterogeneity is further elevated due to Pitx2 deficiency: 1) Electrical heterogeneity between left and right atria increases; and 2) Increased fibrosis and decreased cell-cell coupling due to structural remodelling slow electrical propagation and provide obstacles to attract re-entry, facilitating the initiation of re-entrant circuits. Secondly, our study suggests that flecainide has antiarrhythmic effects on AF due to impaired Pitx2 by preventing spontaneous calcium release and increasing wavelength. Furthermore, our study suggests that Na+ channel effects alone are insufficient to explain the efficacy of flecainide. Our study may provide the mechanisms underlying Pitx2-induced AF and possible explanation behind the AAD effects of flecainide in patients with Pitx2 deficiency.","PLoS computational biology","32097431",2020,"United States"
"Computational prediction of the effect of D172N KCNJ2 mutation on ventricular pumping during sinus rhythm and reentry.","The understanding of cardiac arrhythmia under genetic mutations has grown in interest among researchers. Previous studies focused on the effect of the D172N mutation on electrophysiological behavior. In this study, we analyzed not only the electrophysiological activity but also the mechanical responses during normal sinus rhythm and reentry conditions by using computational modeling. We simulated four different ventricular conditions including normal case of ten Tusscher model 2006 (TTM), wild-type (WT), heterozygous (WT/D172N), and homozygous D172N mutation. The 2D simulation result (in wire-shaped mesh) showed the WT/D172N and D172N mutation shortened the action potential duration by 14%, and by 23%, respectively. The 3D electrophysiological simulation results showed that the electrical wavelength between TTM and WT conditions were identical. Under sinus rhythm condition, the WT/D172N and D172N reduced the pumping efficacy with a lower left ventricle (LV) and aortic pressures, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. Under the reentry conditions, the WT condition has a small probability of reentry. However, in the event of reentry, WT has shown the most severe condition. Furthermore, we found that the position of the rotor or the scroll wave substantially influenced the ventricular pumping efficacy during arrhythmia. If the rotor stays in the LV, it will cause very poor pumping performance. Graphical Abstract A model of a ventricular electromechanical system. This whole model was established to observe the effect of D172N KCNJ2 mutation on ventricular pumping behavior during sinus rhythm and reentry conditions. The model consists of two components; electrical component and mechanical component. The electrophysiological model based on ten Tusscher et al. with the IK1 D172N KCNJ2 mutation, and the myofilament dynamic (cross-bridge) model based on Rice et al. study. The 3D electrical component is a ventricular geometry based on MRI which composed of nodes representing single-cell with electrophysiological activation. The 3D ventricular mechanic is a finite element mesh composed of single-cells myofilament dynamic model. Both components were coupled with Ca2+ concentration. We used Gaussian points for the calcium interpolation from the electrical mesh to the mechanical mesh.","Medical &amp; biological engineering &amp; computing","32095980",2020,"United States"
"Interferon lambda promotes immune dysregulation and tissue inflammation in TLR7-induced lupus.","Type III IFN lambdas (IFN-¦Ë) have recently been described as important mediators of immune responses at barrier surfaces. However, their role in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition characterized by aberrant type I IFN signaling, has not been determined. Here, we identify a nonredundant role for IFN-¦Ë in immune dysregulation and tissue inflammation in a model of TLR7-induced lupus. IFN-¦Ë protein is increased in murine lupus and IFN-¦Ë receptor (Ifnlr1) deficiency significantly reduces immune cell activation and associated organ damage in the skin and kidneys without effects on autoantibody production. Single-cell RNA sequencing in mouse spleen and human peripheral blood revealed that only mouse neutrophils and human B cells are directly responsive to this cytokine. Rather, IFN-¦Ë activates keratinocytes and mesangial cells to produce chemokines that induce immune cell recruitment and promote tissue inflammation. These data provide insights into the immunobiology of SLE and identify type III IFNs as important factors for tissue-specific pathology in this disease.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","32094169",2020,"United States"

"Functional Heterogeneity within the Developing Zebrafish Epicardium.","The epicardium is essential during cardiac development, homeostasis, and repair, and yet fundamental insights into its underlying cell biology, notably epicardium formation, lineage heterogeneity, and functional cross-talk with other cell types in the heart, are currently lacking. In this study, we investigated epicardial heterogeneity and the functional diversity of discrete epicardial subpopulations in the developing zebrafish heart. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered three epicardial subpopulations with specific genetic programs and distinctive spatial distribution. Perturbation of unique gene signatures uncovered specific functions associated with each subpopulation and established epicardial roles in cell adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis as a mechanism for recruitment of leukocytes into the heart. Understanding which mechanisms epicardial cells employ to establish a functional epicardium and how they communicate with other cardiovascular cell types during development will bring us closer to repairing cellular relationships that are disrupted during cardiovascular disease.","Developmental cell","32084358",2020,"United Kingdom"

Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8¦Á¦Á<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment.

"Misregulation of ELK1, AP1, and E12 Transcription Factor Networks Is Associated with Melanoma Progression.","Melanoma is among the most malignant cutaneous cancers and when metastasized results in dramatically high mortality. Despite advances in high-throughput gene expression profiling in cancer transcriptomic studies, our understanding of mechanisms driving melanoma progression is still limited. We present here an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of the melanoma RNAseq, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)seq, and single-cell (sc)RNA seq data to understand cancer progression. Specifically, we have performed a consensus network analysis of RNA-seq data from clinically re-grouped melanoma samples to identify gene co-expression networks that are conserved in early (stage 1) and late (stage 4/invasive) stage melanoma. Overlaying the fold-change information on co-expression networks revealed several coordinately up or down-regulated subnetworks that may play a critical role in melanoma progression. Furthermore, by incorporating histone lysine-27 acetylation information and highly expressed genes identified from the single-cell RNA data from melanoma patient samples, we present a comprehensive list of pathways, putative protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and transcription factor (TF) networks that are driving cancer progression. From this analysis, we have identified Elk1, AP1 and E12 TF networks that coordinately change expression in late melanoma when compared to early melanoma, implicating these TFs in melanoma progression. Additionally, the sumoylation-associated interactome is upregulated in invasive melanoma. Together, this bioinformatic analysis potentially implicates a combination of TF networks and PPIs in melanoma progression, which if confirmed in the experimental systems, could be used as targets for drug intervention in melanoma.","Cancers","32079144",2020,"Switzerland"

"In Vitro and In Vivo Preclinical Testing of Pericyte-Engineered Grafts for the Correction of Congenital Heart Defects.","Background We have previously reported the possibility of using pericytes from leftovers of palliative surgery of congenital heart disease to engineer clinically certified prosthetic grafts. Methods and Results Here, we assessed the feasibility of using prosthetic conduits engineered with neonatal swine pericytes to reconstruct the pulmonary artery of 9-week-old piglets. Human and swine cardiac pericytes were similar regarding anatomical localization in the heart and antigenic profile following isolation and culture expansion. Like human pericytes, the swine surrogates form clones after single-cell sorting, secrete angiogenic factors, and extracellular matrix proteins and support endothelial cell migration and network formation in<U+00A0>vitro. Swine pericytes seeded or unseeded (control) CorMatrix conduits were cultured under static conditions for 5<U+00A0>days, then they were shaped into conduits and incubated in a flow bioreactor for 1 or 2<U+00A0>weeks. Immunohistological studies showed the viability and integration of pericytes in the outer layer of the conduit. Mechanical tests documented a reduction in stiffness and an increase in strain at maximum load in seeded conduits in comparison with unseeded conduits. Control and pericyte-engineered conduits were then used to replace the left pulmonary artery of piglets. After 4<U+00A0>months, anatomical and functional integration of the grafts was confirmed using Doppler echography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and histology. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using neonatal cardiac pericytes for reconstruction of small-size branch pulmonary arteries in a large animal model.","Journal of the American Heart Association","32067581",2020,"United Kingdom"
"Single-cell analysis of human adipose tissue identifies depot and disease specific cell types.","The complex relationship between metabolic disease risk and body fat distribution in humans involves cellular characteristics which are specific to body fat compartments. Here we show depot-specific differences in the stromal vascual fraction of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue by performing single-cell RNA sequencing of tissue specimen from obese individuals. We characterize multiple immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipose and hematopoietic stem cell progenitors. Subpopulations of adipose-resident immune cells are metabolically active and associated with metabolic disease status and those include a population of potential dysfunctional CD8+ T cells expressing metallothioneins. We identify multiple types of adipocyte progenitors that are common across depots, including a subtype enriched in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Depot-specific analysis reveals a class of adipocyte progenitors unique to visceral adipose tissue, which shares common features with beige preadipocytes.

"Proteostasis in thermogenesis and obesity.","The proper production, degradation, folding and activity of proteins, proteostasis, is essential for any cellular function. From single cell organisms to humans, selective pressures have led to the evolution of adaptive programs that ensure proteins are properly produced and disposed of when necessary. Environmental factors such as temperature, nutrient availability, pathogens as well as predators have greatly influenced the development of mechanisms such as the unfolded protein response, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation and autophagy, working together in concert to secure cellular proteostasis. In our modern society, the metabolic systems of the human body face the distinct challenge of changed diets, chronic overnutrition and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity and excess white adipose tissue accumulation are linked to a cluster of metabolic diseases and disturbed proteostasis is a common feature. Conversely, processes that promote energy expenditure such as exercise, shivering as well as non-shivering thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipocytes counteract metabolic dysfunction. Here we review the basic concepts of proteostasis in obesity-linked metabolic diseases and focus on adipocytes, which are critical regulators of mammalian energy metabolism.","Biological chemistry","32061163",2020,"Germany"
"High-contrast, synchronous volumetric imaging with selective volume illumination microscopy.","Light-field fluorescence microscopy uniquely provides fast, synchronous volumetric imaging by capturing an extended volume in one snapshot, but often suffers from low contrast due to the background signal generated by its wide-field illumination strategy. We implemented light-field-based selective volume illumination microscopy (SVIM), where illumination is confined to only the volume of interest, removing the background generated from the extraneous sample volume, and dramatically enhancing the image contrast. We demonstrate the capabilities of SVIM by capturing cellular-resolution 3D movies of flowing bacteria in seawater as they colonize their squid symbiotic partner, as well as of the beating heart and brain-wide neural activity in larval zebrafish. These applications demonstrate the breadth of imaging applications that we envision SVIM will enable, in capturing tissue-scale 3D dynamic biological systems at single-cell resolution, fast volumetric rates, and high contrast to reveal the underlying biology.","Communications biology","32060411",2020,"United States"
"Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of Murine Endothelial Cells.","The heterogeneity of endothelial cells (ECs) across tissues remains incompletely inventoried.

ECs from brain/testis, liver/spleen, small intestine/colon, and skeletal muscle/heart pairwise expressed partially overlapping marker genes. Arterial, venous, and lymphatic ECs shared more markers in more tissues than did heterogeneous capillary ECs. ECs from different vascular beds (arteries, capillaries, veins, lymphatics) exhibited transcriptome similarity across tissues, but the tissue (rather than the vessel) type contributed to the EC heterogeneity. Metabolic transcriptome analysis revealed a similar tissue-grouping phenomenon of ECs and heterogeneous metabolic gene signatures in ECs between<U+00A0>tissues and between vascular beds within a single tissue in a tissue-type-dependent pattern.

AF gene expression changes with advancing gestation reflect fetal development and organ maturation; yet, defining normal expression and splicing patterns for biomarker discovery in obstetrics requires larger heterogeneous cohorts, evaluation of potential confounding factors, and novel analytical approaches.METHODS: Women with a normal pregnancy who had an AF sample collected during midtrimester (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>30) or at term gestation (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>68) were included.

The expression of tissue-specific and cell-type specific signatures defined by single-cell genomics was quantified and correlated with covariates. In-silico validation studies were performed using publicly available datasets.RESULTS: 1) 64,071 genes were detected in AF, with 11% of the coding and 6% of the non-coding genes being differentially expressed between midtrimester and term gestation. Expression changes were highly correlated with those previously reported (R<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>0.79, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and featured increased expression of genes specific to the trachea, salivary glands, and lung and decreased expression of genes specific to the cardiac myocytes, uterus, and fetal liver, among others. 2) Single-cell RNA-seq signatures of the cytotrophoblast, Hofbauer cells, erythrocytes, monocytes, T and B cells, among others, showed complex patterns of modulation with gestation (adjusted p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). 3) In 17% of the genes detected, we found differential splicing with advancing gestation in genes related to brain development processes and immunity pathways, including some that were missed based on differential expression analysis alone.CONCLUSIONS: This represents the largest AF transcriptomics study in normal pregnancy, reporting for the first time that single-cell genomic signatures can be tracked in the AF and display complex patterns of expression during gestation. We also demonstrate a role for alternative splicing in tissue-identity acquisition, organ development, and immune processes. The results herein may have implications for the development of fetal testing to assess placental function and fetal organ maturity.","BMC medical genomics","32050959",2020,"United States"
"Cxcr4 distinguishes HSC-derived monocytes from microglia and reveals monocyte immune responses to experimental stroke.","Monocyte-derived and tissue-resident macrophages are ontogenetically distinct components of the innate immune system. Assessment of their respective functions in pathology is complicated by changes to the macrophage phenotype during inflammation. Here we find that Cxcr4-CreER enables permanent genetic labeling of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and distinguishes HSC-derived monocytes from microglia and other tissue-resident macrophages. By combining Cxcr4-CreER-mediated lineage tracing with Cxcr4 inhibition or conditional Cxcr4 ablation in photothrombotic stroke, we find that Cxcr4 promotes initial monocyte infiltration and subsequent territorial restriction of monocyte-derived macrophages to infarct tissue. After transient focal ischemia, Cxcr4 deficiency reduces monocyte infiltration and blunts the expression of pattern recognition and defense response genes in monocyte-derived macrophages. This is associated with an altered microglial response and deteriorated outcomes. Thus, Cxcr4 is essential for an innate-immune-system-mediated defense response after cerebral ischemia. We further propose Cxcr4-CreER as a universal tool to study functions of HSC-derived cells.","Nature neuroscience","32042176",2020,"United States"
"Cardiac Fibroblast Diversity.","Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological condition that occurs after injury and during aging. Currently, there are limited means to effectively reduce or reverse fibrosis. Key to identifying methods for curbing excess deposition of extracellular matrix is a better understanding of the cardiac fibroblast, the cell responsible for collagen production. In recent years, the diversity and functions of these enigmatic cells have been gradually revealed. In this review, I outline current approaches for identifying and classifying cardiac fibroblasts. An emphasis is placed on new insights into the heterogeneity of these cells as determined by lineage tracing and single-cell sequencing in development, adult, and disease states. These recent advances in our understanding of the fibroblast provide a platform for future development of novel therapeutics to combat cardiac fibrosis.","Annual review of physiology","32040933",2020,"United States"

"Optical Imaging of Isolated Murine Ventricular Myocytes.","The ability to isolate adult cardiac myocytes has permitted researchers to study a variety of cardiac pathologies at the single cell level. While advances in calcium sensitive dyes have permitted the robust optical recording of single cell calcium dynamics, recording of robust transmembrane optical voltage signals has remained difficult. Arguably, this is because of the low single to noise ratio, phototoxicity, and photobleaching of traditional potentiometric dyes. Therefore, single cell voltage measurements have long been confined to the patch clamp technique which while the gold standard, is technically demanding and low throughput. However, with the development of novel potentiometric dyes, large, fast optical responses to changes in voltage can be obtained with little to no phototoxicity and photobleaching. This protocol describes in detail how to isolate adult murine myocytes which can be used for cellular shortening, calcium, and optical voltage measurements. Specifically, the protocol describes how to use a ratiometric calcium dye, a single-excitation calcium dye, and a single excitation voltage dye. This approach can be used to assess the cardiotoxicity and arrhythmogenicity of various chemical agents. While phototoxicity is still an issue at the single cell level, methodology is discussed on how to reduce it.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","32009641",2020,"United States"

"Systematic Comparison of High-throughput Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus Transcriptomes during Cardiomyocyte Differentiation.","A comprehensive reference map of all cell types in the human body is necessary for improving our understanding of fundamental biological processes and in diagnosing and treating disease. High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify and characterize cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues. However, extracting intact cells from tissues and organs is often technically challenging or impossible, for example in heart or brain tissue. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing provides an alternative way to obtain transcriptome profiles of such tissues. To systematically assess the differences between high-throughput single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq approaches, we compared Drop-seq and DroNc-seq, two microfluidic-based 3' RNA capture technologies that profile total cellular and nuclear RNA, respectively, during a time course experiment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Clustering of time-series transcriptomes from Drop-seq and DroNc-seq revealed six distinct cell types, five of which were found in both techniques. Furthermore, single-cell trajectories reconstructed from both techniques reproduced expected differentiation dynamics. We then applied DroNc-seq to postmortem heart tissue to test its performance on heterogeneous human tissue samples. Our data confirm that DroNc-seq yields similar results to Drop-seq on matched samples and can be successfully used to generate reference maps for the human cell atlas.","Scientific reports","32001747",2020,"United States"
"Pro-efferocytic nanoparticles are specifically taken up by lesional macrophages and prevent atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerosis is the process that underlies heart attack and stroke. A characteristic feature of the atherosclerotic plaque is the accumulation of apoptotic cells in the necrotic core. Prophagocytic antibody-based therapies are currently being explored to stimulate the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells; however, these therapies can cause off-target clearance of healthy tissues, which leads to toxicities such as anaemia. Here we developed a macrophage-specific nanotherapy based on single-walled carbon nanotubes loaded with a chemical inhibitor of the antiphagocytic CD47-SIRP¦Á signalling axis. We demonstrate that these single-walled carbon nanotubes accumulate within the atherosclerotic plaque, reactivate lesional phagocytosis and reduce the plaque burden in atheroprone apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice without compromising safety, and thereby overcome a key translational barrier for this class of drugs. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that prophagocytic single-walled carbon nanotubes decrease the expression of inflammatory genes linked to cytokine and chemokine pathways in lesional macrophages, which demonstrates the potential of 'Trojan horse' nanoparticles to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Nature nanotechnology","31988506",2020,"United States"

"Guided migration analyses at the single-clone level uncover cellular targets of interest in tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations.","Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells that exert immunosuppression within the tumor, protecting cancer cells from the host's immune system and/or exogenous immunotherapies. While current research has been mostly focused in countering MDSC-driven immunosuppression, little is known about the mechanisms by which MDSCs disseminate/infiltrate cancerous tissue. This study looks into the use of microtextured surfaces, coupled with in vitro and in vivo cellular and molecular analysis tools, to videoscopically evaluate the dissemination patterns of MDSCs under structurally guided migration, at the single-cell level. MDSCs exhibited topographically driven migration, showing significant intra- and inter-population differences in motility, with velocities reaching ~40 ¦Ìm h<sup>-1</sup>. Downstream analyses coupled with single-cell migration uncovered the presence of specific MDSC subpopulations with different degrees of tumor-infiltrating and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Granulocytic MDSCs showed a ~¡Ý3-fold increase in maximum dissemination velocities and traveled distances, and a ~10-fold difference in the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. Prolonged culture also revealed that purified subpopulations of MDSCs exhibit remarkable plasticity, with homogeneous/sorted subpopulations giving rise to heterogenous cultures that represented the entire hierarchy of MDSC phenotypes within 7 days. These studies point towards the granulocytic subtype as a potential cellular target of interest given their superior dissemination ability and enhanced anti-inflammatory activity.","Scientific reports","31988310",2020,"England"
"Multiplexed Single Cell mRNA Sequencing Analysis of Mouse Embryonic Cells.","Single cell mRNA sequencing has made significant progress in the last several years and has become an important tool in the field of developmental biology.

Here we used the heart as an example to demonstrate how to profile the mouse embryonic tissue cells using the droplet based scRNA-Seq method. In addition, we have integrated two strategies into the workflow to profile multiple samples in a single experiment. Using one of the integrated methods, we have simultaneously profiled more than 9,000 cells from eight heart samples.

"Different strategies for tissue scaling in dwarf tailbud embryos revealed by single-cell analysis.","The tailbud stage is part of the organogenesis period-an evolutionarily conserved developmental period among chordates that is essential for determining the characteristics of the chordate body plan. When the volume of the egg is artificially decreased by cutting, ascidians produce a normal-looking but miniature (dwarf) tailbud embryo. Although cell lineages during ascidian embryogenesis are invariant, the number of cell divisions in the dwarf embryo is altered by a different mechanism in each tissue (Yamada and Nishida, 1999). Here, to elucidate the size-regulation strategies of the Ciona robusta dwarf tailbud embryo, we compared anatomical structure, developmental speed, and cell number/volume in each tissue between dwarf and wild type (WT) embryos. To do this, we constructed a 3D virtual mid-tailbud embryo (Nakamura et<U+00A0>al., 2012). We could make a Ciona dwarf tailbud embryo from eggs with a diameter over 108<U+00A0><U+200B>¦Ìm (correspond to<U+00A0><U+200B>&gt;<U+00A0><U+200B>40% of the wild type egg volume). The timings of cleavage (~St. 12) and subsequent morphogenesis were nearly the same but blastomeres of animal hemisphere slightly delayed the timing of mitosis in the early cleavage period. Intriguingly, the tissue-to-tissue volume ratios of dwarf tailbud embryos were similar to those of wild type embryos suggesting that the ratio of tissue volumes is essential for maintaining the proper shape of the tailbud embryo. The number of cells in the epidermis, nervous system, and mesenchyme was significantly reduced in the dwarf embryos whereas the cell volume distribution of these tissues was similar in the dwarf and wild type. In contrast, the number of cells in the notochord, muscle, heart, and endoderm were maintained in the dwarf embryos; cell volumes were significantly reduced. Neither parameter changed in germline precursors. These results indicate that each tissue uses different scaling strategies to coordinate cell number and cell volume in accordance with the embryo size.","Developmental biology","31981562",2020,"United States"
"Single cell and genetic analyses reveal conserved populations and signaling mechanisms of gastrointestinal stromal niches.","Stomach and intestinal stem cells are located in discrete niches called the isthmus and crypt, respectively. Recent studies have demonstrated a surprisingly conserved role for Wnt signaling in gastrointestinal development. Although intestinal stromal cells secrete Wnt ligands to promote stem cell renewal, the source of stomach Wnt ligands is still unclear. Here, by performing single cell analysis, we identify gastrointestinal stromal cell populations with transcriptome signatures that are conserved between the stomach and intestine. In close proximity to epithelial cells, these perictye-like cells highly express telocyte and pericyte markers as well as Wnt ligands, and they are enriched for Hh signaling. By analyzing mice activated for Hh signaling, we show a conserved mechanism of GLI2 activation of Wnt ligands. Moreover, genetic inhibition of Wnt secretion in perictye-like stromal cells or stromal cells more broadly demonstrates their essential roles in gastrointestinal regeneration and development, respectively, highlighting a redundancy in gastrointestinal stem cell niches.","Nature communications","31953387",2020,"England"
"Endothelial heterogeneity across distinct vascular beds during homeostasis and inflammation.","Blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells engaged in distinct organ-specific functions but little is known about their characteristic gene expression profiles. RNA-Sequencing of the brain, lung, and heart endothelial translatome identified specific pathways, transporters and cell-surface markers expressed in the endothelium of each organ, which can be visualized at http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo. We found that endothelial cells express genes typically found in the surrounding tissues such as synaptic vesicle genes in the brain endothelium and cardiac contractile genes in the heart endothelium. Complementary analysis of endothelial single cell RNA-Seq data identified the molecular signatures shared across the endothelial translatome and single cell transcriptomes. The tissue-specific heterogeneity of the endothelium is maintained during systemic in vivo inflammatory injury as evidenced by the distinct responses to inflammatory stimulation. Our study defines endothelial heterogeneity and plasticity and provides a molecular framework to understand organ-specific vascular disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting of individual vascular beds.Blood vessels supply nutrients, oxygen and other key molecules to all of the organs in the body. Cells lining the blood vessels, called endothelial cells, regulate which molecules pass from the blood to the organs they supply. For example, brain endothelial cells prevent toxic molecules from getting into the brain, and lung endothelial cells allow immune cells into the lungs to fight off bacteria or viruses.Determining which genes are switched on in the endothelial cells of major organs might allow scientists to determine what endothelial cells do in the brain, heart, and lung, and how they differ; or help scientists deliver drugs to a particular organ. If endothelial cells from different organs switch on different groups of genes, each of these groups of genes can be thought of as a ¡®genetic signature¡¯ that identifies endothelial cells from a specific organ.Now, Jambusaria et al. show that brain, heart, and lung endothelial cells have distinct genetic signatures. The experiments used mice that had been genetically modified to have tags on their endothelial cells. These tags made it possible to isolate RNA ¨C a molecule similar to DNA that contains the information about which genes are active ¨C from endothelial cells without separating the cells from their tissue of origin. Next, RNA from endothelial cells in the heart, brain and lung was sequenced and analyzed.The results show that each endothelial cell type has a distinct genetic signature under normal conditions and infection-like conditions. Unexpectedly, the experiments also showed that genes that were thought to only be switched on in the cells of specific tissues are also on in the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of the tissue. For example, genes switched on in brain cells are also active in brain endothelial cells, and genes allowing heart muscle cells to pump are also on in the endothelial cells of the heart blood vessels.The endothelial cell genetic signatures identified by Jambusaria et al. can be used as ¡°postal codes¡± to target drugs to a specific organ via the endothelial cells that feed it. It might also be possible to use these genetic signatures to build organ-specific blood vessels from stem cells in the laboratory. Future work will try to answer why endothelial cells serving the heart and brain use genes from these organs.","eLife","31944177",2020,"United States"
"Chemosensitization of prostate cancer stem cells in mice by angiogenin and plexin-B2 inhibitors.","Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are an obstacle in cancer therapy and are a major cause of drug resistance, cancer recurrence, and metastasis. Available treatments, targeting proliferating cancer cells, are not effective in eliminating quiescent CSCs. Identification of CSC regulators will help design therapeutic strategies to sensitize drug-resistant CSCs for chemo-eradication. Here, we show that angiogenin and plexin-B2 regulate the stemness of prostate CSCs, and that inhibitors of angiogenin/plexin-B2 sensitize prostate CSCs to chemotherapy. Prostate CSCs capable of self-renewal, differentiation, and tumor initiation with a single cell inoculation were identified and shown to be regulated by angiogenin/plexin-B2 that promotes quiescence and self-renewal through 5S ribosomal RNA processing and generation of the bioactive 3'-end fragments of 5S ribosomal RNA, which suppress protein translation and restrict cell cycling. Monoclonal antibodies of angiogenin and plexin-B2 decrease the stemness of prostate CSCs and sensitize them to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.","Communications biology","31942000",2020,"United States"
"FLOW-MAP: a graph-based, force-directed layout algorithm for trajectory mapping in single-cell time course datasets.","High-dimensional single-cell technologies present new opportunities for biological discovery, but the complex nature of the resulting datasets makes it challenging to perform comprehensive analysis. One particular challenge is the analysis of single-cell time course datasets: how to identify unique cell populations and track how they change across time points. To facilitate this analysis, we developed FLOW-MAP, a graphical user interface (GUI)-based software tool that uses graph layout analysis with sequential time ordering to visualize cellular trajectories in high-dimensional single-cell datasets obtained from flow cytometry, mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments. Here we provide a detailed description of the FLOW-MAP algorithm and how to use the open-source R package FLOWMAPR via its GUI or with text-based commands. This approach can be applied to many dynamic processes, including in vitro stem cell differentiation, in vivo development, oncogenesis, the emergence of drug resistance and cell signaling dynamics. To demonstrate our approach, we perform a step-by-step analysis of a single-cell mass cytometry time course dataset from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. In addition, we demonstrate FLOW-MAP analysis of a previously published scRNAseq dataset. Using both synthetic and experimental datasets for comparison, we perform FLOW-MAP analysis side by side with other single-cell analysis methods, to illustrate when it is advantageous to use the FLOW-MAP approach. The protocol takes between 30 min and 1.5 h to complete.","Nature protocols","31932774",2020,"United States"
"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of the Cardiovascular System: New Looks for Old Diseases.","Cardiovascular disease encompasses a wide range of conditions, resulting in the highest number of deaths worldwide. The underlying pathologies surrounding cardiovascular disease include a vast and complicated network of both cellular and molecular mechanisms. Unique phenotypic alterations in specific cell types, visualized as varying RNA expression-levels (both coding and non-coding), have been identified as crucial factors in the pathology underlying conditions such as heart failure and atherosclerosis. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have elucidated a new realm of cell subpopulations and transcriptional variations that are associated with normal and pathological physiology in a wide variety of diseases. This breakthrough in the phenotypical understanding of our cells has brought novel insight into cardiovascular basic science. scRNA-seq allows for separation of widely distinct cell subpopulations which were, until recently, simply averaged together with bulk-tissue RNA-seq. scRNA-seq has been used to identify novel cell types in the heart and vasculature that could be implicated in a variety of disease pathologies. Furthermore, scRNA-seq has been able to identify significant heterogeneity of phenotypes within individual cell subtype populations. The ability to characterize single cells based on transcriptional phenotypes allows researchers the ability to map development of cells and identify changes in specific subpopulations due to diseases at a very high throughput. This review looks at recent scRNA-seq studies of various aspects of the cardiovascular system and discusses their potential value to our understanding of the cardiovascular system and pathology.","Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine","31921894",2020,"United States"
"Dynamics of human monocytes and airway macrophages during healthy aging and after transplant.","The ontogeny of airway macrophages (AMs) in human lung and their contribution to disease are poorly mapped out. In mice, aging is associated with an increasing proportion of peripherally, as opposed to perinatally derived AMs. We sought to understand AM ontogeny in human lung during healthy aging and after transplant. We characterized monocyte/macrophage populations from the peripheral blood and airways of healthy volunteers across infancy/childhood (2-12 yr), maturity (20-50 yr), and older adulthood (&gt;50 yr). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on airway inflammatory cells isolated from sex-mismatched lung transplant recipients. During healthy aging, the proportions of blood bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) classical monocytes peak in adulthood and decline in older adults. scRNA-seq of BAL cells from lung transplant recipients indicates that after transplant, the majority of AMs are recipient derived. These data show that during aging, the peripheral monocyte phenotype is consistent with that found in the airways and, furthermore, that the majority of human AMs after transplant are derived from circulating monocytes.","The Journal of experimental medicine","31917836",2020,"United Kingdom"
"Single-cell reconstruction of the adult human heart during heart failure and recovery reveals the cellular landscape underlying cardiac function.","Owing to the prevalence and high mortality rates of cardiac diseases, a more detailed characterization of the human heart is necessary; however, this has been largely impeded by the cellular diversity of cardiac tissue and limited access to samples. Here, we show transcriptome profiling of 21,422 single cells-including cardiomyocytes (CMs) and non-CMs (NCMs)-from normal, failed and partially recovered (left ventricular assist device treatment) adult human hearts. Comparative analysis of atrial and ventricular cells revealed pronounced inter- and intracompartmental CM heterogeneity as well as compartment-specific utilization of NCM cell types as major cell-communication hubs. Systematic analysis of cellular compositions and cell-cell interaction networks showed that CM contractility and metabolism are the most prominent aspects that are correlated with changes in heart function. We also uncovered active engagement of NCMs in regulating the behaviour of CMs, exemplified by ACKR1<sup>+</sup>-endothelial cells, injection of which preserved cardiac function after injury. Beyond serving as a rich resource, our study provides insights into cell-type-targeted intervention of heart diseases.","Nature cell biology","31915373",2020,"England"

"Cloud accelerated alignment and assembly of full-length single-cell RNA-seq data using Falco.","BACKGROUND: Read alignment and transcript assembly are the core of RNA-seq analysis for transcript isoform discovery. Nonetheless, current tools are not designed to be scalable for analysis of full-length bulk or single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. The previous version of our cloud-based tool Falco only focuses on RNA-seq read counting, but does not allow for more flexible steps such as alignment and read assembly.RESULTS: The Falco framework can harness the parallel and distributed computing environment in modern cloud platforms to accelerate read alignment and transcript assembly of full-length bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. There are two new modes in Falco: alignment-only and transcript assembly. In the alignment-only mode, Falco can speed up the alignment process by 2.5-16.4x based on two public scRNA-seq datasets when compared to alignment on a highly optimised standalone computer. Furthermore, it also provides a 10x average speed-up compared to alignment using published cloud-enabled tool for read alignment, Rail-RNA. In the transcript assembly mode, Falco can speed up the transcript assembly process by 1.7-16.5x compared to performing transcript assembly on a highly optimised computer.CONCLUSION: Falco is a significantly updated open source big data processing framework that enables scalable and accelerated alignment and assembly of full-length scRNA-seq data on the cloud.

"Exploring the changing landscape of cell-to-cell variation after CTCF knockdown via single cell RNA-seq.","BACKGROUND: CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), also known as 11-zinc finger protein, participates in many cellular processes, including insulator activity, transcriptional regulation and organization of chromatin architecture. Based on single cell flow cytometry and single cell RNA-FISH analyses, our previous study showed that deletion of CTCF binding site led to a significantly increase of cellular variation of its target gene. However, the effect of CTCF on genome-wide landscape of cell-to-cell variation remains<U+00A0>unclear.RESULTS: We knocked down CTCF in EL4 cells using shRNA, and conducted single cell RNA-seq on both wild type (WT) cells and CTCF-Knockdown (CTCF-KD) cells using Fluidigm C1 system. Principal component analysis of single cell RNA-seq data showed that WT and CTCF-KD cells concentrated in two different clusters on PC1, indicating that<U+00A0>gene expression profiles of WT and CTCF-KD cells were systematically different. Interestingly, GO terms including regulation of transcription, DNA binding, zinc finger and transcription factor binding were significantly enriched in CTCF-KD-specific highly variable genes, implying<U+00A0>tissue-specific genes such as transcription factors were highly sensitive to CTCF level. The dysregulation of transcription factors potentially explains why knockdown of CTCF leads to systematic change of gene expression. In contrast, housekeeping genes such as rRNA processing, DNA repair and tRNA processing were significantly enriched in WT-specific highly variable genes, potentially due to a higher cellular variation of cell activity in WT cells compared to CTCF-KD cells. We further found that<U+00A0>cellular variation-increased genes were significantly enriched in down-regulated genes, indicating CTCF knockdown simultaneously reduced the expression levels and increased the expression noise of its regulated genes.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore genome-wide landscape of cellular variation after CTCF knockdown. Our study not only advances our understanding of CTCF function in maintaining gene expression and reducing expression noise, but also provides a framework for examining gene function.","BMC genomics","31878887",2019,"England"

"Regulation of ion transport from within ion transit pathways.","All cells must control the activities of their ion channels and transporters to maintain physiologically appropriate gradients of solutes and ions. The complexity of underlying regulatory mechanisms is staggering, as exemplified by insulin regulation of transporter trafficking. Simpler strategies occur in single-cell organisms, where subsets of transporters act as solute sensors to regulate expression of their active homologues. This Viewpoint highlights still simpler mechanisms by which Na transporters use their own transport sites as sensors for regulation. The underlying principle is inherent to Na/K pumps in which aspartate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are controlled by occupation of transport sites for Na and K, respectively. By this same principle, Na binding to transport sites can control intrinsic inactivation reactions that are in turn modified by extrinsic signaling factors. Cardiac Na/Ca exchangers (NCX1s) and Na/K pumps are the best examples. Inactivation of NCX1 occurs when cytoplasmic Na sites are fully occupied and is regulated by lipid signaling. Inactivation of cardiac Na/K pumps occurs when cytoplasmic Na-binding sites are not fully occupied, and inactivation is in turn regulated by Ca signaling. Potentially, Na/H exchangers (NHEs) and epithelial Na channels (ENaCs) are regulated similarly. Extracellular protons and cytoplasmic Na ions oppose secondary activation of NHEs by cytoplasmic protons. ENaCs undergo inactivation as cytoplasmic Na rises, and small diffusible molecules of an unidentified nature are likely involved. Multiple other ion channels have recently been shown to be regulated by transiting ions, thereby underscoring that ion permeation and channel gating need not be independent processes.","The Journal of general physiology","31875225",2019,"United States"
"Cell shape determines gene expression: cardiomyocyte morphotypic transcriptomes.","Cardiomyocytes undergo considerable changes in cell shape. These can be due to hemodynamic constraints, including changes in preload and afterload conditions, or to mutations in genes important for cardiac function. These changes instigate significant changes in cellular architecture and lead to the addition of sarcomeres, at the same time or at a later stage. However, it is currently unknown whether changes in cell shape on their own affect gene expression and the aim of this study was to fill that gap in our knowledge. We developed a single-cell morphotyping strategy, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing, to determine the effects of altered cell shape in gene expression. This enabled us to profile the transcriptomes of individual cardiomyocytes of defined geometrical morphotypes and characterize them as either normal or pathological conditions. We observed that deviations from normal cell shapes were associated with significant downregulation of gene expression and deactivation of specific pathways, like oxidative phosphorylation, protein kinase A, and cardiac beta-adrenergic signaling pathways. In addition, we observed that genes involved in apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and necrosis were upregulated in square-like pathological shapes. Mechano-sensory pathways, including integrin and Src kinase mediated signaling, appear to be involved in the regulation of shape-dependent gene expression. Our study demonstrates that cell shape per se affects the regulation of the transcriptome in cardiac myocytes, an effect with possible implications for cardiovascular disease.","Basic research in cardiology","31872302",2019,"Germany"
"Single-cell analysis uncovers that metabolic reprogramming by ErbB2 signaling is essential for cardiomyocyte proliferation in the regenerating heart.","While the heart regenerates poorly in mammals, efficient heart regeneration occurs in zebrafish. Studies in zebrafish have resulted in a model in which preexisting cardiomyocytes dedifferentiate and reinitiate proliferation to replace the lost myocardium. To identify which processes occur in proliferating cardiomyocytes we have used a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach. We uncovered that proliferating border zone cardiomyocytes have very distinct transcriptomes compared to the nonproliferating remote cardiomyocytes and that they resemble embryonic cardiomyocytes. Moreover, these cells have reduced expression of mitochondrial genes and reduced mitochondrial activity, while glycolysis gene expression and glucose uptake are increased, indicative for metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we find that the metabolic reprogramming of border zone cardiomyocytes is induced by Nrg1/ErbB2 signaling and is important for their proliferation. This mechanism is conserved in murine hearts in which cardiomyocyte proliferation is induced by activating ErbB2 signaling. Together these results demonstrate that glycolysis regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration.","eLife","31868166",2019,"International"
"Metabolic modulation regulates cardiac wall morphogenesis in zebrafish.","During cardiac development, cardiomyocytes form complex inner wall structures called trabeculae. Despite significant investigation into this process, the potential role of metabolism has not been addressed. Using single cell resolution imaging in zebrafish, we find that cardiomyocytes seeding the trabecular layer actively change their shape while compact layer cardiomyocytes remain static. We show that Erbb2 signaling, which is required for trabeculation, activates glycolysis to support changes in cardiomyocyte shape and behavior. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis impairs cardiac trabeculation, and cardiomyocyte-specific loss- and gain-of-function manipulations of glycolysis decrease and increase trabeculation, respectively. In addition, loss of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 impairs trabeculation. Experiments with rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in culture further support these observations. Our findings reveal new roles for glycolysis in regulating cardiomyocyte behavior during cardiac wall morphogenesis.","eLife","31868165",2019,"International"

"Genome-wide profiling of nucleosome position and chromatin accessibility in single cells using scMNase-seq.","Nucleosome organization is important for chromatin compaction and accessibility. Profiling nucleosome positioning genome-wide in single cells provides critical information to understand the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of chromatin states within a cell population. This protocol describes single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing (scMNase-seq), a method for detecting genome-wide nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility simultaneously from a small number of cells or single cells. To generate scMNase-seq libraries, single cells are isolated by FACS sorting, lysed and digested by MNase. DNA is purified, end-repaired and ligated to Y-shaped adaptors. Following PCR amplification with indexing primers, the subnucleosome-sized (fragments with a length of ¡Ü80 bp) and mononucleosome-sized (fragments with a length between 140 and 180 bp) DNA fragments are recovered and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platforms. On average, 0.5-1 million unique mapped reads are obtained for each single cell. The mononucleosome-sized DNA fragments precisely define genome-wide nucleosome positions in single cells, while the subnucleosome-sized DNA fragments provide information on chromatin accessibility. Library preparation of scMNase-seq takes only 2 d, requires only standard molecular biology techniques and does not require sophisticated laboratory equipment. Processing of high-throughput sequencing data requires basic bioinformatics skills and uses publicly available bioinformatics software.","Nature protocols","31836865",2019,"England"
"A Spatiotemporal Organ-Wide Gene Expression and Cell Atlas of the Developing Human Heart.","The process of cardiac morphogenesis in humans is incompletely understood.

Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions in each<U+00A0>developmental stage. Human embryonic cardiac cell<U+00A0>types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed and enriched the spatial annotation of embryonic cardiac gene expression.

"Fibrosis independent atrial fibrillation in older patients is driven by substrate leukocyte infiltration: diagnostic and prognostic implications to patients undergoing cardiac surgery.","BACKGROUND: The objectives of the study were to characterize and quantify cellular inflammation and structural remodeling of human atria and correlate findings with molecular markers of inflammation and patient surrogate outcome.METHODS: Voluntary participants undergoing heart surgery were enrolled in the study and blood samples were collected prior to surgery, and right atrium samples were harvested intraoperatively. Blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry and complete blood counts. Atrial samples were divided for fixed fibrosis analysis, homogenized for cytokine analysis and digested for single cell suspension flow cytometry.RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were enrolled and samples assessed. Isolated cells from the atria revealed a CD45+ population of ~<U+2009>20%, confirming a large number of leukocytes. Further characterization revealed this population as 57% lymphocytes and 26% monocyte/macrophages (Mo¦µ), with the majority of the latter cells being classical (CD14++/CD16-). Interstitial fibrosis was present in 87% of samples and correlated significantly with patient age. Older patients (&gt;<U+2009>65) had significantly more atrial fibrosis and cellular inflammation. AFib patients had no distinguishing feature of atrial fibrosis and had significantly greater CD45+ Mo¦µ, increased expression of MMP9 and presented with a significant correlation in length of stay to CCL-2/MCP-1 and NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio).CONCLUSION: Atrial fibrosis is correlated with age and not determinate to AFib. However, severity of atrial leukocyte infiltration and markers of matrix degradation are determinant to AFib. This also correlated with CCL2 (or MCP-1) and NLR-indicative of marked inflammation. These data show the potential importance of diagnostic and prognostic assessments that could inform clinical decision making in regard to the intensity of AFib patient management.","Journal of translational medicine","31822289",2019,"Canada"
"Cardiopharyngeal Progenitor Specification: Multiple Roads to the Heart and Head Muscles.","During embryonic development, the heart arises from various sources of undifferentiated mesodermal progenitors, with an additional contribution from ectodermal neural crest cells. Mesodermal cardiac progenitors are plastic and multipotent, but are nevertheless specified to a precise heart region and cell type very early during development. Recent findings have defined both this lineage plasticity and early commitment of cardiac progenitors, using a combination of single-cell and population analyses. In this review, we discuss several aspects of cardiac progenitor specification. We discuss their markers, fate potential in vitro and in vivo, early segregation and commitment, and also intrinsic and extrinsic cues regulating lineage restriction from multipotency to a specific cell type of the heart. Finally, we also discuss the subdivisions of the cardiopharyngeal field, and the shared origins of the heart with other mesodermal derivatives, including head and neck muscles.","Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology","31818856",2019,"United States"
"Spatiotemporal dynamics and heterogeneity of renal lymphatics in mammalian development and cystic kidney disease.","Heterogeneity of lymphatic vessels during embryogenesis is critical for organ-specific lymphatic function. Little is known about lymphatics in the developing kidney, despite their established roles in pathology of the mature organ. We performed three-dimensional imaging to characterize lymphatic vessel formation in the mammalian embryonic kidney at single-cell resolution. In mouse, we visually and quantitatively assessed the development of kidney lymphatic vessels, remodeling from a ring-like anastomosis under the nascent renal pelvis; a site of VEGF-C expression, to form a patent vascular plexus. We identified a heterogenous population of lymphatic endothelial cell clusters in mouse and human embryonic kidneys. Exogenous VEGF-C expanded the lymphatic population in explanted mouse embryonic kidneys. Finally, we characterized complex kidney lymphatic abnormalities in a genetic mouse model of polycystic kidney disease. Our study provides novel insights into the development of kidney lymphatic vasculature; a system which likely has fundamental roles in renal development, physiology and disease.","eLife","31808745",2019,"International"

"Refining the adipose progenitor cell landscape in healthy and obese visceral adipose tissue using single-cell gene expression profiling.","Obesity is a serious health concern and is associated with a reduced quality of life and a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. With obesity rates on the rise worldwide, adipose tissue biology has become a top biomedical research priority. Despite steady growth in obesity-related research, more investigation into the basic biology of adipose tissue is needed to drive innovative solutions aiming to curtail the obesity epidemic. Adipose progenitor cells (APCs) play a central role in adipose tissue homeostasis and coordinate adipose tissue expansion and remodeling. Although APCs are well studied, defining and characterizing APC subsets remains ambiguous because of ill-defined cellular heterogeneity within this cellular compartment. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cellular atlas of APC heterogeneity in mouse visceral adipose tissue. Our analysis identified two distinct populations of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) and three distinct populations of preadipocytes (PAs). We identified novel cell surface markers that, when used in combination with traditional ASC and preadipocyte markers, could discriminate between these APC subpopulations by flow cytometry. Prospective isolation and molecular characterization of these APC subpopulations confirmed single-cell RNA sequencing gene expression signatures, and ex vivo culture revealed differential expansion/differentiation capabilities. Obese visceral adipose tissue featured relative expansion of less mature ASC and PA subpopulations, and expression analyses revealed major obesity-associated signaling alterations within each APC subpopulation. Taken together, our study highlights cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity within the APC pool, provides new tools to prospectively isolate and study these novel subpopulations, and underscores the importance of considering APC diversity when studying the etiology of obesity.","Life science alliance","31767614",2019,"United States"
"Transcriptomic, epigenetic, and functional analyses implicate neutrophil diversity in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.","Neutrophil dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is characterized by elevated levels of a pathogenic neutrophil subset known as low-density granulocytes (LDGs). The origin and phenotypic, functional, and pathogenic heterogeneity of LDGs remain to be systematically determined. Transcriptomics and epigenetic assessment of lupus LDGs, autologous normal-density neutrophils, and healthy control neutrophils was performed by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing. Functional readouts were compared among neutrophil subsets. SLE LDGs display significant transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity and comprise 2 subpopulations of intermediate-mature and immature neutrophils, with different degrees of chromatin accessibility and differences in transcription factor motif analysis. Differences in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, oxidized mitochondrial DNA release, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, ability to harm the endothelium, and responses to type I interferon (IFN) stimulation are evident among LDG subsets. Compared with other immune cell subsets, LDGs display the highest expression of IFN-inducible genes. Distinct LDG subsets correlate with specific clinical features of lupus and with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease. Phenotypic, functional, and pathogenic neutrophil heterogeneity are prevalent in SLE and may promote immune dysregulation and prominent vascular damage characteristic of this disease.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","31754025",2019,"United States"

Compared to the large body of studies investigating cardiac maturation and cardiomyocyte subtype-specific induction, molecular events underlying cardiac lineage commitment from pluripotent stem cells at early stage remain poorly characterized.</AbstractText>: Cardiac differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells provides a unique opportunity to study human heart development in vitro and offers a potential cell source for cardiac regeneration. Compared to the large body of studies investigating cardiac maturation and cardiomyocyte subtype-specific induction, molecular events underlying cardiac lineage commitment from pluripotent stem cells at early stage remain poorly characterized.In order to uncover key molecular events and regulators controlling cardiac lineage commitment from a pluripotent state during differentiation, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq sequencing and obtained high-quality data for 6879 cells collected from 6 stages during cardiac differentiation from human embryonic stem cells and identified multiple cell subpopulations with distinct molecular features.

"DoubletDecon: Deconvoluting Doublets from Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data.","Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell types can appear as hybrid scRNA-seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic, mixed-species, genetic, and cell-hashing cell doublets from scRNA-seq datasets of varying cellular complexity with a high sensitivity relative to alternative approaches. Importantly, this algorithm prevents the prediction of valid mixed-lineage and transitional cell states as doublets by<U+00A0>considering their unique gene expression.

"TRPV4 Contributes to Stretch-Induced Hypercontractility and Time-Dependent Dysfunction in the Aged Heart.","AIMS: Cardiovascular disease remains the greatest cause of mortality in Americans over 65. The stretch-activated Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) ion channel is expressed in cardiomyocytes of the aged heart. This investigation tests the hypothesis that TRPV4 alters Ca2+ handling and cardiac function in response to increased ventricular preload and cardiomyocyte stretch.METHODS AND RESULTS: Left-ventricular maximal pressure (PMax) was monitored in isolated working hearts of Aged (24-27 months) mice following preload elevation from 5-20mmHg, with and without TRPV4 antagonist HC067047 (HC,1 ¦Ìmol/L). In preload-responsive hearts, PMax prior to and immediately following preload elevation (i.e., Frank-Starling response) was similar between Aged and Aged+HC. Within 1<U+2009>minute following preload elevation, Aged hearts demonstrated secondary PMax augmentation (Aged&gt;Aged+HC) suggesting a role for stretch-activated TRPV4 in cardiac hypercontractility. However, after 20<U+2009>minutes at 20mmHg Aged exhibited depressed PMax (Aged&lt;Aged+HC) suggestive of TRPV4-dependent contractile dysfunction with sustained stretch. To examine stretch-induced Ca2+ homeostasis at the single-cell level, isolated cardiomyocytes were stretched 10-15% of slack length while measuring intracellular Ca2+ with fura-2. Uniaxial longitudinal stretch increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and triggered Ca2+ overload and terminal cellular contracture in Aged, but not Aged+HC. Preload elevation in hearts of young/middle-age (3-12 month) mice produced an initial PMax increase (Frank-Starling response) without secondary PMax augmentation, and cardiomyocyte stretch did not affect intracellular Ca2+ levels. Hearts of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific TRPV4 expression exhibited PMax similar to 3-12 month control mice prior to and immediately following preload elevation but displayed secondary PMax augmentation. Cardiomyocytes of mice with transgenic TRPV4 expression were highly sensitive to mechanical stimulation and exhibited elevated Ca2+ levels, Ca2+ overload, and terminal contracture upon cellular attachment and stretch.CONCLUSIONS: TRPV4 contributes to a stretch-induced increase in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ and cardiac hypercontractility, yet sustained stretch leads to cardiomyocyte Ca2+ overload and contractile dysfunction in the aged heart.","Cardiovascular research","31693106",2019,"United States"
"Sheathless Acoustic Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (aFACS) with High Cell Viability.","In this work, we demonstrate a sheathless acoustic fluorescence activated cell sorting (aFACS) system by combining elasto-inertial cell focusing and highly focused traveling surface acoustic wave (FTSAW) to sort cells with high recovery rate, purity, and cell viability. The microfluidic sorting device utilizes elasto-inertial particle focusing to align cells in a single file for improving sorting accuracy and efficiency without sample dilution. Our sorting device can effectively focus 1 ¦Ìm particles which represents the general minimum size for a majority of cell sorting applications. Upon the fluorescence interrogation at the single cell level, individual cells are deflected to the target outlet by a ¡«50 ¦Ìm wide highly focused acoustic field. We have applied our aFACS to sort three different cell lines (i.e., MCF-7, MDA-231, and human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes; hiPSC-CMs) at ¡«kHz with a sorting purity and recovery rate both of about 90%. A further comparison demonstrates that the cell viability drops by 35-45% using a commercial FACS machine, while the cell viability only drops by 3-4% using our aFACS system. The developed aFACS system provides a benchtop solution for rapid, highly accurate single cell level sorting with high cell viability, in particular for sensitive cell types.","Analytical chemistry","31690076",2019,"United States"
"Conversion of human cardiac progenitor cells into cardiac pacemaker-like cells.","We used a screening strategy to test for reprogramming factors for the conversion of human cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) into Pacemaker-like cells. Human transcription factors SHOX2, TBX3, TBX5, TBX18, and the channel protein HCN2, were transiently induced as single factors and in trio combinations into CPCs, first transduced with the connexin 30.2 (CX30.2) mCherry reporter. Following screens for reporter CX30.2 mCherry gene activation and FACS enrichment, we observed the definitive expression of many pacemaker specific genes; including, CX30.2, KCNN4, HCN4, HCN3, HCN1, and SCN3b. These findings suggest that the SHOX2, HCN2, and TBX5 (SHT5) combination of transcription factors is a much better candidate in driving the CPCs into Pacemaker-like cells than other combinations and single transcription factors. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing of SHT5 mCherry+ cells revealed cellular enrichment of pacemaker specific genes including TBX3, KCNN4, CX30.2, and BMP2, as well as pacemaker specific potassium and calcium channels (KCND2, KCNK2, and CACNB1). In addition, similar to human and mouse sinoatrial node (SAN) studies, we also observed the down-regulation of NKX2.5. Patch-clamp recordings of the converted Pacemaker-like cells exhibited HCN currents demonstrated the functional characteristic of pacemaker cells. These studies will facilitate the development of an optimal Pacemaker-like cell-based therapy within failing hearts through the recovery of SAN dysfunction.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","31678351",2019,"United States"

"Association of Human iPSC Gene Signatures and X Chromosome Dosage with Two Distinct Cardiac Differentiation Trajectories.","Despite the importance of understanding how variability across induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines due to non-genetic factors (clone and passage) influences their differentiation outcome, large-scale studies capable of addressing this question have not yet been conducted. Here, we differentiated 191 iPSC lines to generate iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells (iPSC-CVPCs). We observed cellular heterogeneity across the iPSC-CVPC samples due to varying fractions of two cell types: cardiomyocytes (CMs) and epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs). Comparing the transcriptomes of CM-fated and EPDC-fated iPSCs, we discovered that 91 signature genes and X chromosome dosage differences are associated with these two distinct cardiac developmental trajectories. In an independent set of 39 iPSCs differentiated into CMs, we confirmed that sex and transcriptional differences affect cardiac-fate outcome. Our study provides novel insights into how iPSC transcriptional and X chromosome gene dosage differences influence their response to differentiation stimuli and, hence, cardiac cell fate.","Stem cell reports","31668852",2019,"United States"
"Single-Cell Sequencing of Mouse Heart Immune Infiltrate in Pressure Overload-Driven Heart Failure Reveals Extent of Immune Activation.","BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a key component of cardiac disease, with macrophages and T lymphocytes mediating essential roles in the progression to heart failure. Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.RESULTS: We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, Natural Killer cells, neutrophils, and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whereas mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as oncostatin M in proinflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in regulatory T cells, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of patients with heart failure to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, Natural Killer cells, and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardioimmunology to further investigation by using toolkits that have already been developed to study the aforementioned immune subsets. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for the diagnostics or therapy of heart failure.","Circulation","31661975",2019,"United States"

"Isolation of Cardiomyocytes Undergoing Mitosis With Complete Cytokinesis.","RATIONALE: Adult human cardiomyocytes do not complete cytokinesis despite passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle. As a result, polyploidization and multinucleation occur. To get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms surrounding division of cardiomyocytes, there is a crucial need for a technique to isolate cardiomyocytes that complete cell division/cytokinesis.OBJECTIVE: Markers of cell cycle progression based on DNA content cannot distinguish between mitotic cardiomyocytes that fail to complete cytokinesis from those cells that undergo true cell division. With the use of molecular beacons (MBs) targeting specific mRNAs, we aimed to identify truly proliferative cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a novel alternative to existing DNA content-based approaches for sorting cardiomyocytes with true mitotic potential that can be used to study the unique dynamics of cardiomyocyte nuclei during mitosis. Our technique for sorting live cardiomyocytes undergoing cytokinesis would provide a basis for future studies to uncover mechanisms underlying the development and regeneration of heart tissue.","Circulation research","31648614",2019,"United States"

Murine HSC co-express THBD, PAR1, and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), suggesting that HSC sustain quiescence in a quasi-cell autonomous manner due to the binding of thrombin present in the microenvironment to THBD, activation of EPCR-bound protein C by the thrombin-THBD-complex, and subsequent activation of PAR1 by the aPC-EPCR complex.OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of THBD expression on HSC for sustaining stem cell quiescence and BM retention under homeostatic conditions.METHODS: Hematopoietic stem cell function was analyzed in mice with constitutive or temporally controlled complete THBD-deficiency by flow cytometry, functional assays, and single cell RNA profiling.RESULTS: THBD was expressed in mouse, but not human, HSC, progenitors, and immature B cells. Expression in vascular endothelium was conserved in humans' BM. Mice with constitutive THBD deficiency had a normal peripheral blood profile, altered BM morphology, reduced numbers of progenitors and immature B cells, pronounced extramedullary hematopoiesis, increased HSC frequency, and marginally altered transcriptionally defined HSC stemness. Transplantation experiments indicated near normal engraftment and repopulating ability of THBD-deficient HSC. Transgenic aPC supplementation normalized BM histopathology and HSC abundance, and partially restored transcriptional stemness, but had no effect on B cell progenitors and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Temporally controlled THBD gene ablation in adult mice did not cause the above abnormalities.CONCLUSION: THBD expression on HSPC has minor effects on homeostatic hematopoiesis in mice, and is not conserved in humans.","Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","31628891",2019,"United States"

This intermediate gives rise to mature-like cardiomyocytes in control cells but, mutant cells transition to a pathological state with reduced fatty acid beta-oxidation, reduced mitochondrial proton gradient, disrupted cristae structure and defective cardiolipin remodeling. This study reveals that HADHA (tri-functional protein alpha), a monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-like enzyme, is required for fatty acid beta-oxidation and cardiolipin remodeling, essential for functional mitochondria in human cardiomyocytes.","Nature communications","31604922",2019,"United States"

"Control of cytokinesis by ¦Â-adrenergic receptors indicates an approach for regulating cardiomyocyte endowment.","One million patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) live in the United States. They have a lifelong risk of developing heart failure. Current concepts do not sufficiently address mechanisms of heart failure development specifically for these patients. Here, analysis of heart tissue from an infant with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (ToF/PS) labeled with isotope-tagged thymidine demonstrated that cardiomyocyte cytokinesis failure is increased in this common form of CHD. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to discover that the underlying mechanism of cytokinesis failure is repression of the cytokinesis gene ECT2, downstream of ¦Â-adrenergic receptors (¦Â-ARs). Inactivation of the ¦Â-AR genes and administration of the ¦Â-blocker propranolol increased cardiomyocyte division in neonatal mice, which increased the number of cardiomyocytes (endowment) and conferred benefit after myocardial infarction in adults. Propranolol enabled the division of ToF/PS cardiomyocytes in vitro. These results suggest that ¦Â-blockers could be evaluated for increasing cardiomyocyte division in patients with ToF/PS and other types of CHD.","Science translational medicine","31597755",2019,"United States"

"Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of lung alveolarization and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. A key histopathological feature of BPD is stunted late lung development, where the process of alveolarization-the generation of alveolar gas exchange units-is impeded, through mechanisms that remain largely unclear. As such, there is interest in the clarification both of the pathomechanisms at play in affected lungs, and the mechanisms of de novo alveoli generation in healthy, developing lungs. A better understanding of normal and pathological alveolarization might reveal opportunities for improved medical management of affected infants. Furthermore, disturbances to the alveolar architecture are a key histopathological feature of several adult chronic lung diseases, including emphysema and fibrosis, and it is envisaged that knowledge about the mechanisms of alveologenesis might facilitate regeneration of healthy lung parenchyma in affected patients. To this end, recent efforts have interrogated clinical data, developed new-and refined existing-in vivo and in vitro models of BPD, have applied new microscopic and radiographic approaches, and have developed advanced cell-culture approaches, including organoid generation. Advances have also been made in the development of other methodologies, including single-cell analysis, metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics, as well as the generation and use of complex mouse genetics tools. The objective of this review is to present advances made in our understanding of the mechanisms of lung alveolarization and BPD over the period 1 January 2017-30 June 2019, a period that spans the 50th anniversary of the original clinical description of BPD in preterm infants.","American journal of physiology.

"miR-27a/b is a posttranscriptional regulator of Gpr126 (Adgrg6).","Gpr126 (Adgrg6), a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family, has been associated with a variety of human diseases. Yet, despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms regulating Gpr126 expression are poorly understood. Here, we aimed at identifying upstream regulatory mechanisms of Gpr126 expression utilizing the heart as model organ in which Gpr126 regulates trabeculation. Here, we focused on possible regulation of Gpr126 regulation by microRNAs, which have emerged as key players in regulating development, have a critical role in disease progression, and might serve as putative therapeutic targets. In silico analyses identified one conserved binding site in the 3' UTR of Gpr126 for microRNA 27a and 27b (miR-27a/b). In addition, miR-27a/b and Gpr126 expression were differentially expressed during rat heart development. A regulatory role of miR-27a/b in controlling Gpr126 expression was substantiated by reduced Gpr126 mRNA levels upon ectopic expression of miR-27a/b in HEK293T cells and miR-27b in zebrafish embryos. Regulation of Gpr126 expression by direct binding of miR-27a/b to the 3' UTR of Gpr126 was verified by luciferase reporter assays in HEK293T cells. Finally, the modulation of gpr126 expression in zebrafish by injection of either miR-27b or miR-27b inhibitor in single cell-stage embryos resulted in hypo- or hypertrabeculation, respectively. Collectively, the data indicate that Gpr126 expression is regulated by miR-27a/b.","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","31596512",2019,"United States"

"Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of Mesp1-induced skeletal myogenic development.","The Mesp1 lineage contributes to cardiac, hematopoietic and skeletal myogenic development. Interestingly, muscle stem cells residing in craniofacial skeletal muscles primarily arise from Mesp1+ progenitors, but those in trunk and limb skeletal muscles do not. To gain insights into the difference between the head and trunk/limb muscle developmental processes, we studied Mesp1+ skeletal myogenic derivatives via single-cell RNA-seq and other strategies. Using a doxycycline-inducible Mesp1-expressing mouse embryonic stem cell line, we found that the development of Mesp1-induced skeletal myogenic progenitors can be characterized by dynamic expression of PDGFR¦Á and VCAM1. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis further revealed the heterogeneous nature of these Mesp1+ derivatives, spanning pluripotent and mesodermal to mesenchymal and skeletal myogenic. We subsequently reconstructed the single-cell trajectories of these subpopulations.

"Cell atlas of the fetal human heart and implications for autoimmune-mediated congenital heart block.","AIMS: Investigating human heart development and applying this to deviations resulting in disease is incomplete without molecular characterization of the cell types required for its normal functioning. We investigated fetal human heart single-cell transcriptomes from midgestational healthy and anti-Ro associated congenital heart block (CHB) samples, respectively.METHODS AND RESULTS: Three healthy fetal human hearts (19th-22nd week of gestation) and one fetal heart affected by autoimmune-associated CHB (21st week of gestation) were subjected to enzymatic dissociation using the Langendorff preparation to obtain single cell suspensions followed by 10x Genomics- and Illumina-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). In addition to the myocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, and other minor cell types, previously uncharacterized diverse subpopulations of endothelial cells were identified in the human heart. Differential gene expression analysis revealed increased and heterogeneous interferon responses in varied cell types the CHB heart compared to the healthy controls. In addition, we also identified matrisome transcripts enriched in CHB stromal cells that potentially contributing to extracellular matrix deposition and subsequent fibrosis.CONCLUSION: These data provide an information-rich resource to further understanding of human heart development, which, as illustrated by comparison to a heart exposed to a maternal autoimmune environment, can be leveraged to provide insight into the pathogenesis of disease.TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: This study provides a single cell transcriptomic atlas of cells obtained from healthy second trimester fetal hearts to further understand human heart development and impart insight into autoimmune associated congenital heart block. In addition to myocytes and fibroblasts, previously uncharacterized subpopulations of endothelial cells were identified. Leveraging an unprecedented opportunity, healthy heart transcriptomes were compared to an age matched anti-SSA/Ro exposed fetal heart with third degree block in which no maternal medications were taken. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a remarkable interferon response in many cell types of the diseased heart. In addition, matrisome transcripts were enriched in the stromal cells likely contributing to the extracellular matrix deposition and thereby fibrosis, a signature lesion of heart block. Thus, targeting the interferon pathway merits therapeutic consideration.","Cardiovascular research","31589297",2019,"England"

"Tet inactivation disrupts YY1 binding and long-range chromatin interactions during embryonic heart development.","Tet-mediated DNA demethylation plays an important role in shaping the epigenetic landscape and chromatin accessibility to control gene expression. While several studies demonstrated pivotal roles of Tet in regulating embryonic development, little is known about their functions in heart development. Here we analyze DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation dynamics during early cardiac development in both human and mice. We find that cardiac-specific deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 in mice (Tet2/3-DKO) leads to ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) with embryonic lethality. Single-cell RNA-seq analyses reveal a reduction in cardiomyocyte numbers and transcriptional reprogramming in cardiac tissues upon Tet2/3 depletion. Impaired DNA demethylation and reduced chromatin accessibility in Tet2/3-DKO mice further compromised Ying-yang1 (YY1) binding to its genomic targets, and perturbed high-order chromatin organization at key genes involved in heart development. Our studies provide evidence of the physiological role of Tet in regulating DNA methylation dynamics and chromatin organization during early heart development.","Nature communications","31541101",2019,"United States"
"cellHarmony: cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes.","To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell populations. We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.","Nucleic acids research","31529053",2019,"United States"

"Characterization of a novel LQT3 variant with a selective efficacy of mexiletine treatment.","Pathogenic variants in the human SCN5A gene encoding the a-subunit of the principle Na<sup>+</sup> channel (Nav1.5) are associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS) 3. LQT3 patients display variable responses to Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers demanding for the development of variant-specific therapeutic strategies. Here we performed a combined electrophysiological analysis with in silico simulation of variant channel to elucidate mechanisms of therapeutic responsiveness. We identified a novel SCN5A variant (A1656D) in a LQTS patient with a distinct response to mexiletine resulting in suppression of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and manifestation of premature atrial contraction. Patch clamp analysis revealed that A1656D variant exerted gain-of-function effects including hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage-dependence of activation, depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation, and slowing of fast inactivation. Among ranolazine, flecainide, and mexiletine, only mexiletine restored inactivation kinetics of A1656D currents. In silico simulation to assess the effect of A1656D variant on ventricular cardiac cell excitation predicted a prolonged action potential which is consistent with the prolonged QT and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia of the patient. It also predicted that only mexiletine suppressed the prolonged action potential of human ventricular myocytes expressing A1656D. These data elucidate the underlying mechanism of the distinct response to mexiletine in this patient.","Scientific reports","31506521",2019,"England"
"Differential effects on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of dihydropyridines: real-world data from population-based cohorts across two European countries.","AIMS: Various drugs increase the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the general population by impacting cardiac ion channels, thereby causing ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF). Dihydropyridines block L-type calcium channels, but their association with OHCA risk is unknown. We aimed to study whether nifedipine and/or amlodipine, often-used dihydropyridines, are associated with increased OHCA risk, and how these drugs impact on cardiac electrophysiology.METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a case-control study with VT/VF-documented OHCA cases with presumed cardiac cause from ongoing population-based OHCA registries in the Netherlands and Denmark, and age/sex/index date-matched non-OHCA controls (Netherlands: PHARMO Database Network, Denmark: Danish Civil Registration System). We included 2503 OHCA cases, 10<U+00A0>543 non-OHCA controls in Netherlands, and 8101 OHCA cases, 40<U+00A0>505 non-OHCA controls in Denmark. To examine drug effects on cardiac electrophysiology, we performed single-cell patch-clamp studies in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Use of high-dose nifedipine (¡Ý60<U+2009>mg/day), but not low-dose nifedipine (&lt;60<U+2009>mg/day) or amlodipine (any-dose), was associated with higher OHCA risk than non-use of dihydropyridines [Netherlands: adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) 1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.02-2.07), Denmark: 1.96 (1.18-3.25)] or use of amlodipine [Netherlands: 2.31 (1.54-3.47), Denmark: 2.20 (1.32-3.67)]. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest risk of (high-dose) nifedipine use was not further increased in patients using nitrates, or with a history of ischaemic heart disease. Nifedipine and amlodipine blocked L-type calcium channels at similar concentrations, but, at clinically used concentrations, nifedipine caused more L-type calcium current block, resulting in more action potential shortening.CONCLUSION: High-dose nifedipine, but not low-dose nifedipine or any-dose amlodipine, is associated with increased OHCA risk in the general population. Careful titration of nifedipine dose should be considered.","European heart journal. Cardiovascular pharmacotherapy","31504369",2019,"England"

In particular, concomitant changes in inter-beat interval and duration of repolarization were calculated after reduction and/or augmentation of specific ion channel conductances as a surrogate for pharmacological manipulation. The observed mismatches between calculations and experimental data indicate that there is information missing about the cellular test system. Based on our results we hypothesize that, among other currents, the actual If (&quot;funny current&quot;) may deviate from the prediction. We show that replacement of the If formulation by alternative equations causes the model predictions to change qualitatively, however, none of the available formulations is actually achieving a satisfactory match with experimental data. We suggest a strategy to clarify whether the mismatch can be completely resolved at all using single cell models and, if yes, how this goal could be reached.","PloS one","31498812",2019,"United States"

In this study, the biochemical changes to endothelial cells exposed to LPS were investigated by synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy at a single-cell level. We found that the whole infrared spectrum of endothelial cells shifted after LPS treatment, indicating chemical component changes within cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) and t tests on subspectra (fatty acid region, protein region, and nucleic acid-sugar region, respectively) further showed that sugar components as well as fatty acids changed dramatically while proteins had no significant variation following LPS exposure. These results suggested that the glycocalyx layer structure on endothelial cell membrane may be mainly influenced by LPS and also proved that synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy was a useful technique to evaluate the biochemical changes of endothelial damage at the single-cell level.

"Effects of age-dependent changes in cell size on endothelial cell proliferation and senescence through YAP1.","Angiogenesis - the growth of new blood capillaries- is impaired in aging animals. Biophysical factors such as changes in cell size control endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and differentiation. However, the effects of aging on EC size and the mechanism by which changes in cell size control age-dependent decline in EC proliferation are largely unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that aged ECs are larger than young ECs and that age-dependent increases in EC size control EC proliferation and senescence through CDC42-Yes-associated protein (YAP1) signaling. Reduction of aged EC size by culturing on single-cell sized fibronectin-coated smaller islands decreases CDC42 activity, stimulates YAP1 nuclear translocation and attenuates EC senescence. Stimulation of YAP1 or inhibition of CDC42 activity in aged ECs also restores blood vessel formation. Age-dependent changes in EC size and/or CDC42 and YAP1 activity may be the key control point of age-related decline in angiogenesis.","Aging","31487690",2019,"United States"
"Heterogeneity of Adult Cardiac Stem Cells.","Cardiac biology and heart regeneration have been intensively investigated and debated in the last 15<U+00A0>years. Nowadays, the well-established and old dogma that the adult heart lacks of any myocyte-regenerative capacity has been firmly overturned by the evidence of cardiomyocyte renewal throughout the mammalian life as part of normal organ cell homeostasis, which is increased in response to injury. Concurrently, reproducible evidences from independent laboratories have convincingly shown that the adult heart possesses a pool of multipotent cardiac stem/progenitor cells (CSCs or CPCs) capable of sustaining cardiomyocyte and vascular tissue refreshment after injury. CSC transplantation in animal models displays an effective regenerative potential and may be helpful to treat chronic heart failure (CHF), obviating at the poor/modest results using non-cardiac cells in clinical trials. Nevertheless, the degree/significance of cardiomyocyte turnover in the adult heart, which is insufficient to regenerate extensive damage from ischemic and non-ischemic origin, remains strongly disputed. Concurrently, different methodologies used to detect CSCs in situ have created the paradox of the adult heart harboring more than seven different cardiac progenitor populations. The latter was likely secondary to the intrinsic heterogeneity of any regenerative cell agent in an adult tissue but also to the confusion created by the heterogeneity of the cell population identified by a single cell marker used to detect the CSCs in situ. On the other hand, some recent studies using genetic fate mapping strategies claimed that CSCs are an irrelevant endogenous source of new cardiomyocytes in the adult. On the basis of these contradictory findings, here we critically reviewed the available data on adult CSC biology and their role in myocardial cell homeostasis and repair.","Advances in experimental medicine and biology","31487023",2019,"United States"

We demonstrate that single-cell itChIP-seq (sc-itChIP-seq) yields ~9,000 unique reads per cell. Using sc-itChIP-seq to profile H3K27ac, we sufficiently capture the earliest epigenetic priming event during the cell fate transition from naive to primed pluripotency, and reveal the basis for cell-type specific enhancer usage during the differentiation of bipotent cardiac progenitor cells into endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes.

"Model of Anisotropic Reverse Cardiac Growth in Mechanical Dyssynchrony.","Based on recent single-cell experiments showing that longitudinal myocyte stretch produces both parallel and serial addition of sarcomeres, we developed an anisotropic growth constitutive model with elastic myofiber stretch as the growth stimuli to simulate long-term changes in biventricular geometry associated with alterations in cardiac electromechanics. The constitutive model is developed based on the volumetric growth framework. In the model, local growth evolutions of the myocyte's longitudinal and transverse directions are driven by the deviations of maximum elastic myofiber stretch over a cardiac cycle from its corresponding local homeostatic set point, but with different sensitivities. Local homeostatic set point is determined from a simulation with normal activation pattern. The growth constitutive model is coupled to an electromechanics model and calibrated based on both global and local ventricular geometrical changes associated with chronic left ventricular free wall pacing found in previous animal experiments. We show that the coupled electromechanics-growth model can quantitatively reproduce the following: (1) Thinning and thickening of the ventricular wall respectively at early and late activated regions and (2) Global left ventricular dilation as measured in experiments. These findings reinforce the role of elastic myofiber stretch as a growth stimulant at both cellular level and tissue-level.","Scientific reports","31481725",2019,"United States"

Consistent with the observed plasticity of cardiomyocytes during cardiac regeneration, cardiomyocytes in 3D scaffolds appeared to dedifferentiate, showing an initial loss of normal cytoskeleton organization in the adaptive response to the new scaffold microenvironment. Cardiomyocytes undergoing this process regained their proliferation potential and gradually developed into myocardial cells at different developmental stages, generating heterogeneous regenerative ECTs. To better characterize the remodeled ECTs, high-throughput single-cell sequencing was performed. The ECTs contained a wide diversity of cells related to endogenous classes in the heart, including myocardial cells at different developmental stages and different kinds of interstitial cells. Non-cardiac cells seemed to play important roles in cardiac reconstruction, especially Cajal-like interstitial cells and macrophages. Altogether, our results showed for the first time that cells underwent adaptive dedifferentiation for survival in a 3D scaffold microenvironment to generate heterogeneous tissues. These findings provide an important basis for an improved understanding of the development and assembly of engineered tissues.","Biomaterials science","31455969",2019,"England"
"A thrombomodulin-like gene is crucial to the collective migration of epibolic blastomeres during germ layer formation and organogenesis in zebrafish.","BACKGROUND: Thrombomodulin (TM), an integral membrane protein, has long been known for its anticoagulant activity. Recent studies showed that TM displays multifaceted activities, including the involvement in cell adhesion and collective cell migration in vitro. However, whether TM contributes similarly to these biological processes in vivo remains elusive.METHODS: We adapted zebrafish, a prominent animal model for studying molecular/cellular activity, embryonic development, diseases mechanism and drug discovery, to examine how TM functions in modulating cell migration during germ layer formation, a normal and crucial physiological process involving massive cell movement in the very early stages of life. In addition, an in vivo assay was developed to examine the anti-hemostatic activity of TM in zebrafish larva.RESULTS: We found that zebrafish TM-b, a zebrafish TM-like protein, was expressed mainly in vasculatures and displayed anti-hemostatic activity. Knocking-down TM-b led to malformation of multiple organs, including vessels, heart, blood cells and neural tissues. Delayed epiboly and incoherent movement of yolk syncytial layer were also observed in early TM-b morphants. Whole mount immunostaining revealed the co-localization of TM-b with both actin and microtubules in epibolic blastomeres. Single-cell tracking revealed impeded migration of blastomeres during epiboly in TM-b-deficient embryos.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that TM-b is crucial to the collective migration of blastomeres during germ layer formation. The structural and functional compatibility and conservation between zebrafish TM-b and mammalian TM support the properness of using zebrafish as an in vivo platform for studying the biological significance and medical use of TM.","Journal of biomedical science","31451113",2019,"England"
"Rapid Characterization of hERG Channel Kinetics I: Using an Automated High-Throughput System.","Predicting how pharmaceuticals may affect heart rhythm is a crucial step in drug development and requires a deep understanding of a compound's action on ion channels. In<U+00A0>vitro hERG channel current recordings are an important step in evaluating the proarrhythmic potential of small molecules and are now routinely performed using automated high-throughput patch-clamp platforms. These machines can execute traditional voltage-clamp protocols aimed at specific gating processes, but the array of protocols needed to fully characterize a current is typically too long to be applied in a single cell. Shorter high-information protocols have recently been introduced that have this capability, but they are not typically compatible with high-throughput platforms. We present a new 15<U+00A0>second protocol to characterize hERG (Kv11.1) kinetics, suitable for both manual and<U+00A0>high-throughput systems. We demonstrate its use on the Nanion SyncroPatch 384PE, a 384-well automated patch-clamp platform, by applying it to Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing hERG1a. From these recordings, we construct 124 cell-specific variants/parameterizations of a hERG model at 25¡ãC. A further eight independent protocols are run in each cell and are used to validate the model predictions. We then combine the experimental recordings using a hierarchical Bayesian model, which we use to quantify the uncertainty in the model parameters, and their variability from cell-to-cell; we use this model to suggest reasons for the variability. This study demonstrates a robust method to measure and quantify uncertainty and shows that it is possible and practical to use high-throughput systems to capture full hERG channel kinetics quantitatively and rapidly.","Biophysical journal","31447109",2019,"United Kingdom"

"A Layer-by-Layer Single-Cell Coating Technique To Produce Injectable Beating Mini Heart Tissues via Microfluidics.","Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used as an alternative for human embryonic stem cells. Cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs are employed in cardiac tissue regeneration constructs due to the heart's low regeneration capacity after infarction. A coculture of hiPSC-CM and primary dermal fibroblasts is encapsulated in injectable poly(ethylene glycol)-based microgels via microfluidics to enhance the efficiency of regenerative cell transplantations. The microgels are prepared via Michael-type addition of multi-arm PEG-based molecules with an enzymatically degradable peptide as a cross-linker and modified with a cell-adhesive peptide. Cell-cell interactions and, consequently, cell viability are improved by a thin extracellular matrix (ECM) coating formed on the cell surfaces via layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition. The beating strength of encapsulated cardiomyocytes (¡«60 BPM) increases by 2-fold compared to noncoated cells. The combination of microfluidics with the LbL technique offers a new technology to fabricate functional cardiac mini tissues for cell transplantation therapies.","Biomacromolecules","31433624",2019,"United States"
"Mapping histone modifications in low cell number and single cells using antibody-guided chromatin tagmentation (ACT-seq).","Modern next-generation sequencing-based methods have empowered researchers to assay the epigenetic states of individual cells. Existing techniques for profiling epigenetic marks in single cells often require the use and optimization of time-intensive procedures such as drop fluidics, chromatin fragmentation, and end repair. Here we describe ACT-seq, a streamlined method for mapping genome-wide distributions of histone tail modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-binding proteins in a small number of or single cells. ACT-seq utilizes a fusion of Tn5 transposase to Protein A that is targeted to chromatin by a specific antibody, allowing chromatin fragmentation and sequence tag insertion specifically at genomic sites presenting the relevant antigen. The Tn5 transposase enables the use of an index multiplexing strategy (iACT-seq), which enables construction of thousands of single-cell libraries in one day by a single researcher without the need for drop-based fluidics or visual sorting. We conclude that ACT-seq present an attractive alternative to existing techniques for mapping epigenetic marks in single cells.","Nature communications","31431618",2019,"England"
"Genetic variants in TRPM7 associated with unexplained stillbirth modify ion channel function.","INTRODUCTION: Stillbirth is the loss of a foetus after 22 weeks of gestation, of which almost half go completely unexplained despite post-mortem. We recently sequenced 35 arrhythmia-associated genes from 70 unexplained stillbirth cases. Our hypothesis was that deleterious mutations in channelopathy genes may have a functional effect in utero that may be pro-arrhythmic in the developing foetus. We observed four heterozygous, nonsynonymous variants in TRPM7, a ubiquitously expressed ion channel known to regulate cardiac development and repolarisation in mice.METHODS: We used site-directed mutagenesis and single-cell patch-clamp to analyse the functional effect of the four stillbirth mutants on TRPM7 ion channel function in heterologous cells. We also used cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells to model the contribution of TRPM7 to action potential morphology.RESULTS: Our results show that two TRPM7 variants, p.G179V and p.T860M lead to a marked reduction in ion channel conductance. This observation was underpinned by a lack of measurable TRPM7 protein expression, which in the case of p.T860M was due to rapid proteasomal degradation. We also report that human hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes possess measurable TRPM7 currents, however siRNA knockdown did not directly affect action potential morphology.CONCLUSION: TRPM7 variants found in the unexplained stillbirth population adversely affect ion channel function and this may precipitate fatal arrhythmia in utero.","Human molecular genetics","31423533",2019,"United Kingdom"

"Graft-Versus-Host Disease-Free Antitumoral Signature After Allogeneic Donor Lymphocyte Injection Identified by Proteomics and Systems Biology.","PURPOSE: As a tumor immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with subsequent donor lymphocyte injection (DLI) aims to induce the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect but often also leads to acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Plasma tests that can predict the likelihood of GVT without GVHD are still needed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We first used an intact-protein analysis system to profile the plasma proteome post-DLI of patients who experienced GVT and acute GVHD for comparison with the proteome of patients who experienced GVT without GVHD in a training set. Our novel six-step systems biology analysis involved removing common proteins and GVHD-specific proteins, creating a protein-protein interaction network, calculating relevance and penalty scores, and visualizing candidate biomarkers in gene networks. We then performed a second proteomics experiment in a validation set of patients who experienced GVT without acute GVHD after DLI for comparison with the proteome of patients before DLI. We next combined the two experiments to define a biologically relevant signature of GVT without GVHD. An independent experiment with single-cell profiling in tumor antigen-activated T cells from a patient with post-hematopoietic cell transplantation relapse was performed.RESULTS: The approach provided a list of 46 proteins in the training set, and 30 proteins in the validation set were associated with GVT without GVHD. The combination of the two experiments defined a unique 61-protein signature of GVT without GVHD. Finally, the single-cell profiling in activated T cells found 43 of the 61 genes. Novel markers, such as RPL23, ILF2, CD58, and CRTAM, were identified and could be extended to other antitumoral responses.CONCLUSION: Our multiomic analysis provides, to our knowledge, the first human plasma signature for GVT without GVHD. Risk stratification on the basis of this signature would allow for customized treatment plans.","JCO precision oncology","31406955",2019,"United States"

"Mono- and multi-nucleated ventricular cardiomyocytes constitute a transcriptionally homogenous cell population.","Individual adult ventricular cardiomyocytes are either mono- or multi-nucleated and undergo morphological changes during cardiac hypertrophy. However, corresponding transcriptional signatures, reflecting potentially different functions or the ability for cell-cycle entry, are not known. The aim of this study was to determine the transcriptional profile of mono- and multi-nucleated adult cardiomyocytes by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and to investigate heterogeneity among cardiomyocytes under baseline conditions and in pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy. We developed an array-based approach for scRNA-seq of rod-shaped multi-nucleated cardiomyocytes from both healthy and hypertrophic hearts. Single-cell transcriptomes of mono- or multi-nucleated cardiomyocytes were highly similar, although a certain degree of variation was noted across both populations. Non-image-based quality control allowing inclusion of damaged cardiomyocytes generated artificial cell clusters demonstrating the need for strict exclusion criteria. In contrast, cardiomyocytes isolated from hypertrophic heart after transverse aortic constriction showed heterogeneous transcriptional signatures, characteristic for hypoxia-induced responses. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an inverse correlation between HIF1¦Á<sup>+</sup> cells and CD31-stained vessels, suggesting that imbalanced vascular growth in the hypertrophied heart induces cellular heterogeneity. Our study demonstrates that individual mono- and multi-nucleated cardiomyocytes express nearly identical sets of genes. Homogeneity among cardiomyocytes was lost after induction of hypertrophy due to differential HIF1¦Á-dependent responses most likely caused by none-homogenous vessel growth.","Basic research in cardiology","31399804",2019,"Germany"
"Arrhythmia mechanisms and spontaneous calcium release: Bi-directional coupling between re-entrant and focal excitation.","Spontaneous sub-cellular calcium release events (SCRE) are conjectured to promote rapid arrhythmias associated with conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation: they can underlie the emergence of spontaneous action potentials in single cells which can lead to arrhythmogenic triggers in tissue. The multi-scale mechanisms of the development of SCRE into arrhythmia triggers, and their dynamic interaction with the tissue substrate, remain elusive; rigorous and simultaneous study of dynamics from the nanometre to the centimetre scale is a major challenge. The aim of this study was to develop a computational approach to overcome this challenge and study potential bi-directional coupling between sub-cellular and tissue-scale arrhythmia phenomena. A framework comprising a hierarchy of computational models was developed, which includes detailed single-cell models describing spatio-temporal calcium dynamics in 3D, efficient non-spatial cell models, and both idealised and realistic tissue models. A phenomenological approach was implemented to reproduce SCRE morphology and variability in the efficient cell models, comprising the definition of analytical Spontaneous Release Functions (SRF) whose parameters may be randomly sampled from appropriate distributions in order to match either the 3D cell models or experimental data. Pro-arrhythmogenic pacing protocols were applied to initiate re-entry and promote calcium overload, leading to the emergence of SCRE. The SRF accurately reproduced the dynamics of SCRE and its dependence on environment variables under multiple different conditions. Sustained re-entrant excitation promoted calcium overload, and led to the emergence of focal excitations after termination. A purely functional mechanism of re-entry and focal activity localisation was demonstrated, related to the unexcited spiral wave core. In conclusion, a novel approach has been developed to dynamically model SCRE at the tissue scale, which facilitates novel, detailed multi-scale mechanistic analysis. It was revealed that complex re-entrant excitation patterns and SCRE may be bi-directionally coupled, promoting novel mechanisms of arrhythmia perpetuation.","PLoS computational biology","31393876",2019,"United Kingdom"
"New Insights into Bioactive Compounds of Traditional Chinese Medicines for Insulin Resistance Based on Signaling Pathways.","Type 2 diabetes is a serious metabolic disease as a long-term threat to human health. Insulin resistance is not only the basis and major feature of type 2 diabetes, but also the main etiology of diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease. It has been shown that Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) play an important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, through attenuating insulin resistance, whereas the mechanism involved is not yet well understood. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of these bioactive compounds so that one can pave the way for the modernization of TCMs. In this review, we focus on the recent progresses of some bioactive ingredients from TCMs with different functional groups, which exhibit therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetic insulin resistance. It is expected that this review can provide new references for developing TCM-derived drugs against diabetes and insulin resistance in the future.","Chemistry &amp; biodiversity","31368177",2019,"Switzerland"
"Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the Developing Cardiac Outflow Tract Reveals Convergent Development of the Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.","Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) is a major hotspot for congenital heart diseases. A thorough understanding of the cellular diversity, transitions, and regulatory networks of normal OFT development is essential to decipher the etiology of OFT malformations. We performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 55,611 mouse OFT cells from three developmental stages that generally correspond to the early, middle, and late stages of OFT remodeling and septation. Known cellular transitions, such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, have been recapitulated. In particular, we identified convergent development of the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) lineage where intermediate cell subpopulations were found to be involved in either myocardial-to-VSMC trans-differentiation or mesenchymal-to-VSMC transition. Finally, we uncovered transcriptional regulators potentially governing cellular transitions. Our study provides a single-cell reference map of cell states for normal OFT development and paves the way for further studies of the etiology of OFT malformations at the single-cell level.","Cell reports","31365875",2019,"United States"
"The transcription factor TCF-1 enforces commitment to the innate lymphoid cell lineage.","Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play important functions in immunity and tissue homeostasis, but their development is poorly understood. Through the use of single-cell approaches, we examined the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of ILC progenitors, and studied the precursor-product relationships that link the subsets identified. This analysis identified two successive stages of ILC development within T cell factor 1-positive (TCF-1<sup>+</sup>) early innate lymphoid progenitors (EILPs), which we named 'specified EILPs' and 'committed EILPs'. Specified EILPs generated dendritic cells, whereas this potential was greatly decreased in committed EILPs. TCF-1 was dispensable for the generation of specified EILPs, but required for the generation of committed EILPs. TCF-1 used a pre-existing regulatory landscape established in upstream lymphoid precursors to bind chromatin in EILPs. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms by which TCF-1 promotes developmental progression of ILC precursors, while constraining their dendritic cell lineage potential and enforcing commitment to ILC fate.","Nature immunology","31358996",2019,"United States"
"Heterogeneity and plasticity in healthy and atherosclerotic vasculature explored by single-cell sequencing.","Cellular characteristics and their adjustment to a state of disease have become more evident due to recent advances in imaging, fluorescent reporter mice, and whole genome RNA sequencing. The uncovered cellular heterogeneity and/or plasticity potentially complicates experimental studies and clinical applications, as markers derived from whole tissue 'bulk' sequencing is unable to yield a subtype transcriptome and specific markers. Here, we propose definitions on heterogeneity and plasticity, discuss current knowledge thereof in the vasculature and how this may be improved by single-cell sequencing (SCS). SCS is emerging as an emerging technique, enabling researchers to investigate different cell populations in more depth than ever before. Cell selection methods, e.g. flow assisted cell sorting, and the quantity of cells can influence the choice of SCS method. Smart-Seq2 offers sequencing of the complete mRNA molecule on a low quantity of cells, while Drop-seq is possible on large numbers of cells on a more superficial level. SCS has given more insight in heterogeneity in healthy vasculature, where it revealed that zonation is crucial in gene expression profiles among the anatomical axis. In diseased vasculature, this heterogeneity seems even more prominent with discovery of new immune subsets in atherosclerosis as proof. Vascular smooth muscle cells and mesenchymal cells also share these plastic characteristics with the ability to up-regulate markers linked to stem cells, such as Sca-1 or CD34. Current SCS studies show some limitations to the number of replicates, quantity of cells used, or the loss of spatial information. Bioinformatical tools could give some more insight in current datasets, making use of pseudo-time analysis or RNA velocity to investigate cell differentiation or polarization. In this review, we discuss the use of SCS in unravelling heterogeneity in the vasculature, its current limitations and promising future applications.","Cardiovascular research","31350876",2019,"England"
"Cyborg Organoids: Implantation of Nanoelectronics via Organogenesis for Tissue-Wide Electrophysiology.","Tissue-wide electrophysiology with single-cell and millisecond spatiotemporal resolution is critical for heart and brain studies. Issues arise, however, from the invasive, localized implantation of electronics that destroys well-connected cellular networks within matured organs. Here, we report the creation of cyborg organoids: the three-dimensional (3D) assembly of soft, stretchable mesh nanoelectronics across the entire organoid by the cell-cell attraction forces from 2D-to-3D tissue reconfiguration during organogenesis. We demonstrate that stretchable mesh nanoelectronics can migrate with and grow into the initial 2D cell layers to form the 3D organoid structure with minimal impact on tissue growth and differentiation. The intimate contact between the dispersed nanoelectronics and cells enables us to chronically and systematically observe the evolution, propagation, and synchronization of the bursting dynamics in human cardiac organoids through their entire organogenesis.","Nano letters","31347851",2019,"United States"

"Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Diversity.","Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) play a critical role in controlling blood pressure and blood distribution, as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessel. SMC also participate in physiological and pathological vascular remodeling due to their remarkable ability to dynamically modulate their phenotype. During the past decade, the development of in vivo fate mapping systems for unbiased identification and tracking of SMC and their progeny has led to major discoveries as well as the reevaluation of well-established concepts about the contribution of vascular SMC in major vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Lineage tracing studies revealed that SMC undergoes multiple phenotypic transitions characterized by the expression of markers of alternative cell types (eg, macrophage-like and mesenchymal-stem cell-like) and populate injured or diseased vessels by oligoclonal expansion of a limited number of medial SMC. With the development of high-throughput transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), the field is moving forward towards in-depth SMC phenotypic characterization. Herein, we review the major observations put forth by lineage and clonality tracing studies and the evidence in support for SMC phenotypic diversity in healthy and diseased vascular tissue. We will also discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges of combining lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics technologies, as well as studying the functional relevance of SMC phenotypic transitions and identifying the mechanisms controlling them.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","31340668",2019,"United States"

"Constitutive Activation of the B Cell Receptor Underlies Dysfunctional Signaling in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.","In cancer biology, the functional interpretation of genomic alterations is critical to achieve the promise of genomic profiling in the clinic. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a heterogeneous disease of B-lymphocytes maturing under constitutive B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, the functional role of diverse clonal mutations remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that alterations in BCR signaling dynamics underlie the progression of B cells toward malignancy. We reveal emergent dynamic features-bimodality, hypersensitivity, and hysteresis-in the BCR signaling pathway of primary CLL B cells. These signaling abnormalities in CLL quantitatively derive from BCR clustering and constitutive signaling with positive feedback reinforcement, as demonstrated through single-cell analysis of phospho-responses, computational modeling, and super-resolution imaging. Such dysregulated signaling segregates CLL patients by disease severity and clinical presentation. These findings provide a quantitative framework and methodology to assess complex and heterogeneous leukemia pathology and to inform therapeutic strategies in parallel with genomic profiling.","Cell reports","31340154",2019,"United States"

Although FVIII inhibitors have been extensively studied, much of the basic mechanism of this immune response remains to be uncovered.AIM: Within the NHLBI State of the Science Workshop on Factor VIII Inhibitors, Working Group 3 identified three scientific priorities for basic and translational research on FVIII inhibitor formation.METHODS: A larger list of potential areas of research was initially developed as a basis for subsequent prioritization. Each scientific goal was further evaluated based on required effort, potential impact, approach, methods, technologies and models.RESULTS: The three priorities include the following: activation signals and immune regulation that shape the response to FVIII (including innate immunity, microbiome, adaptive immunity and regulatory T cell studies in humans); utility of animal models and non-animal approaches (in silico, genetic, single-cell/sorted population &quot;omics,&quot; in vitro) to help predict inhibitor formation and identify novel therapeutics; and impact of the source of FVIII, its structure and von Willebrand factor on immunogenicity and tolerance.CONCLUSIONS: Early interactions between FVIII and the immune system, biomarker development and studies in different patient groups (previously treated or untreated, with or without inhibitor formation, patients undergoing immune tolerance induction or gene therapy) deserve particular emphasis. Finally, linking basic to clinical studies, development of a repository for biospecimens and opportunities for interdisciplinary research training are important components to solving the urgent problem of inhibitor formation.","Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia","31329368",2019,"England"
"Spatiotemporal Gene Coexpression and Regulation in Mouse Cardiomyocytes of Early Cardiac Morphogenesis.","Background Heart tube looping to form a 4-chambered heart is a critical stage of embryonic heart development, but the gene drivers and their regulatory targets have not been extensively characterized at the cell-type level. Methods and Results To study the interaction of signaling pathways, transcription factors (TFs), and genetic networks in the process, we constructed gene co-expression networks and identified gene modules highly activated in individual cardiomyocytes at multiple anatomical regions and developmental stages using previously published single-cell RNA-seq data. Function analyses of the modules uncovered major pathways important for spatiotemporal cardiomyocyte differentiation. Interestingly, about half of the pathways were highly active in cardiomyocytes at the outflow tract (OFT) and atrioventricular canal, including well-known pathways for cardiac development and many newly identified ones. We predicted that these OFT-atrioventricular canal pathways were regulated by a large number of TFs actively expressed at the OFT-atrioventricular canal cardiomyocytes, with the prediction supported by motif enrichment analysis, including 10 TFs that have not been previously associated with cardiac development (eg, Etv5, Rbpms, and Baz2b). Furthermore, we found that TF targets in the OFT-atrioventricular canal modules were most significantly enriched with genes associated with mouse heart developmental abnormalities and human congenital heart defects, in comparison with TF targets in other modules, consistent with the critical developmental roles of OFT. Conclusions By analyzing gene co-expression at single cardiomyocytes, our systematic study has uncovered many known and additional new important TFs and their regulated molecular signaling pathways that are spatiotemporally active during heart looping.","Journal of the American Heart Association","31322043",2019,"England"

"Activation of PDGF pathway links LMNA mutation to dilated cardiomyopathy.","Lamin A/C (LMNA) is one of the most frequently mutated genes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM related to mutations in LMNA is a common inherited cardiomyopathy that is associated with systolic dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias. Here we modelled the LMNA-related DCM in vitro using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Electrophysiological studies showed that the mutant iPSC-CMs displayed aberrant calcium homeostasis that led to arrhythmias at the single-cell level. Mechanistically, we show that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling pathway is activated in mutant iPSC-CMs compared to isogenic control iPSC-CMs. Conversely, pharmacological and molecular inhibition of the PDGF signalling pathway ameliorated the arrhythmic phenotypes of mutant iPSC-CMs in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that the activation of the PDGF pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of LMNA-related DCM and point to PDGF receptor-¦Â (PDGFRB) as a potential therapeutic target.","Nature","31316208",2019,"United States"
"Allele-Specific Silencing Ameliorates Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Attributable to a Human Myosin Regulatory Light Chain Mutation.","BACKGROUND: Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare heart disease associated with mutations in sarcomeric genes and with phenotypic overlap with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There is no approved therapy directed at the underlying cause. Here, we explore the potential of an interfering RNA (RNAi) therapeutic for a human sarcomeric mutation in MYL2 causative of restrictive cardiomyopathy in a mouse model.METHODS: A short hairpin RNA (M7.8L) was selected from a pool for specificity and efficacy. Two groups of myosin regulatory light chain N47K transgenic mice were injected with M7.8L packaged in adeno-associated virus 9 at 3 days of age and 60 days of age. Mice were subjected to treadmill exercise and echocardiography after treatment to determine maximal oxygen uptake and left ventricular mass. At the end of treatment, heart, lung, liver, and kidney tissue was harvested to determine viral tropism and for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Cardiomyocytes were isolated for single-cell studies.RESULTS: A one-time injection of AAV9-M7.8L RNAi in 3-day-old humanized regulatory light chain mutant transgenic mice silenced the mutated allele (RLC-47K) with minimal effects on the normal allele (RLC-47N) assayed at 16 weeks postinjection. AAV9-M7.8L RNAi suppressed the expression of hypertrophic biomarkers, reduced heart weight, and attenuated a pathological increase in left ventricular mass. Single adult cardiac myocytes from mice treated with AAV9-M7.8L showed partial restoration of contraction, relaxation, and calcium kinetics. In addition, cardiac stress protein biomarkers, such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the transcription activator Brg1 were reduced, suggesting recovery toward a healthy myocardium. Transcriptome analyses further revealed no significant changes of argonaute (AGO1, AGO2) and endoribonuclease dicer (DICER1) transcripts, and endogenous microRNAs were preserved, suggesting that the RNAi pathway was not saturated.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of RNAi therapeutics directed towards human restrictive cardiomyopathy. This is a promising step toward targeted therapy for a prevalent human disease.","Circulation","31315475",2019,"United States"

We developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte-based platform to study the tissue-level properties of engineered human myocardium. We investigated pathogenic mechanisms in CPVT by combining this novel platform with genome editing.CONCLUSIONS: Our study illuminates the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of CPVT and reveals a critical role of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent reentry in the tissue-scale mechanism of this disease. We anticipate that this approach will be useful for modeling other inherited and acquired cardiac arrhythmias.","Circulation","31311300",2019,"United States"

"Alterations in Polyamine Metabolism in Patients With Lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2-Deficient Cells.","BACKGROUND: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease that affects primarily women, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, leading to hyperactivation of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Rapamycin (sirolimus) treatment suppresses mTORC1 but also induces autophagy, which promotes the survival of TSC2-deficient cells. Based on the hypothesis that simultaneous inhibition of mTORC1 and autophagy would limit the availability of critical nutrients and inhibit LAM cells, we conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine for LAM. Here, we report the analyses of plasma metabolomic profiles from the clinical trial.METHODS: We analyzed the plasma metabolome in samples obtained before, during, and after 6<U+00A0>months of treatment with sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine, using univariate statistical models and machine learning approaches. Metabolites and metabolic pathways were validated in TSC2-deficient cells derived from patients with LAM. Single-cell RNA-Seq was employed to assess metabolic enzymes in an early-passage culture from an LAM lung.RESULTS: Metabolomic profiling revealed changes in polyamine metabolism during treatment, with 5'-methylthioadenosine and arginine among the most highly upregulated metabolites. Similar findings were observed in TSC2-deficient cells derived from patients with LAM. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of primary LAM cultured cells revealed that mTORC1 inhibition upregulated key enzymes in the polyamine metabolism pathway, including adenosylmethionine decarboxylase<U+00A0>1.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that polyamine metabolic pathways are targeted by the combination of rapamycin and hydroxychloroquine, leading to upregulation of 5'-methylthioadenosine and arginine in the plasma of patients with LAM and in TSC2-deficient cells derived from a patient with LAM upon treatment with this drug combination.TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT01687179; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

"Generation of Quiescent Cardiac Fibroblasts From Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for In Vitro Modeling of Cardiac Fibrosis.","RATIONALE: Activated fibroblasts are the major cell type that secretes excessive extracellular matrix in response to injury, contributing to pathological fibrosis and leading to organ failure. Effective anti-fibrotic therapeutic solutions, however, are not available due to the poorly defined characteristics and unavailability of tissue-specific fibroblasts. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing fill such gaps of knowledge by enabling delineation of the developmental trajectories and identification of regulatory pathways of tissue-specific fibroblasts among different organs.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to define the transcriptome profiles of tissue-specific fibroblasts using recently reported mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas and to develop a robust chemically defined protocol to derive cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells for in vitro modeling of cardiac fibrosis and drug screening.METHODS AND RESULTS: By analyzing the single-cell transcriptome profiles of fibroblasts from 10 selected mouse tissues, we identified distinct tissue-specific signature genes, including transcription factors that define the identities of fibroblasts in the heart, lungs, trachea, and bladder. We also determined that CFs in large are of the epicardial lineage. We thus developed a robust chemically defined protocol that generates CFs from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Functional studies confirmed that iPSC-derived CFs preserved a quiescent phenotype and highly resembled primary CFs at the transcriptional, cellular, and functional levels. We demonstrated that this cell-based platform is sensitive to both pro- and anti-fibrosis drugs. Finally, we showed that crosstalk between human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and CFs via the atrial/brain natriuretic peptide-natriuretic peptide receptor-1 pathway is implicated in suppressing fibrogenesis.CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers unique gene signatures that define tissue-specific identities of fibroblasts. The bona fide quiescent CFs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells can serve as a faithful in vitro platform to better understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiac fibrosis and to screen anti-fibrotic drugs.","Circulation research","31288631",2019,"United States"
"Using cell sheets to regenerate mouse submandibular glands.","Temperature-responsive polymer grafted tissue culture dishes release cells as confluent living sheets in response to small changes in temperature, with recovered cell sheets retaining cell-cell communications, functional extracellular matrices and tissue-like behaviors. These features promote tissue regeneration and improve transplantation efficacy in various tissues including cartilage, heart, kidney, liver, endometrium, cornea, middle ear, periodontium, and esophageal living sheet transplants. However, the functional effects of cell sheets for salivary gland regeneration to treat hyposalivation have not yet been studied. Thus, the present study aims to both establish the viability of thermoresponsive cell sheets for use in salivary glands and then explore the delivery option (i.e., single vs. multiple layers) that would result in the most complete tissue growth in terms of cell differentiation and recovered tissue integrity. Results indicate that single cell sheets form polarized structures that maintain cell-cell junctions and secretory granules in vitro while layering of two-single cell sheets forms a glandular-like pattern in vitro. Moreover, double layer cell sheets enhance tissue formation, cell differentiation and saliva secretion in vivo. In contrast, single cell sheets demonstrated only modest gains relative to the robust growth seen with the double layer variety. Together, these data verify the utility of thermoresponsive cell sheets for use in salivary glands and indicates the double layer form to provide the best option in terms of cell differentiation and recovered tissue integrity, thereby offering a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating hyposalivation.","NPJ Regenerative medicine","31285850",2019,"United States"

"Transcriptomic Profiling of the Developing Cardiac Conduction System at Single-Cell Resolution.","RATIONALE: The cardiac conduction system (CCS) consists of distinct components including the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. Despite an essential role for the CCS in heart development and function, the CCS has remained challenging to interrogate because of inherent obstacles including small cell numbers, large cell-type heterogeneity, complex anatomy, and difficulty in isolation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows for genome-wide analysis of gene expression at single-cell resolution.OBJECTIVE: Assess the transcriptional landscape of the entire CCS at single-cell resolution by single-cell RNA-sequencing within the developing mouse heart.METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type, embryonic day 16.5 mouse hearts (n=6 per zone) were harvested and 3 zones of microdissection were isolated, including: Zone I-sinoatrial node region; Zone II-atrioventricular node/His region; and Zone III-bundle branch/Purkinje fiber region. Tissue was digested into single-cell suspensions, cells isolated, mRNA reverse transcribed, and barcoded before high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on over 22<U+2009>000 cells, and all major cell types of the murine heart were successfully captured including bona fide clusters of cells consistent with each major component of the CCS. Unsupervised weighted gene coexpression network analysis led to the discovery of a host of novel CCS genes, a subset of which were validated using fluorescent in situ hybridization as well as whole-mount immunolabeling with volume imaging (iDISCO+) in 3 dimensions on intact mouse hearts. Further, subcluster analysis unveiled isolation of distinct CCS cell subtypes, including the clinically relevant but poorly characterized transitional cells that bridge the CCS and surrounding myocardium.CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first comprehensive assessment of the transcriptional profiles from the entire CCS at single-cell resolution and provides a characterization in the context of development and disease.","Circulation research","31284824",2019,"United States"
"Etv2 transcriptionally regulates Yes1 and promotes cell proliferation during embryogenesis.","Etv2, an Ets-transcription factor, governs the specification of the earliest hemato-endothelial progenitors during embryogenesis. While the transcriptional networks during hemato-endothelial development have been well described, the mechanistic details are incompletely defined. In the present study, we described a new role for Etv2 as a regulator of cellular proliferation via Yes1 in mesodermal lineages. Analysis of an Etv2-ChIPseq dataset revealed significant enrichment of Etv2 peaks in the upstream regions of cell cycle regulatory genes relative to non-cell cycle genes. Our bulk-RNAseq analysis using the doxycycline-inducible Etv2 ES/EB system showed increased levels of cell cycle genes including E2f4 and Ccne1 as early as 6<U+2009>h following Etv2 induction. Further, EdU-incorporation studies demonstrated that the induction of Etv2 resulted in a ~2.5-fold increase in cellular proliferation, supporting a proliferative role for Etv2 during differentiation. Next, we identified Yes1 as the top-ranked candidate that was expressed in Etv2-EYFP<sup>+</sup> cells at E7.75 and E8.25 using single cell RNA-seq analysis. Doxycycline-mediated induction of Etv2 led to an increase in Yes1 transcripts in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the level of Yes1 was reduced in Etv2 null embryoid bodies. Using bioinformatics algorithms, biochemical, and molecular biology techniques, we show that Etv2 binds to the promoter region of Yes1 and functions as a direct upstream transcriptional regulator of Yes1 during embryogenesis. These studies enhance our understanding of the mechanisms whereby Etv2 governs mesodermal fate decisions early during embryogenesis.","Scientific reports","31278282",2019,"United States"

"Context-Specific Transcription Factor Functions Regulate Epigenomic and Transcriptional Dynamics during Cardiac Reprogramming.","Ectopic expression of combinations of transcription factors (TFs) can drive direct lineage conversion, thereby reprogramming a somatic cell's identity. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) induce conversion from a cardiac fibroblast toward an induced cardiomyocyte, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic, DNA-occupancy, and epigenomic interrogation throughout the reprogramming process. Integration of these datasets identified new TFs involved in cardiac reprogramming and revealed context-specific roles for GMT, including the ability of Mef2c and Tbx5 to independently promote chromatin remodeling at previously inaccessible sites. We also find evidence for cooperative facilitation and refinement of each TF's binding profile in a combinatorial setting. A reporter assay employing newly defined regulatory elements confirmed that binding of a single TF can be sufficient for gene activation, suggesting that co-binding events do not necessarily reflect synergy. These results shed light on fundamental mechanisms by which combinations of TFs direct lineage conversion.","Cell stem cell","31271750",2019,"United States"

"Mouse HSA+ immature cardiomyocytes persist in the adult heart and expand after ischemic injury.","The assessment of the regenerative capacity of the heart has been compromised by the lack of surface signatures to characterize cardiomyocytes (CMs). Here, combined multiparametric surface marker analysis with single-cell transcriptional profiling and in vivo transplantation identify the main mouse fetal cardiac populations and their progenitors (PRGs). We found that CMs at different stages of differentiation coexist during development. We identified a population of immature heat stable antigen (HSA)/ cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24)+ CMs that persists throughout life and that, unlike other CM subsets, actively proliferates up to 1 week of age and engrafts cardiac tissue upon transplantation. In the adult heart, a discrete population of HSA/CD24+ CMs appears as mononucleated cells that increase in frequency after infarction. Our work identified cell surface signatures that allow the prospective isolation of CMs at all developmental stages and the detection of a subset of immature CMs throughout life that, although at reduced frequencies, are poised for activation in response to ischemic stimuli. This work opens new perspectives in the understanding and treatment of heart pathologies.","PLoS biology","31246945",2019,"United States"
"Transcriptional dynamics of pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell differentiation revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.","AIMS: Pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell products possess therapeutic potential in ischaemic vascular disease. However, the factors that drive endothelial differentiation from pluripotency and cellular specification are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the transcriptional landscape and cellular dynamics of directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hESC-EC) and to compare these cells to mature endothelial cells from diverse vascular beds.METHODS AND RESULTS: A highly efficient directed 8-day differentiation protocol was used to generate a hESC-derived endothelial cell product (hESC-ECP), in which 66% of cells co-expressed CD31 and CD144. We observed largely homogeneous hESC and mesodermal populations at Days 0 and 4, respectively, followed by a rapid emergence of distinct endothelial and mesenchymal populations. Pseudotime trajectory identified transcriptional signatures of endothelial commitment and maturation during the differentiation process. Concordance in transcriptional signatures was verified by scRNA-seq analysis using both a second hESC line RC11, and an alternative hESC-EC differentiation protocol. In total, 105<U+00A0>727 cells were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. Global transcriptional comparison revealed a transcriptional architecture of hESC-EC that differs from freshly isolated and cultured human endothelial cells and from organ-specific endothelial cells.CONCLUSION: A transcriptional bifurcation into endothelial and mesenchymal lineages was identified, as well as novel transcriptional signatures underpinning commitment and maturation. The transcriptional architecture of hESC-ECP was distinct from mature and foetal human EC.","European heart journal","31242503",2019,"United Kingdom"

"Single-cell imaging and transcriptomic analyses of endogenous cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and cycling.","While it is recognized that there are low levels of new cardiomyocyte (CM) formation throughout life, the source of these new CM generates much debate. One hypothesis is that these new CMs arise from the proliferation of existing CMs potentially after dedifferentiation although direct evidence for this is lacking. Here we explore the mechanisms responsible for CM renewal in vivo using multi-reporter transgenic mouse models featuring efficient adult CM (ACM) genetic cell fate mapping and real-time cardiomyocyte lineage and dedifferentiation reporting. Our results demonstrate that non-myocytes (e.g., cardiac progenitor cells) contribute negligibly to new ACM formation at baseline or after cardiac injury. In contrast, we found a significant increase in dedifferentiated, cycling CMs in post-infarct hearts. ACM cell cycling was enhanced within the dedifferentiated CM population. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that CMs identified with dedifferentiation reporters had significant down-regulation in gene networks for cardiac hypertrophy, contractile, and electrical function, with shifts in metabolic pathways, but up-regulation in signaling pathways and gene sets for active cell cycle, proliferation, and cell survival. The results demonstrate that dedifferentiation may be an important prerequisite for CM proliferation and explain the limited but measurable cardiac myogenesis seen after myocardial infarction (MI).","Cell discovery","31231540",2019,"United States"
"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses of Cell Fate Transitions during Human Cardiac Reprogramming.","Direct cellular reprogramming provides a powerful platform to study cell plasticity and dissect mechanisms underlying cell fate determination.

These analyses revealed hiCM reprogramming-specific features and a decision point at which cells either embark on reprogramming or regress toward their original fibroblast state. In combination with functional screening, we found that immune-response-associated DNA methylation is required for hiCM induction and validated several downstream targets of reprogramming factors as necessary for productive hiCM reprograming. Collectively, this single-cell transcriptomics study provides detailed datasets that reveal molecular features underlying hiCM determination and rigorous analytical pipelines for predicting cell fate conversion.","Cell stem cell","31230860",2019,"United States"
"Copy number variations in individuals with conotruncal heart defects reveal some shared developmental pathways irrespective of 22q11.2 deletion status.","Over 50% of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) have a conotruncal or related cardiac defect (CTRD). We hypothesized that similar genetic variants, developmental pathways and biological functions, contribute to disease risk for CTRD in patients without a 22q11.2 deletion (ND-CTRD) and with a 22q11.2 deletion (DS-CTRD). To test this hypothesis, we performed rare CNV (rCNV)-based analyses on 630 ND-CTRD cases and 602 DS-CTRD cases with comparable cardiac lesions separately and jointly. First, we detected a collection of heart development related pathways from Gene Ontology and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology analysis. We then constructed gene regulation networks using unique genes collected from the rCNVs found in the ND-CTRD and DS-CTRD cohorts. These gene networks were clustered and their predicted functions were examined. We further investigated expression patterns of those unique genes using publicly available mouse embryo microarray expression data from single-cell embryos to fully developed hearts. By these bioinformatics approaches, we identified a commonly shared gene expression pattern in both the ND-CTRD and DS-CTRD cohorts. Computational analysis of gene functions characterized with this expression pattern revealed a collection of significantly enriched terms related to cardiovascular development. By our combined analysis of rCNVs in the ND-CTRD and DS-CTRD cohorts, a group of statistically significant shared pathways, biological functions, and gene expression patterns were identified that can be tested in future studies for their biological relevance.","Birth defects research","31222980",2019,"United States"
"Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Chemotaxis-Mediated Intraorgan Crosstalk During Cardiogenesis.","RATIONALE: We hypothesized that the differentiation processes of cardiac progenitor cell (CP) from first and second heart fields (FHF and SHF) may undergo the unique instructive gene regulatory networks or signaling pathways, and the precise SHF progression is contingent on the FHF signaling developmental cues.OBJECTIVE: We investigated how the intraorgan communications control sequential building of discrete anatomic regions of the heart at single-cell resolution.METHODS AND RESULTS: By single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Nkx2-5 (NK2 homeobox 5) and Isl1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) lineages at embryonic day 7.75, embryonic day 8.25, embryonic day 8.75, and embryonic day 9.25, we present a panoramic view of distinct CP differentiation hierarchies. Computational identifications of FHF- and SHF-CP descendants revealed that SHF differentiation toward cardiomyocytes underwent numerous step-like transitions, whereas earlier FHF progressed toward cardiomyocytes in a wave-like manner. Importantly, single-cell pairing analysis demonstrated that SHF-CPs were attracted to and expanded FHF-populated heart tube region through interlineage communications mediated by the chemotactic guidance (MIF [macrophage migration inhibitory factor]-CXCR2 [C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2]). This finding was verified by pharmacological blockade of this chemotaxis in embryos manifesting limited SHF cell migration and contribution to the growth of the outflow tract and right ventricle but undetectable effects on the left ventricle or heart tube initiation. Genetic loss-of-function assay of Cxcr2 showed that the expression domain of CXCR4 was expanded predominantly at SHF. Furthermore, double knockout of Cxcr2/Cxcr4 exhibited defective SHF development, corroborating the redundant function. Mechanistically, NKX2-5 directly bound the Cxcr2 and Cxcr4 genomic loci and activated their transcription in SHF.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we propose a model in which the chemotaxis-mediated intraorgan crosstalk spatiotemporally guides the successive process of positioning SHF-CP and promoting primary heart expansion and patterning upon FHF-derived heart tube initiation.","Circulation research","31221018",2019,"United States"
"Modelling diastolic dysfunction in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.","AIMS: Diastolic dysfunction (DD) is common among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, causing major morbidity and mortality. However, its cellular mechanisms are not fully understood, and presently there is no effective treatment. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) hold great potential for investigating the mechanisms underlying DD in HCM and as a platform for drug discovery.METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, beating iPSC-CMs were generated from healthy controls and HCM patients with DD. Micropatterned iPSC-CMs from HCM patients showed impaired diastolic function, as evidenced by prolonged relaxation time, decreased relaxation rate, and shortened diastolic sarcomere length. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging indicated elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i and abnormal Ca2+ handling in HCM iPSC-CMs, which were exacerbated by ¦Â-adrenergic challenge. Combining Ca2+ imaging and traction force microscopy, we observed enhanced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (measured as dF/¦¤[Ca2+]i) in HCM iPSC-CMs. These results were confirmed with genome-edited isogenic iPSC lines that carry HCM mutations, indicating that cytosolic diastolic Ca2+ overload, slowed [Ca2+]i recycling, and increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, collectively impairing the relaxation of HCM iPSC-CMs. Treatment with partial blockade of Ca2+ or late Na+ current reset diastolic Ca2+ homeostasis, restored diastolic function, and improved long-term survival, suggesting that disturbed Ca2+ signalling is an important cellular pathological mechanism of DD. Further investigation showed increased expression of L-type Ca2+channel (LTCC) and transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPC) in HCM iPSC-CMs compared with control iPSC-CMs, which likely contributed to diastolic [Ca2+]i overload.CONCLUSION: In summary, this study recapitulated DD in HCM at the single-cell level, and revealed novel cellular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of DD using iPSC-CMs.","European heart journal","31219556",2019,"United States"
"Rational Reprogramming of Cellular States by Combinatorial Perturbation.","Ectopic expression of transcription factors (TFs) can reprogram cell state. However, because of the large combinatorial space of possible TF cocktails, it remains difficult to identify TFs that reprogram specific cell types. Here, we develop Reprogram-Seq to experimentally screen thousands of TF cocktails for reprogramming performance. Reprogram-Seq leverages organ-specific cell-atlas data with single-cell perturbation and computational analysis to predict, evaluate, and optimize TF combinations that reprogram a cell type of interest. Focusing on the cardiac system, we perform Reprogram-Seq on MEFs using an undirected library of 48 cardiac factors and, separately, a directed library of 10 epicardial-related TFs. We identify a combination of three TFs, which efficiently reprogram MEFs to epicardial-like cells that are transcriptionally, molecularly, morphologically, and functionally similar to primary epicardial cells.

"Why pacing frequency affects the production of early afterdepolarizations in cardiomyocytes: An explanation revealed by slow-fast analysis of a minimal model.","Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological voltage oscillations in cardiomyocytes that have been observed in response to a number of pharmacological agents and disease conditions. Phase-2 EADs consist of small voltage fluctuations during the plateau of an action potential, typically under conditions in which the action potential is elongated. Although a single-cell behavior, EADs can lead to tissue-level arrhythmias. Much is currently known about the biophysical mechanisms (i.e., the roles of ion channels and intracellular Ca^{2+} stores) for the various forms of EADs, due partially to the development and analysis of mathematical models. This includes the application of slow-fast analysis, which takes advantage of timescale separation inherent in the system to simplify its analysis. We take this further, using a minimal three-dimensional model to demonstrate that phase-2 EADs are canards formed in the neighborhood of a folded node singularity. This allows us to predict the number of EADs that can be produced for a given parameter set, and provides guidance on parameter changes that facilitate or inhibit EAD production. With this approach, we demonstrate why periodic stimulation, as occurs in intact heart, preferentially facilitates EAD production when applied at low frequencies. We also explain the origin of complex alternan dynamics that can occur with intermediate-frequency stimulation, in which varying numbers of EADs are produced with each pulse. These revelations fall out naturally from an understanding of folded node singularities, but are difficult to glean from knowledge of the biophysical mechanism for EADs alone. Therefore, understanding the canard mechanism is a useful complement to understanding of the biophysical mechanism that has been developed over years of experimental and computational investigations.","Physical review.

"DECENT: differential expression with capture efficiency adjustmeNT for single-cell RNA-seq data.","MOTIVATION: Dropout is a common phenomenon in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, and when left unaddressed it affects the validity of the statistical analyses. Despite this, few current methods for differential expression (DE) analysis of scRNA-seq data explicitly model the process that gives rise to the dropout events. We develop DECENT, a method for DE analysis of scRNA-seq data that explicitly and accurately models the molecule capture process in scRNA-seq experiments.RESULTS: We show that DECENT demonstrates improved DE performance over existing DE methods that do not explicitly model dropout. This improvement is consistently observed across several public scRNA-seq datasets generated using different technological platforms. The gain in improvement is especially large when the capture process is overdispersed. DECENT maintains type I error well while achieving better sensitivity. Its performance without spike-ins is almost as good as when spike-ins are used to calibrate the capture model.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is implemented as a publicly available R package available from https://github.com/cz-ye/DECENT.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","31197307",2019,"England"

Furthermore, we highlight viral-based delivery tools that have been widely used to evaluate the therapeutic utility of both coding and non-coding RNAs in the context of cardiovascular disease. Finally, we discuss the potential of using oligonucleotide-based molecular products such as modified RNA, small interfering RNA and RNA mimics/inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Given that many non-coding RNAs have not yet been functionally annotated, the number of potential RNA diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases will continue to expand for years to come.","Nature reviews.

"Single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal novel targets modulating cardiac neovascularization by resident endothelial cells following myocardial infarction.","AIMS: A better understanding of the pathways that regulate regeneration of the coronary vasculature is of fundamental importance for the advancement of strategies to treat patients with heart disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the origin and clonal dynamics of endothelial cells (ECs) associated with neovascularization in the adult mouse heart following myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, we sought to define murine cardiac endothelial heterogeneity and to characterize the transcriptional profiles of pro-angiogenic resident ECs in the adult mouse heart, at single-cell resolution.METHODS AND RESULTS: An EC-specific multispectral lineage-tracing mouse (Pdgfb-iCreERT2-R26R-Brainbow2.1) was used to demonstrate that structural integrity of adult cardiac endothelium following MI was maintained through clonal proliferation by resident ECs in the infarct border region, without significant contributions from bone marrow cells or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Ten transcriptionally discrete heterogeneous EC states, as well as the pathways through which each endothelial state is likely to enhance neovasculogenesis and tissue regeneration following ischaemic injury were defined. Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (Plvap) was selected for further study, which showed an endothelial-specific and increased expression in both the ischaemic mouse and human heart, and played a direct role in regulating human endothelial proliferation in vitro.CONCLUSION: We present a single-cell gene expression atlas of cardiac specific resident ECs, and the transcriptional hierarchy underpinning endogenous vascular repair following MI.

"A single-cell transcriptional roadmap for cardiopharyngeal fate diversification.","In vertebrates, multipotent progenitors located in the pharyngeal mesoderm form cardiomyocytes and branchiomeric head muscles, but the dynamic gene expression programmes and mechanisms underlying cardiopharyngeal multipotency and heart versus head muscle fate choices remain elusive. Here, we used single-cell genomics in the simple chordate model Ciona to reconstruct developmental trajectories forming first and second heart lineages and pharyngeal muscle precursors and characterize the molecular underpinnings of cardiopharyngeal fate choices. We show that FGF-MAPK signalling maintains multipotency and promotes the pharyngeal muscle fate, whereas signal termination permits the deployment of a pan-cardiac programme, shared by the first and second heart lineages, to define heart identity. In the second heart lineage, a Tbx1/10-Dach pathway actively suppresses the first heart lineage programme, conditioning later cell diversity in the beating heart. Finally, cross-species comparisons between Ciona and the mouse evoke the deep evolutionary origins of cardiopharyngeal networks in chordates.","Nature cell biology","31160712",2019,"England"

"Single cell expression analysis reveals anatomical and cell cycle-dependent transcriptional shifts during heart development.","The heart is a complex organ composed of multiple cell and tissue types. Cardiac cells from different regions of the growing embryonic heart exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression, which are thought to contribute to heart development and morphogenesis. Single cell RNA sequencing allows genome-wide analysis of gene expression at the single cell level. Here, we have analyzed cardiac cells derived from early stage developing hearts by single cell RNA-seq and identified cell cycle gene expression as a major determinant of transcriptional variation. Within cell cycle stage-matched CMs from a given heart chamber, we found that CMs in the G2/M phase downregulated sarcomeric and cytoskeletal markers. We also identified cell location-specific signaling molecules that may influence the proliferation of other nearby cell types. Our data highlight how variations in cell cycle activity selectively promote cardiac chamber growth during development, reveal profound chamber-specific cell cycle-linked transcriptional shifts, and open the way to deeper understanding of pathogenesis of congenital heart disease.","Development (Cambridge, England)","31142541",2019,"United States"

"Single cell analysis of the developing mouse kidney provides deeper insight into marker gene expression and ligand-receptor crosstalk.","Recent advances in the generation of kidney organoids and the culture of primary nephron progenitors from mouse and human have been based on knowledge of the molecular basis of kidney development in mice. Although gene expression during kidney development has been intensely investigated, single cell profiling provides new opportunities to further subsect component cell types and the signalling networks at play. Here, we describe the generation and analysis of 6732 single cell transcriptomes from the fetal mouse kidney [embryonic day (E)18.5] and 7853 sorted nephron progenitor cells (E14.5). These datasets provide improved resolution of cell types and specific markers, including subdivision of the renal stroma and heterogeneity within the nephron progenitor population. Ligand-receptor interaction and pathway analysis reveals novel crosstalk between cellular compartments and associates new pathways with differentiation of nephron and ureteric epithelium cell types.

"RRAD mutation causes electrical and cytoskeletal defects in cardiomyocytes derived from a familial case of Brugada syndrome.","AIMS: The Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac disorder predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias. Despite considerable efforts, its genetic basis and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to identify a new susceptibility gene for BrS through familial investigation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing performed in a three-generation pedigree with five affected members allowed the identification of one rare non-synonymous substitution (p.R211H) in RRAD, the gene encoding the RAD GTPase, carried by all affected members of the family. Three additional rare missense variants were found in 3/186 unrelated index cases. We detected higher levels of RRAD transcripts in subepicardium than in subendocardium in human heart, and in the right ventricle outflow tract compared to the other cardiac compartments in mice. The p.R211H variant was then subjected to electrophysiological and structural investigations in human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs). Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from two affected family members exhibited reduced action potential upstroke velocity, prolonged action potentials and increased incidence of early afterdepolarizations, with decreased Na+ peak current amplitude and increased Na+ persistent current amplitude, as well as abnormal distribution of actin and less focal adhesions, compared with intra-familial control iPSC-CMs Insertion of p.R211H-RRAD variant in control iPSCs by genome editing confirmed these results. In addition, iPSC-CMs from affected patients exhibited a decreased L-type Ca2+ current amplitude.CONCLUSION: This study identified a potential new BrS-susceptibility gene, RRAD. Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells expressing RRAD variant recapitulated single-cell electrophysiological features of BrS, including altered Na+ current, as well as cytoskeleton disturbances.","European heart journal","31114854",2019,"England"
"A cellular model of Brugada syndrome with SCN10A variants using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.","AIMS: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is associated with a pronounced risk to develop sudden cardiac death (SCD). Up to 21% of patients are related to mutations in SCN5A. Studies identified SCN10A as a contributor of BrS. However, the investigation of the human cellular phenotype of BrS in the presence of SCN10A mutations remains lacking. The objective of this study was to establish a cellular model of BrS in presence of SCN10A mutations using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).METHODS AND RESULTS: Dermal fibroblasts obtained from a BrS patient suffering from SCD harbouring the SCN10A double variants (c.3803G&gt;A and c.3749G&gt;A) and three independent healthy control subjects were reprogrammed to hiPSCs. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).The hiPSC-CMs from the BrS patient showed a significantly reduced peak sodium channel current (INa) and a significantly reduced ATX II (sea anemone toxin, an enhancer of late INa) sensitive as well as A-887826 (a blocker of SCN10A channel) sensitive late sodium channel current (INa) when compared with the healthy control hiPSC-CMs, indicating loss-of-function of sodium channels. Consistent with reduced INa the action potential amplitude and upstroke velocity (Vmax) were significantly reduced, which may contribute to arrhythmogenesis of BrS. Moreover, Ajmaline effects on action potentials were stronger in BrS-hiPSC-CMs than in healthy control cells. This is in agreement with the higher susceptibility of patients to sodium channel blocking drugs in unmasking BrS.CONCLUSION: Patient-specific hiPSC-CMs are able to recapitulate single-cell phenotype features of BrS with SCN10A mutations and may provide novel opportunities to further elucidate the cellular disease mechanism.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology","31106349",2019,"England"

"Perivascular adipose tissue-derived stromal cells contribute to vascular remodeling during aging.","Aging is an independent risk factor for vascular diseases. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), an active component of the vasculature, contributes to vascular dysfunction during aging. Identification of underlying cell types and their changes during aging may provide meaningful insights regarding the clinical relevance of aging-related vascular diseases. Here, we take advantage of single-cell RNA sequence to characterize the resident stromal cells in the PVAT (PVASCs) and identified different clusters between young and aged PVASCs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed decreased endothelial and brown adipogenic differentiation capacities of PVASCs during aging, which contributed to neointimal hyperplasia after perivascular delivery to ligated carotid arteries. Mechanistically, in vitro and in vivo studies both suggested that aging-induced loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-¦Ã coactivator-1 ¦Á (PGC1¦Á) was a key regulator of decreased brown adipogenic differentiation in senescent PVASCs. We further demonstrated the existence of human PVASCs (hPVASCs) and overexpression of PGC1¦Á improved hPVASC delivery-induced vascular remodeling. Our finding emphasizes that differentiation capacities of PVASCs alter during aging and loss of PGC1¦Á in aged PVASCs contributes to vascular remodeling via decreased brown adipogenic differentiation.","Aging cell","31087498",2019,"International"
"Comprehensive Analysis of Animal Models of Cardiovascular Disease using Multiscale X-Ray Phase Contrast Tomography.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) affect the myocardium and vasculature, inducing remodelling of the heart from cellular to whole organ level. To assess their impact at micro and macroscopic level, multi-resolution imaging techniques that provide high quality images without sample alteration and in 3D are necessary: requirements not fulfilled by most of current methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the non-destructive time-efficient 3D multiscale capabilities of synchrotron Propagation-based X-Ray Phase Contrast Imaging (PB-X-PCI) to study a wide range of cardiac tissue characteristics in one healthy and three different diseased rat models. With a dedicated image processing pipeline, PB-X-PCI images are analysed in order to show its capability to assess different cardiac tissue components at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The presented technique evaluates in detail the overall cardiac morphology, myocyte aggregate orientation, vasculature changes, fibrosis formation and nearly single cell arrangement. Our results agree with conventional histology and literature. This study demonstrates that synchrotron PB-X-PCI, combined with image processing tools, is a powerful technique for multi-resolution structural investigation of the heart ex-vivo. Therefore, the proposed approach can improve the understanding of the multiscale remodelling processes occurring in CVDs, and the comprehensive and fast assessment of future interventional approaches.","Scientific reports","31061429",2019,"England"
"Optical and photoacoustic radiofrequency spectroscopic analysis for detecting red blood cell death.","Under stress, red blood cells (RBCs) undergo programmed cell death (eryptosis). One of the signaling molecules for eryptosis, sphingomyelinase (SMase), plays an important role in monitoring the efficacy of vascular targeted cancer therapy. The high optical absorption of erythrocytes coupled with the changes of eryptotic RBCs makes RBCs ideal targets for the photoacoustic (PA) detection and characterization of vascular treatments. In this work, experiments characterizing eryptosis were performed: PA detection of high frequencies (&gt;100<U+2009>MHz) that enabled analysis at the single-cell level and of low frequencies (21<U+2009>MHz) that enabled analysis at the RBC ensemble level. Ultrasound spectral analysis was performed on control and SMase-treated RBCs. Spectral unmixing was applied to quantify methemoglobin production as a by-product of RBC death. Validation was performed using a blood gas analyzer and optical spectrometry. Our results indicate that PA radiofrequency spectra could be used to differentiate the biochemically induced morphological changes as RBCs lose their native biconcave shape, and release hemoglobin into the surroundings. Spectral unmixing revealed a 7% increase in methemoglobin content for SMase-treated samples due to the oxidative stress on the RBCs. These findings suggest that PA spectral analysis of RBC death can potentially serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of vascular targeted cancer therapies.","Journal of biophotonics","31050867",2019,"Germany"

"Human pre-valvular endocardial cells derived from pluripotent stem cells recapitulate cardiac pathophysiological valvulogenesis.","Genetically modified mice have advanced our understanding of valve development and disease. Yet, human pathophysiological valvulogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we report that, by combining single cell sequencing and in vivo approaches, a population of human pre-valvular endocardial cells (HPVCs) can be derived from pluripotent stem cells. HPVCs express gene patterns conforming to the E9.0 mouse atrio-ventricular canal (AVC) endocardium signature. HPVCs treated with BMP2, cultured on mouse AVC cushions, or transplanted into the AVC of embryonic mouse hearts, undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and express markers of valve interstitial cells of different valvular layers, demonstrating cell specificity. Extending this model to patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells recapitulates features of mitral valve prolapse and identified dysregulation of the SHH pathway. Concurrently increased ECM secretion can be rescued by SHH inhibition, thus providing a putative therapeutic target. In summary, we report a human cell model of valvulogenesis that faithfully recapitulates valve disease in a dish.","Nature communications","31028265",2019,"United States"

"The Efficacy and Safety of Sendai Viral Reprograming of Mouse Primary Cells Using Human Vectors.","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) remain a promising approach to target diseases with a loss of functional parenchyma. This technology comes with a number of concerns for clinical applications, including teratogenic potential and genomic instability. Here we focused on evaluating the safety of cross-species Sendai viral reprogramming, as well as investigating the transcriptional dynamics during reprogramming and differentiation. We established that Sendai viral vectors carrying human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) could produce mouse iPSCs free of transduced viral materials. Gene expression analysis revealed an efficient silencing of the virally-introduced human pluripotency factors and upregulation of the endogenous pluripotency network over time. In addition, single cell gene expression analysis of proof-of-principle-derived cardiomyocytes revealed distinct expression patterns indicative of subspecialized cardiac cell lineages. Moreover, our results demonstrate the importance of monitoring genomic aberrations before any clinical or preclinical applications, as we detected a high prevalence of chromosomal instability. Taken together, we demonstrated the successful use of a clinically germane method to reprogram terminally differentiated mouse cells and their potential to generate specialized cardiac cell types. Additionally, our results suggest a plasticity of OSKM to reprogram more divergent species and provide a new application of an established reprogramming approach.","Cellular reprogramming","30969880",2019,"United States"
"Feasibility of using adjunctive optogenetic technologies in cardiomyocyte phenotyping - from the single cell to the whole heart .","In 1791 Galvani established that electricity activated excitable cells. In the two centuries that followed, electrode stimulation of neuronal, skeletal and cardiac muscle became the adjunctive method of choice in experimental, electrophysiological, and clinical arenas. This approach underpins breakthrough technologies like implantable cardiac pacemakers that we currently take for granted. However, the contact dependence, and field stimulation that electrical depolarization delivers brings inherent limitations to the scope and experimental scale that can be achieved. Many of these were not exposed until reliable in vitro stem-cell derived experimental material, with genotypes of interest, were produced in the numbers needed for multi-well screening platforms (for toxicity or efficacy studies) or the 2D or 3D tissue surrogates required to study propagation of depolarization within multicellular constructs that mimic clinically relevant arrhythmia in the heart or brain. Here the limitations of classical electrode stimulation are discussed. We describe how these are overcome by optogenetic tools which put electrically excitable cells under the control of light. We discuss how this enables studies in cardiac material from the single cell to the whole heart scale. We review the current commercial platforms that incorporate optogenetic stimulation strategies, and summarize the global literature to date on cardiac applications of optogenetics. We show that the advantages of optogenetic stimulation relevant to iPS-CM based screening include independence from contact, elimination of electrical stimulation artefacts in field potential measuring approaches such as the multi-electrode array, and the ability to print re-entrant patterns of depolarization at will on 2D cardiomyocyte monolayers.","Current pharmaceutical biotechnology","30961485",2019,"Netherlands"

Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can improve skin and organ fibrosis in patients with progressive disease and a high risk of organ failure, indicating that cells originating in the bone marrow are important contributors to the pathogenesis of SSc. Animal studies also indicate a pivotal function of myeloid cells in the development of fibrosis leading to changes in the tissue architecture and dysfunction in multiple organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidney. In this Review, we summarize current knowledge about the function of myeloid cells in fibrogenesis that occurs in patients with SSc. Targeted therapies currently in clinical studies for SSc might affect myeloid cell-related pathways. Therefore, myeloid cells might be used as cellular biomarkers of disease through the application of high-dimensional techniques such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing.","Nature reviews.

"Drug Testing in Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes From a Patient With Short QT Syndrome Type 1.","Short QT syndrome (SQTS) predisposes afflicted patients to sudden cardiac death. Until now, only one drug-quinidine-has been shown to be effective in patients with SQTS type 1(SQTS1). The objective of this study was to use human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from a patient with SQTS1 to search for potentially effective drugs for the treatment of SQTS1 patients. Patch clamp and single-cell contraction measurements were employed to assess drug effects. Ivabradine, mexiletine, and ajmaline but not flecainide, ranolazine, or amiodarone prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in hiPSC-CMs from an SQTS1 patient. Ivabradine, ajmaline, and mexiletine inhibited KCNH2 channel currents significantly, which may underlie their APD-prolonging effects. Under proarrhythmic epinephrine stimulation in spontaneously beating SQTS1 hiPSC-CMs, ivabradine, mexiletine, and ajmaline but not flecainide reduced the epinephrine-induced arrhythmic events. The results demonstrate that ivabradine, ajmaline, and mexiletine may be candidate drugs for preventing tachyarrhythmias in SQTS1 patients.","Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","30947366",2019,"United States"
"Adventitial Cell Atlas of wt (Wild Type) and ApoE (Apolipoprotein E)-Deficient Mice Defined by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.","Objective- Vascular adventitia encompasses progenitors and is getting recognized as the major site of inflammation in early stage of atherosclerosis. However, the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous adventitial cells, the intercellular communication, the cellular response of adventitia to hyperlipidemia, and its contribution to atherosclerosis have been elusive. Approach and Results- Single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to wt (wild type) and ApoE (apolipoprotein E)-deficient aortic adventitia from 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice fed on normal laboratory diet with early stage of atherosclerosis. Unbiased clustering analysis revealed that the landscape of adventitial cells encompassed adventitial mesenchyme cells, immune cells (macrophages, T cells, and B cells), and some types of rare cells, for example, neuron, lymphatic endothelial cells, and innate lymphoid cells. Seurat clustering analysis singled out 6 nonimmune clusters with distinct transcriptomic profiles, in which there predominantly were stem/progenitor cell-like and proinflammatory population (Mesen II). In ApoE-deficient adventitia, resident macrophages were activated and related to increased myeloid cell infiltration in the adventitia. Cell communication analysis further elucidated enhanced interaction between a mesenchyme cluster and inflammatory macrophages in ApoE-deficient adventitia. In vitro transwell assay confirmed the proinflammatory role of SCA1<sup>+</sup> (stem cell antigen 1 positive) Mesen II population with increased CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) secretion and thus increased capacity to attract immune cells in ApoE-deficient adventitia. Conclusions- Cell atlas defined by single-cell RNA sequencing depicted the heterogeneous cellular landscape of the adventitia and uncovered several types of cell populations. Furthermore, resident cell interaction with immune cells appears crucial at the early stage of atherosclerosis.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","30943771",2019,"United Kingdom"

There are no methods for the reproducible generation of clinical-quality stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). We identified laminin-221 (LN-221) as the most likely expressed cardiac laminin. We produced it as human recombinant protein and showed that LN-221 promotes differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward cardiomyocyte lineage and downregulates pluripotency and teratoma-associated genes. We developed a chemically defined, xeno-free laminin-based differentiation protocol to generate CVPs. We show high reproducibility of the differentiation protocol using time-course bulk RNA sequencing developed from different hESC lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CVPs derived from hESC lines supported reproducibility and identified three main progenitor subpopulations. These CVPs were transplanted into myocardial infarction mice, where heart function was measured by echocardiogram and human heart muscle bundle formation was identified histologically. This method may provide clinical-quality cells for use in regenerative cardiology.","Cell reports","30893597",2019,"United States"

"Quantitative Analysis of Cellular Composition in Advanced Atherosclerotic Lesions of Smooth Muscle Cell Lineage-Tracing Mice.","Atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of death worldwide and, despite countless preclinical studies describing promising therapeutic targets, novel interventions have remained elusive. This is likely due, in part, to a reliance on preclinical prevention models investigating the effects of genetic manipulations or pharmacological treatments on atherosclerosis development rather than the established disease. Also, results of these studies are often confounding because of the use of superficial lesion analyses and a lack of characterization of lesion cell populations. To help overcome these translational hurdles, we propose an increased reliance on intervention models that employ investigation of changes in cellular composition at a single cell level by immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy. To this end, we describe a protocol for testing a putative therapeutic agent in a murine intervention model including a systematic approach for animal dissection, embedding, sectioning, staining, and quantification of brachiocephalic artery lesions. In addition, due to the phenotypic diversity of cells within late-stage atherosclerotic lesions, we describe the importance of using cell-specific, inducible lineage tracing mouse systems and how this can be leveraged for unbiased characterization of atherosclerotic lesion cell populations. Together, these strategies may assist vascular biologists to more accurately model therapeutic interventions and analyze atherosclerotic disease and will hopefully translate into a higher rate of success in clinical trials.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","30855565",2019,"United States"
"Endothelial miR-30c suppresses tumor growth via inhibition of TGF-¦Â-induced Serpine1.","In tumors, extravascular fibrin forms provisional scaffolds for endothelial cell (EC) growth and motility during angiogenesis. We report that fibrin-mediated angiogenesis was inhibited and tumor growth delayed following postnatal deletion of Tgfbr2 in the endothelium of Cdh5-CreERT2 Tgfbr2fl/fl mice (Tgfbr2iECKO mice). ECs from Tgfbr2iECKO mice failed to upregulate the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (Serpine1, also known as PAI-1), due in part to uncoupled TGF-¦Â-mediated suppression of miR-30c. Bypassing TGF-¦Â signaling with vascular tropic nanoparticles that deliver miR-30c antagomiRs promoted PAI-1-dependent tumor growth and increased fibrin abundance, whereas miR-30c mimics inhibited tumor growth and promoted vascular-directed fibrinolysis in vivo. Using single-cell RNA-Seq and a NanoString miRNA array, we also found that subtypes of ECs in tumors showed spectrums of Serpine1 and miR-30c expression levels, suggesting functional diversity in ECs at the level of individual cells; indeed, fresh EC isolates from lung and mammary tumor models had differential abilities to degrade fibrin and launch new vessel sprouts, a finding that was linked to their inverse expression patterns of miR-30c and Serpine1 (i.e., miR-30chi Serpine1lo ECs were poorly angiogenic and miR-30clo Serpine1hi ECs were highly angiogenic). Thus, by balancing Serpine1 expression in ECs downstream of TGF-¦Â, miR-30c functions as a tumor suppressor in the tumor microenvironment through its ability to promote fibrin degradation and inhibit blood vessel formation.","The Journal of clinical investigation","30855280",2019,"United States"

"Microinjection-based System for In Vivo Implantation of Embryonic Cardiomyocytes in the Avian Embryo.","Interpreting the relative impact of cell autonomous patterning versus extrinsic microenvironmental influence on cell lineage determination represents a general challenge in developmental biology research. In the embryonic heart, this can be particularly difficult as regional differences in the expression of transcriptional regulators, paracrine/juxtacrine signaling cues, and hemodynamic force are all known to influence cardiomyocyte maturation. A simplified method to alter a developing cardiomyocyte's molecular and biomechanical microenvironment would, therefore, serve as a powerful technique to examine how local conditions influence cell fate and function. To address this, we have optimized a method to physically transplant juvenile cardiomyocytes into ectopic locations in the heart or the surrounding embryonic tissue. This allows us to examine how microenvironmental conditions influence cardiomyocyte fate transitions at single cell resolution within the intact embryo. Here, we describe a protocol in which embryonic myocytes can be isolated from a variety of cardiac sub-domains, dissociated, fluorescently labeled, and microinjected into host embryos with high precision. Cells can then be directly analyzed in situ using a variety of imaging and histological techniques. This protocol is a powerful alternative to traditional grafting experiments that can be prohibitively difficult in a moving tissue such as the heart. The general outline of this method can also be adapted to a variety of donor tissues and host environments, and its ease of use, low cost, and speed make it a potentially useful application for a variety of developmental studies.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","30829335",2019,"United States"

"Human Cardiac-Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Like Cells, a Novel Cell Population with Therapeutic Potential.","Cardiac stem/progenitors are being used in the clinic to treat patients with a range of cardiac pathologies. However, improvements in heart function following treatment have been reported to be variable, with some showing no response. This discrepancy in response remains unresolved. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been highlighted as a regenerative tool as these cells display both immunomodulatory and proregenerative activities. The purpose of this study was to derive a cardiac MSC population to provide an alternative/support to current therapies. We derived human cardiac-mesenchymal stem cell-like cells (CMSCLC), so named as they share some MSC characteristics. However, CMSCLC lack the MSC trilineage differentiation capacity, being capable of only rare adipogenic differentiation and demonstrating low/no osteogenic or chondrogenic potential, a phenotype that may have advantages following transplantation. Furthermore, CMSCLC expressed low levels of p16, high levels of MHCI, and low levels of MHCII. A lack of senescent cells would also be advantageous for cells to be used therapeutically, as would the ability to modulate the immune response. Crucially, CMSCLC display a transcriptional profile that includes genes associated with cardioprotective/cardiobeneficial effects. CMSCLC are also secretory and multipotent, giving rise to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Our findings support CMSCLC as a novel cell population suitable for use for transplantation.","Stem cells and development","30803370",2019,"United Kingdom"
"Combination of &quot;quadratic adaptive algorithm&quot; and &quot;hybrid operator splitting&quot; or uniformization algorithms for stability against acceleration in the Markov model of sodium ion channels in the ventricular cell model.","The Markovian model has generally been used for cardiac electrophysiological simulations. However, the Markovian model is so stiff that speeding up the computation of the algorithms with variable time-steps always results in simulation instability. In particular, the unstable simulations always occur at a low voltage rate or current change, while transition rates in the Markovian model are changing markedly. The uniformization (UNI) method allows for a Markovian model simulation with high stability but also a high computation cost. To save computation costs with variable time-steps, we propose a speed increasing idea that is a compromise to the trade-off between stability and acceleration by combining Chen-Chen-Luo's &quot;quadratic adaptive algorithm&quot; (CCL) method with &quot;hybrid operator splitting&quot; (HOS) into the solver (CCL + HOS solver). The computation cost of this CCL + HOS solver is approximately 24 times lower than the CCL + UNI solver, and the CCL + HOS solver can function 295 times faster in comparison to the HOS solver with a fixed time-step (DT). The suggested optimal solver should be CCL + HOS solver with a maximum time-step at 0.1<U+00A0>ms due to its high speed with low error. Additionally, the CCL method has much better performance and stability than the hybrid method in this single-cell model simulation.","Medical &amp; biological engineering &amp; computing","30798516",2019,"United States"
"Maturation of heart valve cell populations during postnatal remodeling.","Heart valve cells mediate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling during postnatal valve leaflet stratification, but phenotypic and transcriptional diversity of valve cells in development is largely unknown. Single cell analysis of mouse heart valve cells was used to evaluate cell heterogeneity during postnatal ECM remodeling and leaflet morphogenesis. The transcriptomic analysis of single cells from postnatal day (P)7 and P30 murine aortic (AoV) and mitral (MV) heart valves uncovered distinct subsets of melanocytes, immune and endothelial cells present at P7 and P30. By contrast, interstitial cell populations are different from P7 to P30. P7 valve leaflets exhibit two distinct collagen- and glycosaminoglycan-expressing interstitial cell clusters, and prevalent ECM gene expression. At P30, four interstitial cell clusters are apparent with leaflet specificity and differential expression of complement factors, ECM proteins and osteogenic genes. This initial transcriptomic analysis of postnatal heart valves at single cell resolution demonstrates that subpopulations of endothelial and immune cells are relatively constant throughout postnatal development, but interstitial cell subpopulations undergo changes in gene expression and cellular functions in primordial and mature valves.","Development (Cambridge, England)","30796046",2019,"United States"

"Recently Discovered Interstitial Cell Population of Telocytes: Distinguishing Facts from Fiction Regarding Their Role in the Pathogenesis of Diverse Diseases Called &quot;Telocytopathies&quot;.","In recent years, the interstitial cells telocytes, formerly known as interstitial Cajal-like cells, have been described in almost all organs of the human body. Although telocytes were previously thought to be localized predominantly in the organs of the digestive system, as of 2018 they have also been described in the lymphoid tissue, skin, respiratory system, urinary system, meninges and the organs of the male and female genital tracts. Since the time of eminent German pathologist Rudolf Virchow, we have known that many pathological processes originate directly from cellular changes. Even though telocytes are not widely accepted by all scientists as an individual and morphologically and functionally distinct cell population, several articles regarding telocytes have already been published in such prestigious journals as Nature and Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. The telocyte diversity extends beyond their morphology and functions, as they have a potential role in the etiopathogenesis of different diseases. The most commonly described telocyte-associated diseases (which may be best termed &quot;telocytopathies&quot; in the future) are summarized in this critical review. It is difficult to imagine that a single cell population could be involved in the pathogenesis of such a wide spectrum of pathological conditions as extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (&quot;telocytomas&quot;), liver fibrosis, preeclampsia during pregnancy, tubal infertility, heart failure and psoriasis. In any case, future functional studies of telocytes in vivo will help to understand the mechanism by which telocytes contribute to tissue homeostasis in health and disease.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","30781716",2019,"Switzerland"
"Using Gjd3-CreEGFP mice to examine atrioventricular node morphology and composition.","The atrioventricular node (AVN) coordinates the timing of atrial and ventricular contraction to optimize cardiac performance. To study this critical function using mouse genetics, however, new reagents are needed that allow AVN-specific manipulation. Here we describe a novel Gjd3-CreEGFP mouse line that successfully recombines floxed alleles within the AVN beginning at E12.5. These mice have been engineered to express CreEGFP under the control of endogenous Gjd3 regulatory elements without perturbing native protein expression. Detailed histological analysis of Gjd3-CreEGFP mice reveals specific labeling of AVN cardiomyocytes and a subset of cardiac endothelial cells. Importantly, we show that Gjd3-CreEGFP mice have preserved cardiac mechanical and electrical function. In one application of our newly described mouse line, we provide a three-dimensional (3D) view of the AVN using tissue clearing combined with confocal microscopy. With this 3D model as a reference, we identify specific AVN sub-structures based on marker staining characteristics. In addition, we use our Gjd3-CreEGFP mice to guide microdissection of the AVN and construction of a single-cell atlas. Thus, our results establish a new transgenic tool for AVN-specific recombination, provide an updated model of AVN morphology, and describe a roadmap for exploring AVN cellular heterogeneity.","Scientific reports","30765799",2019,"United States"

"Understanding cell fate control by continuous single-cell quantification.","Cells and the molecular processes underlying their behavior are highly dynamic. Understanding these dynamic biological processes requires noninvasive continuous quantitative single-cell observations, instead of population-based average or single-cell snapshot analysis. Ideally, single-cell dynamics are measured long-term in vivo; however, despite progress in recent years, technical limitations still prevent such studies. On the other hand, in vitro studies have proven to be useful for answering long-standing questions. Although technically still demanding, long-term single-cell imaging and tracking in vitro have become valuable tools to elucidate dynamic molecular processes and mechanisms, especially in rare and heterogeneous populations. Here, we review how continuous quantitative single-cell imaging of hematopoietic cells has been used to solve decades-long controversies. Because aberrant cell fate decisions are at the heart of tissue degeneration and disease, we argue that studying their molecular dynamics using quantitative single-cell imaging will also improve our understanding of these processes and lead to new strategies for therapies.","Blood","30728141",2019,"United States"

"Focal adhesions are essential to drive zebrafish heart valve morphogenesis.","Elucidating the morphogenetic events that shape vertebrate heart valves, complex structures that prevent retrograde blood flow, is critical to understanding valvular development and aberrations. Here, we used the zebrafish atrioventricular (AV) valve to investigate these events in real time and at single-cell resolution. We report the initial events of collective migration of AV endocardial cells (ECs) into the extracellular matrix (ECM), and their subsequent rearrangements to form the leaflets. We functionally characterize integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs), critical mediators of cell-ECM interactions, during valve morphogenesis. Using transgenes to block FA signaling specifically in AV ECs as well as loss-of-function approaches, we show that FA signaling mediated by Integrin ¦Á5¦Â1 and Talin1 promotes AV EC migration and overall shaping of the valve leaflets. Altogether, our investigation reveals the critical processes driving cardiac valve morphogenesis in vivo and establishes the zebrafish AV valve as a vertebrate model to study FA-regulated tissue morphogenesis.","The Journal of cell biology","30635353",2019,"United States"
"Modelling sarcomeric cardiomyopathies with human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.","Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a unique opportunity to understand the pathophysiological effects of genetic cardiomyopathy mutations. In particular, these cells hold the potential to unmask the effects of mutations on contractile behaviour in vitro, providing new insights into genotype-phenotype relationships. With this goal in mind, several groups have established iPSC lines that contain sarcomeric gene mutations linked to cardiomyopathy in patient populations. Their studies have employed diverse systems and methods for performing mechanical measurements of contractility, ranging from single cell techniques to multicellular tissue-like constructs. Here, we review published results to date within the growing field of iPSC-based sarcomeric cardiomyopathy disease models. We devote special attention to the methods of mechanical characterization selected in each case, and how these relate to the paradigms of classical muscle mechanics. An appreciation of these somewhat subtle paradigms can inform efforts to compare the results of different studies and possibly reconcile discrepancies. Although more work remains to be done to improve and possibly standardize methods for producing, maturing, and mechanically interrogating iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, the initial results indicate that this approach to modelling cardiomyopathies will continue to provide critical insights into these devastating diseases.","The Journal of physiology","30624779",2019,"United States"

"A Supramolecular Nanocarrier for Delivery of Amiodarone Anti-Arrhythmic Therapy to the Heart.","Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic drug used to treat and prevent different types of cardiac arrhythmias. However, amiodarone can have considerable side effects resulting from accumulation in off-target tissues. Cardiac macrophages are highly prevalent tissue-resident immune cells with importance in homeostatic functions, including immune response and modulation of cardiac conduction. We hypothesized that amiodarone could be more efficiently delivered to the heart via cardiac macrophages, an important step toward reducing overall dose and off-target tissue accumulation. Toward this goal, we synthesized a nanoparticle drug carrier composed of l-lysine cross-linked succinyl-¦Â-cyclodextrin that demonstrates amiodarone binding through supramolecular host-guest interaction as well as a high macrophage affinity. Biodistribution analyses at the organ and single-cell level demonstrate accumulation of nanoparticles in the heart resulting from rapid uptake by cardiac macrophages. Nanoparticle assisted delivery of amiodarone resulted in a 250% enhancement in the selective delivery of the drug to cardiac tissue in part due to a concomitant decrease of pulmonary accumulation, the main source of off-target toxicity.","Bioconjugate chemistry","30615425",2019,"United States"

However, the study of these interplays at the molecular level remains challenging due to the lack of efficient methods allowing cell cycle synchronization of large quantities of cells. Here, we screened inhibitors of cell cycle progression and identified nocodazole as the most efficient small molecule to synchronize hPSCs in the G2/M phase. Following nocodazole treatment, hPSCs remain pluripotent, retain a normal karyotype and can successfully differentiate into the three germ layers and functional cell types. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptomic analyses on single cells synchronized for their cell cycle and differentiated toward the endoderm lineage validated our findings and showed that nocodazole treatment has no effect on gene expression during the differentiation process. Thus, our synchronization method provides a robust approach to study cell cycle mechanisms in hPSCs.","Stem cell reports","30595546",2019,"United Kingdom"
"Cardiomyocytes-Actuated Morpho Butterfly Wings.","Morpho butterflies are famous for their wings' brilliant structural colors arising from periodic nanostructures, which show great potential value for fundamental research and practical applications. Here, a novel cellular mechanical visualizable biosensor formed by assembling engineered cardiac tissues on the Morpho butterfly wings is presented. The assembled cardiomyocytes benefit from the periodic parallel nanoridges of the wings and can recover their autonomic beating ability with guided cellular orientation and good contraction performance. As the beating processes are accompanied by the cardiomyocytes' elongation and contraction, the elastic butterfly wing substrate undergoes the same cycle of deformations, which causes corresponding synchronous shifts in their structural colors and photonic bandgaps for self-reporting of the cell mechanics. It is demonstrated that this self-reporting performance can be further improved by adding oriented carbon nanotubes in the nanoridges of the wings for the culture. In addition, taking advantage of the similar size of the cardiomyocyte and a single Morpho wing scale, the investigation of single-cell-level mechanics can be realized by detecting the optical performance of a single scale. These remarkable properties make these butterfly wings ideal platforms for biomedical research.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)","30589122",2018,"Germany"

Using syngeneic cardiac transplantation to model ischemia-reperfusion injury and distinguish tissue-resident from recruited cell populations in combination with intravital 2-photon microscopy, we demonstrate that monocyte recruitment is differentially orchestrated by distinct subsets of tissue-resident cardiac macrophages.

The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed &quot;noise&quot; in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue.

Orthogonal validation of immunophenotyping using mass cytometry demonstrated a strong correlation with flow cytometry. Technical replicates using single-cell RNA sequencing matched robustly, while biological replicates showed variation. Given the increasing use of single-cell technologies in translational research, this resource serves as an important reference data set and highlights opportunities for further refinement.","JCI insight","30518681",2018,"United States"

"Single-Cell RNA-Seq of Mouse Olfactory Bulb Reveals Cellular Heterogeneity and Activity-Dependent Molecular Census of Adult-Born Neurons.","Cellular heterogeneity within the mammalian brain poses a challenge toward understanding its complex functions. Within the olfactory bulb, odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality are influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity and better understand adult-born neuron development, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and nonneuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we identified that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the olfactory bulb (OB), charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons and how they dynamically change in an activity-dependent manner.","Cell reports","30517858",2018,"United States"

"Acute Myocardial Infarction, Cardioprotection, and Muse Cells.","Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Severe MI leads to heart failure due to a marked loss of functional cardiomyocytes. First-line treatment for AMI is to reperfuse the occluded coronary artery by PCI as soon as possible. Besides PCI, there are several therapies to reduce the infarct size and improve the cardiac function and remodeling. These are drug therapies such as pharmacological pre- and postconditioning, cytokine therapies, and stem cell therapies. None of these therapies have been clinically developed as a standard treatment for AMI. Among many cell sources for stem cell therapies, the Muse cell is an endogenous non-tumorigenic pluripotent stem cell, which is able to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers from a single cell, suggesting that the Muse cell is a potential cell source for regenerative medicine. Endogenous Muse cell dynamics in the acute phase plays an important role in the prognosis of AMI patients; AMI patients with a higher number of Muse cells in the peripheral blood in the acute phase show more favorable improvement of the cardiac function and remodeling in the chronic phase, suggesting their innate reparative function for the heart. Intravenously administered exogenous Muse cells engrafted preferentially and efficiently to infarct border areas via the S1P-S1PR2 axis and differentiated spontaneously into working cardiomyocytes and vessels, showed paracrine effects, markedly reduced the myocardial infarct size, and delivered long-lasting improvement of the cardiac function and remodeling for 6<U+00A0>months. These findings suggest that Muse cells are reparative stem cells, and thus their clinical application is warranted.","Advances in experimental medicine and biology","30484228",2018,"United States"

"Defining human cardiac transcription factor hierarchies using integrated single-cell heterogeneity analysis.","Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have become a powerful tool for human disease modeling and therapeutic testing. However, their use remains limited by their immaturity and heterogeneity. To characterize the source of this heterogeneity, we applied complementary single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq technologies over time during hiPSC cardiac differentiation and in the adult heart. Using integrated transcriptomic and splicing analysis, more than half a dozen distinct single-cell populations were observed, several of which were coincident at a single time-point, day 30 of differentiation. To dissect the role of distinct cardiac transcriptional regulators associated with each cell population, we systematically tested the effect of<U+00A0>a gain or<U+00A0>loss of three transcription factors (NR2F2, TBX5, and HEY2), using CRISPR genome editing and ChIP-seq, in conjunction with patch clamp, calcium imaging, and CyTOF analysis.

"Two recombinant human monoclonal antibodies that protect against lethal Andes hantavirus infection in vivo.","Andes hantavirus (ANDV) is an etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a severe disease characterized by fever, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms that may progress to hypotension, pulmonary failure, and cardiac shock that results in a 25 to 40% case-fatality rate. Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine; however, several studies have shown that the generation of neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses strongly correlates with survival from HCPS in humans. In this study, we screened 27 ANDV convalescent HCPS patient sera for their capacity to bind and neutralize ANDV in vitro. One patient who showed high neutralizing titer was selected to isolate ANDV-glycoprotein (GP) Abs. ANDV-GP-specific memory B cells were single cell sorted, and recombinant immunoglobulin G antibodies were cloned and produced. Two monoclonal Abs (mAbs), JL16 and MIB22, potently recognized ANDV-GPs and neutralized ANDV. We examined the post-exposure efficacy of these two mAbs as a monotherapy or in combination therapy in a Syrian hamster model of ANDV-induced HCPS, and both mAbs protected 100% of animals from a lethal challenge dose. These data suggest that monotherapy with mAb JL16 or MIB22, or a cocktail of both, could be an effective post-exposure treatment for patients infected with ANDV-induced HCPS.","Science translational medicine","30463919",2018,"United States"
"Single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis of cardiac progenitor cell transition states and lineage settlement.","Formation and segregation of cell lineages forming the heart have been studied extensively but the underlying gene regulatory networks and epigenetic changes driving cell fate transitions during early cardiogenesis are still only partially understood. Here, we comprehensively characterize mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) marked by Nkx2-5 and Isl1 expression from E7.5 to E9.5 using single-cell RNA sequencing and transposase-accessible chromatin profiling (ATAC-seq). By leveraging on cell-to-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility heterogeneity, we identify different previously unknown cardiac subpopulations. Reconstruction of developmental trajectories reveal that multipotent Isl1<sup>+</sup> CPC pass through an attractor state before separating into different developmental branches, whereas extended expression of Nkx2-5 commits CPC to an unidirectional cardiomyocyte fate. Furthermore, we show that CPC fate transitions are associated with distinct open chromatin states critically depending on Isl1 and Nkx2-5. Our data provide a model of transcriptional and epigenetic regulations during cardiac progenitor cell fate decisions at single-cell resolution.","Nature communications","30451828",2018,"England"

"Comet assay and its use for evaluating oxidative DNA damage in some pathological states.","The comet assay, or single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE), is a sensitive, rapid, relatively simple and inexpensive method for detecting DNA strand breaks in individual cells. It is used in a broad variety of applications and as a tool to investigate DNA damage and repair. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay are greatly enhanced if the DNA incubated with an enzyme, which recognizes a specific kind of DNA damage. This damage induced by oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in many diseases and in aging. This article is a critical review of the possible application of the comet assay in some pathological states in clinical practice. Most of the studies relate to evaluating the response of an organism to chemotherapy or radiotherapy with statistically significant evidence of DNA damage in patients. Other useful applications have been demonstrated for patients with heart or neurodegenerative diseases. Only a few studies have been published on the use of this method in critically ill patients, although its use would be appropriate. There are also other scenarios where the comet assay could prove to be very useful in the future, such as in predicting the likelihood of certain pathological conditions.","Physiological research","30433808",2018,"Czech Republic"
"Quantifying Tissue-Specific Overexpression of FOXO in Drosophila via mRNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Using Branched DNA Probe Technology.","While<U+00A0>the highly conserved FOXO transcription factors have been studied in Drosophila melanogaster for decades, the ability to accurately control and measure their tissue-specific expression is often cumbersome due to a lack of reagents and to limited, nonhomogeneous samples. The need for quantitation within a distinct cell type is particularly important because transcription factors must be expressed in specific amounts to perform their functions properly. However, the inherent heterogeneity of many samples can make evaluating cell-specific FOXO and/or FOXO load difficult. Here, we describe an extremely sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach for visualizing and quantifying multiple mRNAs with single-cell resolution in adult Drosophila cardiomyocytes. The procedure relies upon branched DNA technology, which allows several fluorescent molecules to label an individual transcript, drastically increasing the signal-to-noise ratio compared to other FISH assays. This protocol can be modified for use in various small animal models, tissue types, and for assorted nucleic acids.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","30414154",2018,"United States"

"Disease-relevant transcriptional signatures identified in individual smooth muscle cells from healthy mouse vessels.","Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) show pronounced heterogeneity across and within vascular beds, with direct implications for their function in injury response and atherosclerosis. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics with lineage tracing to examine VSMC heterogeneity in healthy mouse vessels. The transcriptional profiles of single VSMCs consistently reflect their region-specific developmental history and show heterogeneous expression of vascular disease-associated genes involved in inflammation, adhesion and migration. We detect a rare population of VSMC-lineage cells that express the multipotent progenitor marker Sca1, progressively downregulate contractile VSMC genes and upregulate genes associated with VSMC response to inflammation and growth factors. We find that Sca1 upregulation is a hallmark of VSMCs undergoing phenotypic switching in vitro and in vivo, and reveal an equivalent population of Sca1-positive VSMC-lineage cells in atherosclerotic plaques. Together, our analyses identify disease-relevant transcriptional signatures in VSMC-lineage cells in healthy blood vessels, with implications for disease susceptibility, diagnosis and prevention.","Nature communications","30385745",2018,"International"

"Cardiomyocyte gene programs encoding morphological and functional signatures in cardiac hypertrophy and failure.","Pressure overload induces a transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure, but its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we reconstruct a trajectory of cardiomyocyte remodeling and clarify distinct cardiomyocyte gene programs encoding morphological and functional signatures in cardiac hypertrophy and failure, by integrating single-cardiomyocyte transcriptome with cell morphology, epigenomic state and heart function. During early hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes activate mitochondrial translation/metabolism genes, whose expression is correlated with cell size and linked to ERK1/2 and NRF1/2 transcriptional networks. Persistent overload leads to a bifurcation into adaptive and failing cardiomyocytes, and p53 signaling is specifically activated in late hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific p53 deletion shows that cardiomyocyte remodeling is initiated by p53-independent mitochondrial activation and morphological hypertrophy, followed by p53-dependent mitochondrial inhibition, morphological elongation, and heart failure gene program activation. Human single-cardiomyocyte analysis validates the conservation of the pathogenic transcriptional signatures. Collectively, cardiomyocyte identity is encoded in transcriptional programs that orchestrate morphological and functional phenotypes.","Nature communications","30375404",2018,"England"

"Simultaneous AFM Investigation of the Single Cardiomyocyte Electro-Chemo-Mechanics During Excitation-Contraction Coupling.","The cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is the cellular process through which the heart absolves its blood pumping function, and it is directly affected when cardiac pathologies occur. Cardiomyocytes are the functional units in which this complex biomolecular process takes place: they can be represented as a two-stage electro-chemo and chemo-mechanical transducer, along which each stage can be probed and monitored via appropriate micro/nanotechnology-based tools. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), with its unique nanoresolved force sensitivity and versatile modes of extracting sample properties, can represent a key instrument to study time-dependent heart mechanics and topography at the single cell level. In this work, we show how the integrative possibilities of AFM allowed us to implement an in vitro system which can monitor cardiac electrophysiology, intracellular calcium dynamics, and single cell mechanics. We believe this single cell-sensitive and integrated system will unlock improved, fast, and reliable cardiac in vitro tests in the future.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","30374879",2018,"United States"
"Non-invasive diagnosis of early-onset coronary artery disease based on cell type-specific gene expression analyses.","A non-invasive diagnostic method based on biomarkers related to endothelial and mononuclear cell dysfunction can provide opportunities for screening and early treatment of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to construct a risk scoring model based on clinical risk factors and molecular markers (lncRNA SENCR and CD markers) at single-cell level for early diagnosis of early-onset coronary artery disease (EOCAD). A single-cell expression analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets derived from 253 young individuals (Males ¡Ü45 and Females ¡Ü55 years old) in two training and validation sets using FISH-Flow assay. Concurrent quantifications of intracellular SENCR and surface/intracellular CD31, CD146, CD45 and CD14 in mononuclear cell fractions (Circulating endothelial cell, Monocyte and Lymphocyte) showed a significant reduction in intra-CEC SENCR, increased in intra-monocyte SENCR and also increased surface/intracellular CD146 and CD14 in patients with EOCAD as compared to the controls. Altered biomarkers were combined together as a risk scoring model. The ROC curve analysis on the combination model showed a high-performance in the distinction of our patients with EOCAD and healthy controls. A positive correlation between SENCR and CD14 in monocytes led us to find a binding site corresponding to SENCR and CD14 mRNA interaction. Our study suggested that combination of our molecular and clinical factors can be benefit to early diagnosis of EOCAD. CECs in peripheral blood as the novel approach could reflect molecular alteration in vascular endothelium. Bimodal variation in intracellular SENCR at the single-cell transcriptional level suggests that SENCR has cell-specific function(s) in its epigenetic gene regulation mechanisms.","Biomedicine &amp; pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine &amp; pharmacotherapie","30372812",2018,"France"
"FBXO17 promotes cell proliferation through activation of Akt in lung adenocarcinoma cells.","BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, mediated in part, by ubiquitin E3 ligases, is critical in regulating cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. FBXO17 was recently identified as an F-box protein that targets glycogen synthase kinase-3¦Â to the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein complex for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here, we identified that in several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, FBXO17 cellular protein was detected at relatively high levels, as was expression in a subset of lung cancers. Hence, we investigated the effects of FBXO17 on cell proliferation.METHODS: Single cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed on a resection of a non-small cell lung carcinoma tumor to examine FBXO17 expression. Multiple lung cancer cell lines were immunoblotted, and The Cancer Genome Atlas was analyzed to determine if FBXO17 expression was amplified in a subset of lung cancers. A549 cells were transfected with empty vector or FBXO17-V5 plasmid and immunoblotted for Akt pathway mediators including PDK1, ERK1/2, ribosomal protein S6, and CREB. Cell proliferation and viability were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion, BrdU incorporation and an MTS-based fluorometric assay. Studies were also performed after transfecting with sifbxo17. Samples were used in an RNA microarray analysis to evaluate pathways affected by reduced FBXO17 gene expression.RESULTS: We observed that overexpression of FBXO17 increased A549 cell proliferation coupled with Akt activation. Ectopically expressed FBXO17 also increased ERK1/2 kinase activation and increased phosphorylation of RPS6, a downstream target of mTOR. We also observed an increased number of cells in S-phase and increased metabolic activity of lung epithelial cells expressing FBXO17. FBXO17 knockdown reduced Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation approaching statistical significance with no effect on Thr 308. However, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cellular metabolic activity, and overall cell numbers were reduced. When we analyzed RNA profiles of A549 cells with reduced FBXO17 expression, we observed downregulation of several genes associated with cell proliferation and metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: These data support a role for FBXO17 abundance, when left unchecked, in regulating cell proliferation and survival through modulation of Akt and ERK kinase activation. The data raise a potential role for the F-box subunit in modulating tumorigenesis.","Respiratory research","30359271",2018,"United States"

"A comprehensive anatomical map of the peripheral octopaminergic/tyraminergic system of Drosophila melanogaster.","The modulation of an animal's behavior through external sensory stimuli, previous experience and its internal state is crucial to survive in a constantly changing environment. In most insects, octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA) modulate a variety of physiological processes and behaviors by shifting the organism from a relaxed or dormant condition to a responsive, excited and alerted state. Even though OA/TA neurons of the central brain are described on single cell level in Drosophila melanogaster, the periphery was largely omitted from anatomical studies. Given that OA/TA is involved in behaviors like feeding, flying and locomotion, which highly depend on a variety of peripheral organs, it is necessary to study the peripheral connections of these neurons to get a complete picture of the OA/TA circuitry. We here describe the anatomy of this aminergic system in relation to peripheral tissues of the entire fly. OA/TA neurons arborize onto skeletal muscles all over the body and innervate reproductive organs, the heart, the corpora allata, and sensory organs in the antennae, legs, wings and halteres underlining their relevance in modulating complex behaviors.","Scientific reports","30333565",2018,"International"
"Diabetes with heart failure increases methylglyoxal modifications in the sarcomere, which inhibit function.","Patients with diabetes are at significantly higher risk of developing heart failure. Increases in advanced glycation end products are a proposed pathophysiological link, but their impact and mechanism remain incompletely understood. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a glycolysis byproduct, elevated in diabetes, and modifies arginine and lysine residues. We show that left ventricular myofilament from patients with diabetes and heart failure (dbHF) exhibited increased MG modifications compared with nonfailing controls (NF) or heart failure patients without diabetes. In skinned NF human and mouse cardiomyocytes, acute MG treatment depressed both calcium sensitivity and maximal calcium-activated force in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, dbHF myocytes were resistant to myofilament functional changes from MG treatment, indicating that myofilaments from dbHF patients already had depressed function arising from MG modifications. In human dbHF and MG-treated mice, mass spectrometry identified increased MG modifications on actin and myosin. Cosedimentation and in vitro motility assays indicate that MG modifications on actin and myosin independently depress calcium sensitivity, and mechanistically, the functional consequence requires actin/myosin interaction with thin-filament regulatory proteins. MG modification of the myofilament may represent a critical mechanism by which diabetes induces heart failure, as well as a therapeutic target to avoid the development of or ameliorate heart failure in these patients.","JCI insight","30333300",2018,"United States"

"Intracellular oxygen mapping using a myoglobin-mCherry probe with fluorescence lifetime imaging.","Oxygen (O2) is one of the most important biometabolites. In abundance, it serves as the limiting terminus of aerobic respiratory chains in the mitochondria of higher organisms; in deficit, it is a potent determinant of development and regulation of other physiological and therapeutic processes. Most knowledge on intracellular and interstitial concentration ([O2]) is derived from mitochondria isolated from cells or tissue biopsies, providing detailed but nonnative insight into respiratory chain function. The possible loss of essential metabolites during isolation and disruption of the normal interactions of the organelle with the cytoskeleton may cause these data to misrepresent intact cells. Several optical methodologies were also developed, but they are often unable to detect heterogeneity of metabolic characteristics among different individual cells in the same culture, and most cannot detect heterogeneous consumption within different areas of a single cell. Here, we propose a noninvasive and highly sensitive fluorescence lifetime microscopy probe, myoglobin-mCherry, appropriate to intracellular targeting. Using our probe, we monitor mitochondrial contributions to O2 consumption in A549 nonsmall cell lung cancer cells and we reveal heterogeneous [O2] within the intracellular environments. The mitochondrial [O2] at a single-cell level is also mapped by adding a peptide to target the probe to the mitochondria.","Journal of biomedical optics","30298706",2018,"United States"
"Over-expression of PD-1 Does Not Predict Leukemic Relapse after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.","Blockade of the T-cell exhaustion marker PD-1 to re-energize the immune response is emerging as a promising cancer treatment. Relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation limits the success of this approach, and PD-1 blockade may hold therapeutic promise. However, PD-1 expression and its relationship with post-transplant relapse is poorly described. Because the donor immunity is activated by alloresponses, PD-1 expression may differ from nontransplanted individuals, and PD-1 blockade could risk graft-versus-host disease. Here we analyzed T-cell exhaustion marker kinetics and their relationship with leukemia relapse in 85 patients undergoing myeloablative T-cell-depleted HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 35 (44%) patients relapsed. PD-1 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells was comparably elevated in relapsed and nonrelapsed cohorts. Helios<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells and CD8 effector memory cells at day 30 emerged as independent predictors of relapse. Although leukemia antigen-specific T cells did not overexpress PD-1, single-cell analysis revealed LAG3 and TIM3 overexpression at relapse. These findings indicate that PD-1 is an unreliable marker for leukemia-specific T-cell exhaustion in relapsing patients but implies other exhaustion markers and suppressor cells as relapse biomarkers.","Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","30292745",2018,"United States"
"Geometry-Dependent Arrhythmias in Electrically Excitable Tissues.","Little is known about how individual cells sense the macroscopic geometry of their tissue environment. Here, we explore whether long-range electrical signaling can convey information on tissue geometry to individual cells. First, we studied an engineered electrically excitable cell line. Cells grown in patterned islands of different shapes showed remarkably diverse firing patterns under otherwise identical conditions, including regular spiking, period-doubling alternans, and arrhythmic firing. A Hodgkin-Huxley numerical model quantitatively reproduced these effects, showing how the macroscopic geometry affected the single-cell electrophysiology via the influence of gap junction-mediated electrical coupling. Qualitatively similar geometry-dependent dynamics were observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. The cardiac results urge caution in translating observations of arrhythmia in<U+00A0>vitro to predictions in<U+00A0>vivo, where the tissue geometry is very different.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Cardiac Differentiation from Human PSCs Reveals HOPX-Dependent Cardiomyocyte Maturation.","Cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) requires orchestration of dynamic gene regulatory networks during stepwise fate transitions but often generates immature cell types that do not fully recapitulate properties of their adult counterparts, suggesting incomplete activation of key transcriptional networks. We performed extensive single-cell transcriptomic analyses to map fate choices and gene expression programs during cardiac differentiation of hPSCs and identified strategies to improve in<U+00A0>vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation. Utilizing genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we found that hypertrophic signaling is not effectively activated during monolayer-based cardiac differentiation, thereby preventing expression of HOPX and its activation of downstream genes that govern late stages of cardiomyocyte maturation. This study therefore provides a key transcriptional roadmap of in<U+00A0>vitro cardiac differentiation at single-cell resolution, revealing fundamental mechanisms underlying heart development and differentiation of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.","Cell stem cell","30290179",2018,"United States"
"The deployment of cell lineages that form the mammalian heart.","The function of the mammalian heart depends on the interplay between different cardiac cell types. The deployment of these cells, with precise spatiotemporal regulation, is also important during development to establish the heart structure. In this Review, we discuss the diverse origins of cardiac cell types and the lineage relationships between cells of a given type that contribute to different parts of the heart. The emerging lineage tree shows the progression of cell fate diversification, with patterning cues preceding cell type segregation, as well as points of convergence, with overlapping lineages contributing to a given tissue. Several cell lineage markers have been identified. However, caution is required with genetic-tracing experiments in comparison with clonal analyses. Genetic studies on cell populations provided insights into the mechanisms for lineage decisions. In the past 3 years, results of single-cell transcriptomics are beginning to reveal cell heterogeneity and early developmental trajectories. Equating this information with the in vivo location of cells and their lineage history is a current challenge. Characterization of the progenitor cells that form the heart and of the gene regulatory networks that control their deployment is of major importance for understanding the origin of congenital heart malformations and for producing cardiac tissue for use in regenerative medicine.","Nature reviews.

"Identification of functionally distinct fibro-inflammatory and adipogenic stromal subpopulations in visceral adipose tissue of adult mice.","White adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling is dictated by coordinated interactions between adipocytes and resident stromal-vascular cells; however, the functional heterogeneity of adipose stromal cells has remained unresolved. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and FACS to identify and isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of PDGFR¦Â+ stromal cells within visceral WAT of adult mice. LY6C- CD9- PDGFR¦Â+ cells represent highly adipogenic visceral adipocyte precursor cells ('APCs'), whereas LY6C+ PDGFR¦Â+ cells represent fibro-inflammatory progenitors ('FIPs'). FIPs lack adipogenic capacity, display pro-fibrogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and can exert an anti-adipogenic effect on APCs. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of PDGFR¦Â+ cells is regulated, at least in part, by NR4A nuclear receptors. These data highlight the functional heterogeneity of visceral WAT perivascular cells, and provide insight into potential cell-cell interactions impacting adipogenesis and inflammation. These improved strategies to isolate FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT will facilitate the study of physiological WAT remodeling and mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction.This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

"Single-nucleus transcriptomic survey of cell diversity and functional maturation in postnatal mammalian hearts.","A fundamental challenge in understanding cardiac biology and disease is that the remarkable heterogeneity in cell type composition and functional states have not been well characterized at single-cell resolution in maturing and diseased mammalian hearts. Massively parallel single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to address these questions by interrogating the transcriptome of tens of thousands of nuclei isolated from fresh or frozen tissues. snRNA-seq overcomes the technical challenge of isolating intact single cells from complex tissues, including the maturing mammalian hearts; reduces biased recovery of easily dissociated cell types; and minimizes aberrant gene expression during the whole-cell dissociation. Here we applied sNucDrop-seq, a droplet microfluidics-based massively parallel snRNA-seq method, to investigate the transcriptional landscape of postnatal maturing mouse hearts in both healthy and disease states. By profiling the transcriptome of nearly 20,000 nuclei, we identified major and rare cardiac cell types and revealed significant heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in postnatal developing hearts. When applied to a mouse model of pediatric mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, we uncovered profound cell type-specific modifications of the cardiac transcriptional landscape at single-nucleus resolution, including changes of subtype composition, maturation states, and functional remodeling of each cell type. Furthermore, we employed sNucDrop-seq to decipher the cardiac cell type-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) of GDF15, a heart-derived hormone and clinically important diagnostic biomarker of heart disease. Together, our results present a rich resource for studying cardiac biology and provide new insights into heart disease using an approach broadly applicable to many fields of biomedicine.","Genes &amp; development","30254108",2018,"United States"

"Cardiac spiral wave drifting due to spatial temperature gradients - A numerical study.","Cardiac rotors are believed to be a major driver source of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), and their spatiotemporal characterization is essential for successful ablation procedures. However, electrograms guided ablation have not been proven to have benefit over empirical ablation thus far, and there is a strong need of improving the localization of cardiac arrhythmogenic targets for ablation. A new approach for characterize rotors is proposed that is based on induced spatial temperature gradients (STGs), and investigated by theoretical study using numerical simulations. We hypothesize that such gradients will cause rotor drifting due to induced spatial heterogeneity in excitability, so that rotors could be driven towards the ablating probe. Numerical simulations were conducted in single cell and 2D atrial models using AF remodeled kinetics. STGs were applied either linearly on the entire tissue or as a small local perturbation, and the major ion channel rate constants were adjusted following Arrhenius equation. In the AF-remodeled single cell, recovery time increased exponentially with decreasing temperatures, despite the marginal effect of temperature on the action potential duration. In 2D models, spiral waves drifted with drifting velocity components affected by both temperature gradient direction and the spiral wave rotation direction. Overall, spiral waves drifted towards the colder tissue region associated with global minimum of excitability. A local perturbation with a temperature of T<U+202F>=<U+202F>28<U+00A0>¡ãC was found optimal for spiral wave attraction for the studied conditions. This work provides a preliminary proof-of-concept for a potential prospective technique for rotor attraction. We envision that the insights from this study will be utilize in the future in the design of a new methodology for AF characterization and termination during ablation procedures.","Medical engineering &amp; physics","30201284",2018,"England"

Both systems utilize filopodia as their cellular protrusion organelles and depend on specific integrin-mediated adhesions to the local extracellular matrix for guidance in their pathfinding. We discuss the similar molecular machineries involved in these two types of cell branch formation and use their analogy to propose a new mechanism for angiogenic filopodia function, namely as adhesion assembly sites. In support of this model we provide primary data of angiogenesis in zebrafish in vivo showing that the actin assembly factor VASP participates in both filopodia formation and adhesion assembly at the base of the filopodia, enabling forward progress of the tip cell. The use of filopodia and their associated adhesions provide a common mechanism for neuronal and endothelial pathfinding during development in response to extracellular matrix cues.","Developmental biology","30193787",2018,"United States"

"Endocrine lineage biases arise in temporally distinct endocrine progenitors during pancreatic morphogenesis.","Decoding the molecular composition of individual Ngn3<U+2009>+<U+2009>endocrine progenitors (EPs) during pancreatic morphogenesis could provide insight into the mechanisms regulating hormonal cell fate. Here, we identify population markers and extensive cellular diversity including four EP subtypes reflecting EP maturation using high-resolution single-cell RNA-sequencing of the e14.5 and e16.5 mouse pancreas. While e14.5 and e16.5 EPs are constantly born and share select genes, these EPs are overall transcriptionally distinct concomitant with changes in the underlying epithelium. As a consequence, e16.5 EPs are not the same as e14.5 EPs: e16.5 EPs have a higher propensity to form beta cells. Analysis of e14.5 and e16.5 EP chromatin states reveals temporal shifts, with enrichment of beta cell motifs in accessible regions at later stages. Finally, we provide transcriptional maps outlining the route progenitors take as they make cell fate decisions, which can be applied to advance the in vitro generation of beta cells.","Nature communications","30135482",2018,"United States"
"Dgcr8 deletion in the primitive heart uncovered novel microRNA regulating the balance of cardiac-vascular gene program.","Primitive mammalian heart transforms from a single tube to a four-chambered muscular organ during a short developmental window. We found that knocking out global microRNA by deleting Dgcr8 microprocessor in Mesp1 cardiovascular progenitor cells lead to the formation of extremely dilated and enlarged heart due to defective cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation. Transcriptome analysis revealed unusual upregulation of vascular gene expression in Dgcr8 cKO hearts. Single cell RNA sequencing study further confirmed the increase of angiogenesis genes in single Dgcr8 cKO CM. We also performed global microRNA profiling of E9.5 heart for the first time, and identified that miR-541 was transiently highly expressed in E9.5 hearts. Interestingly, introducing miR-541 back into microRNA-free CMs partially rescued their defects, downregulated angiogenesis genes and significantly upregulated cardiac genes. Moreover, miR-541 can target Ctgf and inhibit endothelial function. Our results suggest that microRNAs are required to suppress abnormal angiogenesis gene program to maintain CM differentiation.","Protein &amp; cell","30128894",2018,"Germany"

"In situ transcriptome characteristics are lost following culture adaptation of adult cardiac stem cells.","Regenerative therapeutic approaches for myocardial diseases often involve delivery of stem cells expanded ex vivo. Prior studies indicate that cell culture conditions affect functional and phenotypic characteristics, but relationship(s) of cultured cells derived from freshly isolated populations and the heterogeneity of the cultured population remain poorly defined. Functional and phenotypic characteristics of ex vivo expanded cells will determine outcomes of interventional treatment for disease, necessitating characterization of the impact that ex vivo expansion has upon isolated stem cell populations. Single-cell RNA-Seq profiling (scRNA-Seq) was performed to determine consequences of culture expansion upon adult cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) as well as relationships with other cell populations. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that identity marker genes expressed in freshly isolated cells become undetectable in cultured CPCs while low level expression emerges for thousands of other genes. Transcriptional profile of CPCs exhibited greater degree of similarity throughout the cultured population relative to freshly isolated cells. Findings were validated by comparative analyses using scRNA-Seq datasets of various cell types generated by multiple scRNA-Seq technology. Increased transcriptome diversity and decreased population heterogeneity in the cultured cell population may help account for reported outcomes associated with experimental and clinical use of CPCs for treatment of myocardial injury.","Scientific reports","30104715",2018,"United States"
"Isolation of Atrial Cardiomyocytes from a Rat Model of Metabolic Syndrome-related Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.","In this article, we describe an optimized, Langendorff-based procedure for the isolation of single-cell atrial cardiomyocytes (ACMs) from a rat model of metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The prevalence of MetS-related HFpEF is rising, and atrial cardiomyopathies associated with atrial remodeling and atrial fibrillation are clinically highly relevant as atrial remodeling is an independent predictor of mortality. Studies with isolated single-cell cardiomyocytes are frequently used to corroborate and complement in vivo findings. Circulatory vessel rarefication and interstitial tissue fibrosis pose a potentially limiting factor for the successful single-cell isolation of ACMs from animal models of this disease. We have addressed this issue by employing a device capable of manually regulating the intraluminal pressure of cardiac cavities during the isolation procedure, substantially increasing the yield of morphologically and functionally intact ACMs. The acquired cells can be used in a variety of different experiments, such as cell culture and functional Calcium imaging (i.e., excitation-contraction-coupling). We provide the researcher with a step-by-step protocol, a list of optimized solutions, thorough instructions to prepare the necessary equipment, and a comprehensive troubleshooting guide. While the initial implementation of the procedure might be rather difficult, a successful adaptation will allow the reader to perform state-of-the-art ACM isolations in a rat model of MetS-related HFpEF for a broad spectrum of experiments.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","30102264",2018,"United States"

Notably, prolonged Tbx6 expression suppressed cardiac differentiation and induced somite lineages, including skeletal muscle and chondrocytes. Thus, Tbx6 is critical for mesoderm induction and subsequent lineage diversification.","Cell stem cell","30100166",2018,"United States"
"The Influence of the Timing of Cyclic Load Application on Cardiac Cell Contraction.","Cardiac cells are subjected to mechanical load during each heart-beat. Normal heart load is essential for physiological development and cardiac function. At the same time, excessive load can induce pathologies such as cardiac hypertrophy. While the forces working on the heart as an organ are well-understood, information regarding stretch response at the cellular level is limited. Since cardiac stretch-response depends on the amplitude and pattern of the applied load as well as its timing during the beating cycle, the directionality of load application and its phase relative to action potential generation must be controlled precisely. Here, we design a new experimental setup, which enables high-resolution fluorescence imaging of cultured cardiac cells under cyclic uniaxial mechanical load and electrical stimulation. Cyclic stretch was applied in different phases relative to the electrical stimulus and the effect on cardiac cell beating was monitored. The results show a clear phase-dependent response and provide insight into cardiac response to excessive loading conditions.","Frontiers in physiology","30072912",2018,"Switzerland"

AFM technique has undergone many successful improvements since its invention, including fluidic force microscopy (FluidFM), which combines conventional AFM with microchanneled cantilevers for local liquid dispensing. This technology permitted to overcome challenges linked to single-cell analyses. Indeed, FluidFM allows isolation and injection of single cells, force-controlled patch clamping of beating cardiac cells, serial weighting of micro-objects, and single-cell extraction for molecular analyses.

"Droplet digital PCR shows the D-Loop to be an error prone locus for mitochondrial DNA copy number determination.","Absolute quantification of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mCN) provides important insights in many fields of research including cancer, cardiovascular and reproductive health. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) natively reports absolute copy number, and we have developed a single-dye, multiplex assay to measure rat mCN that is accurate, precise and affordable. We demonstrate simple methods to optimize this assay and to determine nuclear reference pseudogene copy number to extend the range of mCN that can be measured with this assay. We evaluated two commonly used mitochondrial DNA reference loci to determine mCN, the ND1 gene and the D-Loop. Harnessing the absolute measures of ddPCR, we found that the D-Loop amplifies with a copy number of ~1.0-1.5 relative to other sites on the mitochondrial genome. This anomalous copy number varied significantly between rats and tissues (aorta, brain, heart, liver, soleus muscle). We advocate for avoiding the D-Loop as a mitochondrial reference in future studies of mCN. Further, we report a novel approach to quantifying immunolabelled mitochondrial DNA that provides single-cell estimates of mCN that closely agree with the population analyses by ddPCR. The combination of these assays represents a cost-effective and powerful suite of tools to study mCN.","Scientific reports","30061621",2018,"England"
"Automated quantitative analysis of multiple cardiomyocytes at the single-cell level with three-dimensional holographic imaging informatics.","Cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells are a promising tool for disease modeling, drug compound testing, and cardiac toxicity screening. Bio-image segmentation is a prerequisite step in cardiomyocyte image analysis by digital holography (DH) in microscopic configuration and has provided satisfactory results. In this study, we quantified multiple cardiac cells from segmented 3-dimensional DH images at the single-cell level and measured multiple parameters describing the beating profile of each individual cell. The beating profile is extracted by monitoring dry-mass distribution during the mechanical contraction-relaxation activity caused by cardiac action potential. We present a robust two-step segmentation method for cardiomyocyte low-contrast image segmentation based on region and edge information.

"Cellular self-assembly into 3D microtissues enhances the angiogenic activity and functional neovascularization capacity of human cardiopoietic stem cells.","While cell therapy has been proposed as next-generation therapy to treat the diseased heart, current strategies display only limited clinical efficacy. Besides the ongoing quest for the ideal cell type, in particular the very low retention rate of single-cell (SC) suspensions after delivery remains a major problem. To improve cellular retention, cellular self-assembly into 3D microtissues (MTs) prior to transplantation has emerged as an encouraging alternative. Importantly, 3D-MTs have also been reported to enhance the angiogenic activity and neovascularization potential of stem cells. Therefore, here using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay we comprehensively evaluate the impact of cell format (SCs versus 3D-MTs) on the angiogenic potential of human cardiopoietic stem cells, a promising second-generation cell type for cardiac repair. Biodegradable collagen scaffolds were seeded with human cardiopoietic stem cells, either as SCs or as 3D-MTs generated by using a modified hanging drop method. Thereafter, seeded scaffolds were placed on the CAM of living chicken embryos and analyzed for their perfusion capacity in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging assessment which was then linked to a longitudinal histomorphometric ex vivo analysis comprising blood vessel density and characteristics such as shape and size. Cellular self-assembly into 3D-MTs led to a significant increase of vessel density mainly driven by a higher number of neo-capillary formation. In contrast, SC-seeded scaffolds displayed a higher frequency of larger neo-vessels resulting in an overall 1.76-fold higher total vessel area (TVA). Importantly, despite that larger TVA in SC-seeded group, the mean perfusion capacity (MPC) was comparable between groups, therefore suggesting functional superiority together with an enhanced perfusion efficacy of the neo-vessels in 3D-MT-seeded scaffolds. This was further underlined by a 1.64-fold higher perfusion ratio when relating MPC to TVA. Our study shows that cellular self-assembly of human cardiopoietic stem cells into 3D-MTs substantially enhances their overall angiogenic potential and their functional neovascularization capacity. Hence, the concept of 3D-MTs may be considered to increase the therapeutic efficacy of future cell therapy concepts.","Angiogenesis","30014173",2018,"Germany"

"In Vivo Nanovector Delivery of a Heart-specific MicroRNA-sponge.","MicroRNA (miRNA) is small non-coding RNA which inhibits post-transcriptional messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Human diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, have been shown to activate tissue and/or cell-specific miRNA expression associated with disease progression. The inhibition of miRNA expression offers the potential for a therapeutic intervention. However, traditional approaches to inhibit miRNAs, employing antagomir oligonucleotides, affect specific miRNA functions upon global delivery. Herein, we present a protocol for the in vivo cardio-specific inhibition of the miR-181 family in a rat model. A miRNA-sponge construct is designed to include 10 repeated anti-miR-181 binding sequences. The cardio-specific ¦Á-MHC promoter is cloned into the pEGFP backbone to drive the cardio-specific miR-181 miRNA-sponge expression. To create a stable cell line expressing the miR-181-sponge, myoblast H9c2 cells are transfected with the ¦Á-MHC-EGFP-miR-181-sponge construct and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACs) into GFP positive H9c2 cells which are cultured with neomycin (G418). Following stable growth in neomycin, monoclonal cell populations are established by additional FACs and single cell cloning. The resulting myoblast H9c2-miR-181-sponge-GFP cells exhibit a loss of function of miR-181 family members as assessed through the increased expression of miR-181 target proteins and compared to H9c2 cells expressing a scramble non-functional sponge. In addition, we develop a nanovector for the systemic delivery of the miR-181-sponge construct by complexing positively charged liposomal nanoparticles and negatively charged miR-181-sponge plasmids. In vivo imaging of GFP reveals that multiple tail vein injections of a nanovector over a three-week period are able to promote a significant expression of the miR-181-sponge in a cardio-specific manner. Importantly, a loss of miR-181 function is observed in the heart tissue but not in the kidney or the liver. The miRNA-sponge is a powerful method to inhibit tissue-specific miRNA expression. Driving the miRNA-sponge expression from a tissue-specific promoter provides specificity for the miRNA inhibition, which can be confined to a targeted organ or tissue. Furthermore, combining nanovector and miRNA-sponge technologies permits an effective delivery and tissue-specific miRNA inhibition in vivo.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","29985373",2018,"United States"
"Neonatal Murine Engineered Cardiac Tissue Toxicology Model: Impact of Metallothionein Overexpression on Cadmium-Induced Injury.","Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) serve as robust in vitro models to study human cardiac diseases including cardiac toxicity assays due to rapid structural and functional maturation and the ability to vary ECT composition. Metallothionein (MT) has been shown to be cardioprotective for environmental toxicants including heavy metals. To date, studies on the role of cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific MT expression and function have occurred in dissociated single cell assays or expensive in vivo small animal models. Therefore, we generated 3D ECTs using neonatal mouse ventricular cells from wild-type (WT) and the CM-specific overexpressing MT-transgenic (MT-TG) to determine the effect of MT overexpression on ECT maturation and function. Because Cadmium (Cd) is an environmentally prevalent heavy metal toxicant with direct negative impact on cardiac structure and function, we then determined the effect of MT overexpression to reduce Cd mediated CM toxicity within ECTs. We found: (1) structural and functional maturation was similar in WT and MT-TG ECTs; (2) Cd exposure negatively impacted ECT cell survival, maturation, and function; and (3) MT-ECTs showed reduced Cd toxicity as defined by reduced cleaved caspase 3, reduced Bax/Bcl2 ratio, reduced TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling positive cells, reduced CM loss after Cd treatment, and delayed onset of cardiac dysfunction after Cd treatment. Thus, neonatal murine ECTs can serve as a robust in vitro model for heavy metal toxicity screening and as a platform to evaluate the role cardioprotective mechanisms, such as the MT-TG model, on environmentally relevant toxicants.","Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology","29982767",2018,"United States"
"New Paradigms in Cell Therapy: Repeated Dosing, Intravenous Delivery, Immunomodulatory Actions, and New Cell Types.","Perhaps the most important advance in the field of cell therapy for heart disease has been the recognition that all stem/progenitor cells (both adult and embryonic) fail to engraft in the heart to a significant extent and thus work via paracrine mechanisms. This fundamental advance has led to 4 new paradigms that are discussed in this review and that may importantly shape, or even revolutionize, the future of the field: (1) repeated cell therapy, (2) intravenous cell therapy, (3) immunomodulatory actions of cell therapy, and (4) new cell types. Because virtually all of our current knowledge of cell therapy is predicated on the effects of a single cell dose, the idea that the full therapeutic effects of a cell product require repeated doses is disruptive and has far-reaching implications. For example, inadequate dosing (single-dose protocols) may be responsible, at least in part, for the borderline or disappointing results obtained to date in clinical trials; furthermore, future studies (both preclinical and clinical) may need to incorporate repeated cell administrations. Another disruptive idea, supported by emerging preclinical and clinical evidence, is that intravenously injected cells can produce beneficial effects on the heart, presumably via release of paracrine factors in extracardiac organs or endocrine factors into the systemic circulation. Intravenous administration would obviate the need for direct delivery of cells to the heart, making cell therapy simpler, cheaper, safer, more scalable, and more broadly available, even on an outpatient basis. Although the mechanism of action of cell therapy remains elusive, there is compelling in vitro evidence that transplanted cells modulate the function of various immune cell types via release of paracrine factors, such as extracellular vesicles, although in vivo evidence is still limited. Investigation of the new paradigms reviewed herein should be a top priority because it may profoundly transform cell therapy and finally make it a reality.","Circulation research","29976684",2018,"United States"
"Single-cell analysis of early progenitor cells that build coronary arteries.","Arteries and veins are specified by antagonistic transcriptional programs. However, during development and regeneration, new arteries can arise from pre-existing veins through a poorly understood process of cell fate conversion. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and mouse genetics, we show that vein cells of the developing heart undergo an early cell fate switch to create a pre-artery population that subsequently builds coronary arteries. Vein cells underwent a gradual and simultaneous switch from venous to arterial fate before a subset of cells crossed a transcriptional threshold into the pre-artery state. Before the onset of coronary blood flow, pre-artery cells appeared in the immature vessel plexus, expressed mature artery markers, and decreased cell cycling. The vein-specifying transcription factor COUP-TF2 (also known as NR2F2) prevented plexus cells from overcoming the pre-artery threshold by inducing cell cycle genes. Thus, vein-derived coronary arteries are built by pre-artery cells that can differentiate independently of blood flow upon the release of inhibition mediated by COUP-TF2 and cell cycle factors.","Nature","29973725",2018,"United States"

The goals of this study were to apply a simple and efficient method for differentiation of iPSCs into defined functional CM subtypes in feeder-free conditions and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular, cell biological, and functional properties of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs on both the single-cell and engineered heart muscle (EHM) level. By a stage-specific activation of retinoic acid signaling in monolayer-based and well-defined culture, we showed that cardiac progenitors can be directed towards a highly homogeneous population of atrial CMs. By combining the transcriptome and proteome profiling of the iPSC-CM subtypes with functional characterizations via optical action potential and calcium imaging, and with contractile analyses in EHM, we demonstrated that atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and -EHM highly correspond to the atrial and ventricular heart muscle, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and functional identities characteristic of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and -EHM and supports their suitability in disease modeling and chamber-specific drug screening.","JCI insight","29925689",2018,"United States"
"The effect of myocardial action potential duration on cardiac pumping efficacy: a computational study.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although studies on the relation between arrhythmias and the action potential duration (APD) have been carried out, most of them are based only on electrophysiological factors of the heart and lack experiments that consider cardiac mechanical and electromechanical characteristics. Therefore, we conducted this study to clarify the relevance of the shortening of APD of a cell in relation to the mechanical contraction activity of the heart and the associated risk of arrhythmia.CONCLUSION: The shortening of APD owing to increased electrical conductivity of a protein channel on myocardial cells likely decreases the wavelength and the pumping efficiency of the ventricles. Additionally, it may increase tissue sensitivity to ventricular fibrillation, including reentry, and cause symptoms such as dyspnea and dizziness.","Biomedical engineering online","29907152",2018,"England"

"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Cardiovascular Disease Modeling and Precision Medicine: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unprece-dented opportunity to study human physiology and disease at the cellular level. They also have the potential to be leveraged in the practice of precision medicine, for example, personalized drug testing. This statement comprehensively describes the provenance of iPSC lines, their use for cardiovascular disease modeling, their use for precision medicine, and strategies through which to promote their wider use for biomedical applications. Human iPSCs exhibit properties that render them uniquely qualified as model systems for studying human diseases: they are of human origin, which means they carry human genomes; they are pluripotent, which means that in principle, they can be differentiated into any of the human body's somatic cell types; and they are stem cells, which means they can be expanded from a single cell into millions or even billions of cell progeny. iPSCs offer the opportunity to study cells that are genetically matched to individual patients, and genome-editing tools allow introduction or correction of genetic variants. Initial progress has been made in using iPSCs to better understand cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders, valvular and vascular disorders, and metabolic risk factors for ischemic heart disease. This promising work is still in its infancy. Similarly, iPSCs are only just starting to be used to identify the optimal medications to be used in patients from whom the cells were derived. This statement is intended to (1) summarize the state of the science with respect to the use of iPSCs for modeling of cardiovascular traits and disorders and for therapeutic screening; (2) identify opportunities and challenges in the use of iPSCs for disease modeling and precision medicine; and (3) outline strategies that will facilitate the use of iPSCs for biomedical applications.

"Long Non-coding RNAs in Endothelial Biology.","In recent years, the role of RNA has expanded to the extent that protein-coding RNAs are now the minority with a variety of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) now comprising the majority of RNAs in higher organisms. A major contributor to this shift in understanding is RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which allows a largely unconstrained method for monitoring the status of RNA from whole organisms down to a single cell. This observational power presents both challenges and new opportunities, which require specialized bioinformatics tools to extract knowledge from the data and the ability to reuse data for multiple studies. In this review, we summarize the current status of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) research in endothelial biology. Then, we will cover computational methods for identifying, annotating, and characterizing lncRNAs in the heart, especially endothelial cells.","Frontiers in physiology","29867565",2018,"Switzerland"

"Muscle fiber type diversity revealed by anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies.","Different forms of myosin heavy chains (MyHCs), coded by a large family of sarcomeric MYH genes, are expressed in striated muscles. The generation of specific anti-MyHC antibodies has provided a powerful tool to define the fiber types present in skeletal muscles, their functional properties, their response to conditions that affect muscle plasticity and their changes in muscle disorders. Cardiomyocyte heterogeneity has been revealed by the serendipitous observation that different MyHCs are present in atrial and ventricular myocardium and in heart conduction tissue. Developmental MyHCs present in embryonic and fetal/neonatal skeletal muscle are re-expressed during muscle regeneration and can be used to identify regenerating fibers in muscle diseases. MyHC isoforms provide cell type-specific markers to identify the signaling pathways that control muscle cell identity and are an essential reference to interpret the results of single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics.","The FEBS journal","29761627",2018,"England"

"The Isolation and Culture of Primary Epicardial Cells Derived from Human Adult and Fetal Heart Specimens.","The epicardium, an epithelial cell layer covering the myocardium, has an essential role during cardiac development, as well as in the repair response of the heart after ischemic injury. When activated, epicardial cells undergo a process known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to provide cells to the regenerating myocardium. Furthermore, the epicardium contributes via secretion of essential paracrine factors. To fully appreciate the regenerative potential of the epicardium, a human cell model is required. Here we outline a novel cell culture model to derive primary epicardial derived cells (EPDCs) from human adult and fetal cardiac tissue. To isolate EPDCs, the epicardium is dissected from the outside of the heart specimen and processed into a single cell suspension. Next, EPDCs are plated and cultured in EPDC medium containing the ALK 5-kinase inhibitor SB431542 to maintain their epithelial phenotype. EMT is induced by stimulation with TGF¦Â. This method enables, for the first time, the study of the process of human epicardial EMT in a controlled setting, and facilitates gaining more insight in the secretome of EPDCs that may aid heart regeneration. Furthermore, this uniform approach allows for direct comparison of human adult and fetal epicardial behavior.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","29757271",2018,"United States"

"Hippo Signaling Plays an Essential Role in Cell State Transitions during Cardiac Fibroblast Development.","During development, progenitors progress through transition states. The cardiac epicardium contains progenitors of essential non-cardiomyocytes. The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade that inhibits the Yap transcriptional co-factor, controls organ size in developing hearts. Here, we investigated Hippo kinases Lats1 and Lats2 in epicardial diversification. Epicardial-specific deletion of Lats1/2 was embryonic lethal, and mutant embryos had defective coronary vasculature remodeling. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Lats1/2 mutant cells failed to activate fibroblast differentiation but remained in an intermediate cell state with both epicardial and fibroblast characteristics. Lats1/2 mutant cells displayed an arrested developmental trajectory with persistence of epicardial markers and expanded expression of Yap targets Dhrs3, an inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis, and Dpp4, a protease that modulates extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Genetic and pharmacologic manipulation revealed that Yap inhibits fibroblast differentiation, prolonging a subepicardial-like cell state, and promotes expression of matricellular factors, such as Dpp4, that define ECM characteristics.","Developmental cell","29689192",2018,"United States"

This full karyotype analysis approach will provide additional diagnostic potential for single cell analysis. The use of spectral imaging (SIm) has enabled the use of up to eight different fluorochrome labels simultaneously. Thus, scoring can be easily assessed by visual inspection, because SIm permits computer-assigned and distinguishable pseudo-colors to each probe during image processing.

"Investigation of human iPSC-derived cardiac myocyte functional maturation by single cell traction force microscopy.","Recent advances have made it possible to readily derive cardiac myocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). HiPSC-CMs represent a valuable new experimental model for studying human cardiac muscle physiology and disease. Many laboratories have devoted substantial effort to examining the functional properties of isolated hiPSC-CMs, but to date, force production has not been adequately characterized. Here, we utilized traction force microscopy (TFM) with micro-patterning cell printing to investigate the maximum force production of isolated single hiPSC-CMs under varied culture and assay conditions. We examined the role of length of differentiation in culture and the effects of varied extracellular calcium concentration in the culture media on the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. Results show that hiPSC-CMs developing in culture for two weeks produced significantly less force than cells cultured from one to three months, with hiPSC-CMs cultured for three months resembling the cell morphology and function of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in terms of size, dimensions, and force production. Furthermore, hiPSC-CMs cultured long term in conditions of physiologic calcium concentrations were larger and produced more force than hiPSC-CMs cultured in standard media with sub-physiological calcium. We also examined relationships between cell morphology, substrate stiffness and force production. Results showed a significant relationship between cell area and force. Implementing directed modifications of substrate stiffness, by varying stiffness from embryonic-like to adult myocardium-like, hiPSC-CMs produced maximal forces on substrates with a lower modulus and significantly less force when assayed on increasingly stiff adult myocardium-like substrates. Calculated strain energy measurements paralleled these findings. Collectively, these findings further establish single cell TFM as a valuable approach to illuminate the quantitative physiological maturation of force in hiPSC-CMs.","PloS one","29617427",2018,"United States"

Moreover, cancer heterogeneity renders population-based characterization techniques inadequate, as individual cellular features are lost in the average. Hence, platforms for fast and accurate characterization of biophysical properties of cancer cells at the single-cell level are required. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in the field of cancer biophysics and the development of lab-on-a-chip platforms for single-cell biophysical analyses of cancer cells.","Trends in biotechnology","29559164",2018,"United States"
"Imaging transparent intact cardiac tissue with single-cell resolution.","We developed a new method, SUT (Scheme Update on tissue Transparency), to view cardiac microstructures and unveil the molecular changes underlying cardiac diseases. SUT is an effective method to clear whole-hearts from different species. Over the course of 4 - 6 days we obtained transparent whole-layer left ventricular tissues from mice with only an approximate 1% protein loss. In addition, EAL (Electrophoretic Antibody Labeling) was used to achieve fast antibody labeling by electric force, which significantly reduced antibody incubation time from days to hours. SUT, together with EAL and modern imaging techniques, were successfully used to visualize three-dimensional spatial distribution of various molecules in cardiac tissue. We also observed changes in the number and phenotypes of fibroblasts during post-myocardial infarction in a stereoscopic pattern. We believe that our technique opens a new avenue to explore the mechanisms underlying cardiac diseases.</AbstractText>: We developed a new method, SUT (Scheme Update on tissue Transparency), to view cardiac microstructures and unveil the molecular changes underlying cardiac diseases.

"Mapping metabolic changes by noninvasive, multiparametric, high-resolution imaging using endogenous contrast.","Monitoring subcellular functional and structural changes associated with metabolism is essential for understanding healthy tissue development and the progression of numerous diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, established methods for this purpose either are destructive or require the use of exogenous agents. Recent work has highlighted the potential of endogenous two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) as a method to monitor subtle metabolic changes; however, mechanistic understanding of the connections between the detected optical signal and the underlying metabolic pathways has been lacking. We present a quantitative approach to detecting both functional and structural metabolic biomarkers noninvasively, relying on endogenous TPEF from two coenzymes, NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide). We perform multiparametric analysis of three optical biomarkers within intact, living cells and three-dimensional tissues: cellular redox state, NADH fluorescence lifetime, and mitochondrial clustering. We monitor the biomarkers in cells and tissues subjected to metabolic perturbations that trigger changes in distinct metabolic processes, including glycolysis and glutaminolysis, extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial uncoupling, and fatty acid oxidation and synthesis. We demonstrate that these optical biomarkers provide complementary insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. Thus, when used in combination, these biomarkers can serve as a valuable tool for sensitive, label-free identification of changes in specific metabolic pathways and characterization of the heterogeneity of the elicited responses with single-cell resolution.","Science advances","29536043",2018,"United States"

"Predicting the cardiac toxicity of drugs using a novel multiscale exposure-response simulator.","A common but serious side effect of many drugs is torsades de pointes, a rhythm disorder that can have fatal consequences. Torsadogenic risk has traditionally been associated with blockage of a specific potassium channel and an increased recovery period in the electrocardiogram. However, the mechanisms that trigger torsades de pointes remain incompletely understood. Here we establish a computational model to explore how drug-induced effects propagate from the single channel, via the single cell, to the whole heart level. Our mechanistic exposure-response simulator translates block-concentration characteristics for arbitrary drugs into three-dimensional excitation profiles and electrocardiogram recordings to rapidly assess torsadogenic risk. For the drug of dofetilide, we show that this risk is highly dose-dependent: at a concentration of 1x, QT prolongation is 55% but the heart maintains its regular sinus rhythm; at 5.7x, QT prolongation is 102% and the heart spontaneously transitions into torsades de points; at 30x, QT prolongation is 132% and the heart adapts a quasi-depolarized state with numerous rapidly flickering local excitations. Our simulations suggest that neither potassium channel blockage nor QT interval prolongation alone trigger torsades de pointes. The underlying mechanism predicted by our model is early afterdepolarization, which translates into pronounced U waves in the electrocardiogram, a signature that is correctly predicted by our model. Beyond the risk assessment of existing drugs, our exposure-response simulator can become a powerful tool to optimize the co-administration of drugs and, ultimately, guide the design of new drugs toward reducing life threatening drug-induced rhythm disorders in the heart.","Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering","29493299",2018,"United States"
"An automated workflow for segmenting single adult cardiac cells from large-volume serial block-face scanning electron microscopy data.","This paper presents a new algorithm to automatically segment the myofibrils, mitochondria and nuclei within single adult cardiac cells that are part of a large serial-block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) dataset. The algorithm only requires a set of manually drawn contours that roughly demarcate the cell boundary at routine slice intervals (every 50th, for example). The algorithm correctly classified pixels within the single cell with 97% accuracy when compared to manual segmentations. One entire cell and the partial volumes of two cells were segmented. Analysis of segmentations within these cells showed that myofibrils and mitochondria occupied 47.5% and 51.6% on average respectively, while the nuclei occupy 0.7% of the cell for which the entire volume was captured in the SBF-SEM dataset. Mitochondria clustering increased at the periphery of the nucleus region and branching points of the cardiac cell. The segmentations also showed high area fraction of mitochondria (up to 70% of the 2D image slice) in the sub-sarcolemmal region, whilst it was closer to 50% in the intermyofibrillar space. We finally demonstrate that our segmentations can be turned into 3D finite element meshes for cardiac cell computational physiology studies. We offer our large dataset and MATLAB implementation of the algorithm for research use at www.github.com/CellSMB/sbfsem-cardiac-cell-segmenter/. We anticipate that this timely tool will be of use to cardiac computational and experimental physiologists alike who study cardiac ultrastructure and its role in heart function.","Journal of structural biology","29477758",2018,"United Kingdom"
"Analysis of cardiomyocyte clonal expansion during mouse heart development and injury.","The cellular mechanisms driving cardiac tissue formation remain poorly understood, largely due to the structural and functional complexity of the heart. It is unclear whether newly generated myocytes originate from cardiac stem/progenitor cells or from pre-existing cardiomyocytes that re-enter the cell cycle. Here, we identify the source of new cardiomyocytes during mouse development and after injury. Our findings suggest that cardiac progenitors maintain proliferative potential and are the main source of cardiomyocytes during development; however, the onset of ¦ÁMHC expression leads to reduced cycling capacity. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a proliferative, &quot;progenitor-like&quot; population abundant in early embryonic stages that<U+00A0>decreases to minimal levels postnatally. Furthermore, cardiac injury by ligation of the left anterior descending artery was found to activate cardiomyocyte proliferation in neonatal but not adult mice. Our data suggest that clonal dominance of differentiating progenitors mediates cardiac development, while a distinct subpopulation of cardiomyocytes may have the potential for limited proliferation during late embryonic development and shortly after birth.","Nature communications","29467410",2018,"United States"

"Incorporation of a skeletal muscle-specific enhancer in the regulatory region of Igf1 upregulates IGF1 expression and induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy.","In this study, we upregulated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) expression specifically in skeletal muscle by engineering an enhancer into its non-coding regions and verified the expected phenotype in a mouse model. To select an appropriate site for introducing a skeletal muscle-specific myosin light chain (MLC) enhancer, three candidate sites that exhibited the least evolutionary conservation were chosen and validated in C2C12 single-cell colonies harbouring the MLC enhancer at each site. IGF1 was dramatically upregulated in only the site 2 single-cell colony series, and it exhibited functional activity leading to the formation of extra myotubes. Therefore, we chose site 2 to generate a genetically modified (GM) mouse model with the MLC enhancer incorporated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The GM mice exhibited dramatically elevated IGF1 levels, which stimulated downstream pathways in skeletal muscle. Female GM mice exhibited more conspicuous muscle hypertrophy than male GM mice. The GM mice possessed similar circulating IGF1 levels and tibia length as their WT littermates; they also did not exhibit heart abnormalities. Our findings demonstrate that genetically modifying a non-coding region is a feasible method to upregulate gene expression and obtain animals with desirable traits.","Scientific reports","29426944",2018,"England"
"Predicting drug-induced arrhythmias by multiscale modeling.","Drugs often have undesired side effects. In the heart, they can induce lethal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. The risk evaluation of a new compound is costly and can take a long time, which often hinders the development of new drugs. Here, we establish a high-resolution, multiscale computational model to quickly assess the cardiac toxicity of new and existing drugs. The input of the model is the drug-specific current block from single cell electrophysiology; the output is the spatio-temporal activation profile and the associated electrocardiogram. We demonstrate the potential of our model for a low-risk drug, ranolazine, and a high-risk drug, quinidine: For ranolazine, our model predicts a prolonged QT interval of 19.4% compared with baseline and a regular sinus rhythm at 60.15 beats per minute. For quinidine, our model predicts a prolonged QT interval of 78.4% and a spontaneous development of torsades de pointes both in the activation profile and in the electrocardiogram. Our model reveals the mechanisms by which electrophysiological abnormalities propagate across the spatio-temporal scales, from specific channel blockage, via altered single cell action potentials and prolonged QT intervals, to the spontaneous emergence of ventricular tachycardia in the form of torsades de pointes. Our model could have important implications for researchers, regulatory agencies, and pharmaceutical companies on rationalizing safe drug development and reducing the time-to-market of new drugs.","International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering","29424967",2018,"United States"

"Localization of transcripts, translation, and degradation for spatiotemporal sarcomere maintenance.","The mechanisms responsible for maintaining macromolecular protein complexes, with their proper localization and subunit stoichiometry, are incompletely understood. Here we studied the maintenance of the sarcomere, the basic contractile macromolecular complex of cardiomyocytes. We performed single-cell analysis of cardiomyocytes using imaging of mRNA and protein synthesis, and demonstrate that three distinct mechanisms are responsible for the maintenance of the sarcomere: mRNAs encoding for sarcomeric proteins are localized to the sarcomere, ribosomes are localized to the sarcomere with localized sarcomeric protein translation, and finally, a localized E3 ubiquitin ligase allow efficient degradation of excess unincorporated sarcomeric proteins. We show that these mechanisms are distinct, required, and work in unison, to ensure both spatial localization, and to overcome the large variability in transcription. Cardiomyocytes simultaneously maintain all their sarcomeres using localized translation and degradation processes where proteins are continuously and locally synthesized at high rates, and excess proteins are continuously degraded.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","29371135",2018,"England"
"Growth and Morphogenesis during Early Heart Development in Amniotes.","In this review, we will focus on the growth and morphogenesis of the developing heart, an aspect of cardiovascular development to which Antoon Moorman and colleagues have extensively contributed. Over the last decades, genetic studies and characterization of regionally regulated gene programs have provided abundant novel insights into heart development essential to understand the basis of congenital heart disease. Heart morphogenesis, however, is inherently a complex and dynamic three-dimensional process and we are far from understanding its cellular basis. Here, we discuss recent advances in studying heart morphogenesis and regionalization under the light of the pioneering work of Moorman and colleagues, which allowed the reinterpretation of regional gene expression patterns under a new morphogenetic framework. Two aspects of early heart formation will be discussed in particular: (1) the initial formation of the heart tube and (2) the formation of the cardiac chambers by the ballooning process. Finally, we emphasize that in addition to analyses based on fixed samples, new approaches including clonal analysis, single-cell sequencing, live-imaging and quantitative analysis of the data generated will likely lead to novel insights in understanding early heart tube regionalization and morphogenesis in the near future.","Journal of cardiovascular development and disease","29367549",2018,"Switzerland"

"High content analysis identifies unique morphological features of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes.","Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes is a promising approach for cardiac regeneration but still faces challenges in efficiently generating mature cardiomyocytes. Systematic optimization of reprogramming protocols requires scalable, objective methods to assess cellular phenotype beyond what is captured by transcriptional signatures alone. To address this question, we automatically segmented reprogrammed cardiomyocytes from immunofluorescence images and analyzed cell morphology. We also introduce a method to quantify sarcomere structure using Haralick texture features, called SarcOmere Texture Analysis (SOTA). We show that induced cardiac-like myocytes (iCLMs) are highly variable in expression of cardiomyocyte markers, producing subtypes that are not typically seen in vivo. Compared to neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, iCLMs have more variable cell size and shape, have less organized sarcomere structure, and demonstrate reduced sarcomere length. Taken together, these results indicate that traditional methods of assessing cardiomyocyte reprogramming by quantifying induction of cardiomyocyte marker proteins may not be sufficient to predict functionality. The automated image analysis methods described in this study may enable more systematic approaches for improving reprogramming techniques above and beyond existing algorithms that rely heavily on transcriptome profiling.","Scientific reports","29352247",2018,"United States"

By modeling cardiac ischemia, we illustrate how in silico experiments can contribute to our understanding of how the pathophysiological mechanisms translate into changes observed in diagnostic tools such as the electrocardiogram (ECG).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative in silico modeling spans a<U+00A0>wide range of scales from ion channel biophysics to ECG signals. For each of the scales, a<U+00A0>set of mathematical equations describes electrophysiology in relation to the other scales. Integration of ischemia-induced changes is performed on the ion channel, single-cell, and tissue level. This approach allows us to study how effects simulated at molecular scales translate to changes in the ECG.RESULTS: Ischemia induces action potential shortening and conduction slowing. Hence, ischemic myocardium has distinct and significant effects on propagation and repolarization of excitation, depending on the intramural extent of the ischemic region. For transmural and subendocardial ischemic regions, ST segment elevation and depression, respectively, were observed, whereas intermediate ischemic regions were found to be electrically silent (NSTEMI).CONCLUSIONS: In silico modeling contributes quantitative and mechanistic insight into fundamental ischemia-related arrhythmogenic mechanisms. In addition, computational modeling can help to translate experimental findings at the (sub-)cellular level to the organ and body context (e.<U+2009>g., ECG), thereby providing a<U+00A0>thorough understanding of this routinely used diagnostic tool that may translate into optimized applications.","Herzschrittmachertherapie &amp; Elektrophysiologie","29305703",2018,"Germany"
"Single-cell analysis of the fate of c-kit-positive bone marrow cells.","The plasticity of c-kit-positive bone marrow cells (c-kit-BMCs) in tissues different from their organ of origin remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that c-kit-BMCs are functionally heterogeneous and only a subgroup of these cells possesses cardiomyogenic potential. Population-based assays fall short of identifying the properties of individual stem cells, imposing on us the introduction of single cell-based approaches to track the fate of c-kit-BMCs in the injured heart; they included viral gene-tagging, multicolor clonal-marking and transcriptional profiling. Based on these strategies, we report that single mouse c-kit-BMCs expand clonally within the infarcted myocardium and differentiate into specialized cardiac cells. Newly-formed cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and c-kit-BMCs showed in their genome common sites of viral integration, providing strong evidence in favor of the plasticity of a subset of BMCs expressing the c-kit receptor. Similarly, individual c-kit-BMCs, which were infected with multicolor reporters and injected in infarcted hearts, formed cardiomyocytes and vascular cells organized in clusters of similarly colored cells. The uniform distribution of fluorescent proteins in groups of specialized cells documented the polyclonal nature of myocardial regeneration. The transcriptional profile of myogenic c-kit-BMCs and whole c-kit-BMCs was defined by RNA sequencing. Genes relevant for engraftment, survival, migration, and differentiation were enriched in myogenic c-kit-BMCs, a cell subtype which could not be assigned to a specific hematopoietic lineage. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the bone marrow comprises a category of cardiomyogenic, vasculogenic and/or fibrogenic c-kit-positive cells and a category of c-kit-positive cells that retains an undifferentiated state within the damaged heart.","NPJ Regenerative medicine","29302361",2018,"United States"
"Cellular biomechanics impairment in keratinocytes is associated with a C-terminal truncated desmoplakin: An atomic force microscopy investigation.","In a tissue continuously challenged by mechanical stresses, such as the skin or the heart, cells perceive information about their microenvironment through several adhesive protein complexes and activate cell-signaling events to maintain tissue cohesion. Consequently, alteration of cell adhesion components leads to aberrant assembly of the associated cytoplasmic scaffolding and signaling pathways, which may reflect changes to the tissue physiology and mechanical resistance. Desmoplakin is an essential component of the cell-cell junction, anchoring the desmosomal protein complex to the intermediate filaments (IFs). Inherited mutations in desmoplakin are associated with both heart and skin disease (cardiocutaneous syndrome). In this study, we investigated the mechanical properties of human keratinocytes harboring a cardiocutaneous-associated homozygous C-terminal truncation in desmoplakin (JD-1) compared to a control keratinocyte line (K1). Using Single Cell Force Spectroscopy (SCFS) AFM-based measurements, JD-1 keratinocytes displayed an overall alteration in morphology, elasticity, adhesion capabilities and viscoelastic properties, highlighting the profound interconnection between the adhesome pathways and the IF scaffold.","Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)","29291530",2018,"United Kingdom"
"High resolution 3D microscopy study of cardiomyocytes on polymer scaffold nanofibers reveals formation of unusual sheathed structure.","Building functional and robust scaffolds for engineered biological tissue requires a nanoscale mechanistic understanding of how cells use the scaffold for their growth and development. A vast majority of the scaffolds used for cardiac tissue engineering are based on polymer materials, the matrices of nanofibers. Attempts to load the polymer fibers of the scaffold with additional sophisticated features, such as electrical conductivity and controlled release of the growth factors or other biologically active molecules, as well as trying to match the mechanical features of the scaffold to those of the extracellular matrix, cannot be efficient without a detailed knowledge of how the cells are attached and strategically positioned with respect to the scaffold nanofibers at micro and nanolevel. Studying single cell - single fiber interactions with the aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning probe nanotomography (SPNT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that cardiac cells actively interact with substrate nanofibers, but in different ways. While cardiomyocytes often create a remarkable &quot;sheath&quot; structure, enveloping fiber and, thus, substantially increasing contact zone, fibroblasts interact with nanofibers in the locations of focal adhesion clusters mainly without wrapping the fiber.We found that cardiomyocytes grown on electrospun polymer nanofibers often create a striking &quot;sheath&quot; structure, enveloping fiber with the formation of a very narrow (¡«22<U+202F>nm) membrane gap leading from the fiber to the extracellular space. This wrapping makes the entire fiber surface available for cell attachment. This finding gives a new prospective view on how scaffold nanofibers may interact with growing cells. It may play a significant role in effective design of novel nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering concerning mechanical and electrical properties of scaffolds as well as controlled drug release from &quot;smart&quot; biomaterials.</AbstractText>: We found that cardiomyocytes grown on electrospun polymer nanofibers often create a striking &quot;sheath&quot; structure, enveloping fiber with the formation of a very narrow (¡«22<U+202F>nm) membrane gap leading from the fiber to the extracellular space.

"A Beginner's Guide to Analyzing and Visualizing Mass Cytometry Data.","Mass cytometry has revolutionized the study of cellular and phenotypic diversity, significantly expanding the number of phenotypic and functional characteristics that can be measured at the single-cell level. This high-dimensional analysis platform has necessitated the development of new data analysis approaches. Many of these algorithms circumvent traditional approaches used in flow cytometric analysis, fundamentally changing the way these data are analyzed and interpreted. For the beginner, however, the large number of algorithms that have been developed, as well as the lack of consensus on best practices for analyzing these data, raise multiple questions: Which algorithm is the best for analyzing a dataset? How do different algorithms compare? How can one move beyond data visualization to gain new biological insights? In this article, we describe our experiences as recent adopters of mass cytometry. By analyzing a single dataset using five cytometry by time-of-flight analysis platforms (viSNE, SPADE, X-shift, PhenoGraph, and Citrus), we identify important considerations and challenges that users should be aware of when using these different methods and common and unique insights that can be revealed by these different methods. By providing annotated workflow and figures, these analyses present a practical guide for investigators analyzing high-dimensional datasets. In total, these analyses emphasize the benefits of integrating multiple cytometry by time-of-flight analysis algorithms to gain complementary insights into these high-dimensional datasets.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","29255085",2017,"United States"

"Effects of early afterdepolarizations on excitation patterns in an accurate model of the human ventricles.","Early Afterdepolarizations, EADs, are defined as the reversal of the action potential before completion of the repolarization phase, which can result in ectopic beats. However, the series of mechanisms of EADs leading to these ectopic beats and related cardiac arrhythmias are not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of this single cell behavior on the whole heart level. For this study we used a modified version of the Ten Tusscher-Panfilov model of human ventricular cells (TP06) which we implemented in a 3D ventricle model including realistic fiber orientations. To increase the likelihood of EAD formation at the single cell level, we reduced the repolarization reserve (RR) by reducing the rapid delayed rectifier Potassium current and raising the L-type Calcium current. Varying these parameters defined a 2D parametric space where different excitation patterns could be classified. Depending on the initial conditions, by either exciting the ventricles with a spiral formation or burst pacing protocol, we found multiple different spatio-temporal excitation patterns. The spiral formation protocol resulted in the categorization of a stable spiral (S), a meandering spiral (MS), a spiral break-up regime (SB), spiral fibrillation type B (B), spiral fibrillation type A (A) and an oscillatory excitation type (O). The last three patterns are a 3D generalization of previously found patterns in 2D. First, the spiral fibrillation type B showed waves determined by a chaotic bi-excitable regime, i.e. mediated by both Sodium and Calcium waves at the same time and in same tissue settings. In the parameter region governed by the B pattern, single cells were able to repolarize completely and different (spiral) waves chaotically burst into each other without finishing a 360 degree rotation. Second, spiral fibrillation type A patterns consisted of multiple small rotating spirals. Single cells failed to repolarize to the resting membrane potential hence prohibiting the Sodium channel gates to recover. Accordingly, we found that Calcium waves mediated these patterns. Third, a further reduction of the RR resulted in a more exotic parameter regime whereby the individual cells behaved independently as oscillators. The patterns arose due to a phase-shift of different oscillators as disconnection of the cells resulted in continuation of the patterns. For all patterns, we computed realistic 9 lead ECGs by including a torso model. The B and A type pattern exposed the behavior of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). We conclude that EADs at the single cell level can result in different types of cardiac fibrillation at the tissue and 3D ventricle level.","PloS one","29216239",2017,"United States"
"Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor-Alpha Expressing Cardiac Progenitor Cells Can Be Derived from Previously Cryopreserved Human Heart Samples.","Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are being developed as a promising treatment for heart failure. Although clinical trials have predominantly used donor cardiac biopsies to derive CPCs, a better solution could be to use previously cryopreserved human heart tissue. This would enable timely and convenient access to healthy and young heart samples for CPC production. However, few studies have attempted to isolate CPCs from previously cryopreserved heart tissue. In this study, we isolated CPCs from eight nondiseased human heart samples previously cryopreserved as part of the Sydney Heart Bank. Resulting cells were strongly positive for known fibroblast (DDR2, Vimentin), mesenchymal/CPC (PDGFR¦Á, CD90) markers, and for pluripotency genes (SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF4), whereas being negative for the pan-hematopoietic marker (CD45). Outgrowth cells from aged hearts had decreased proliferative and self-renewing capacity that correlated with shorter telomere lengths compared with cells from young hearts. No telomerase activity was detected in any cells isolated. Colony-forming assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were used to enrich PDGFR¦Á<sup>+</sup>/CD90<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup> CPCs. Multipotent potential was confirmed using in vitro differentiation assays with smooth muscle (MYH11<sup>+</sup>), endothelial cell (vWF<sup>+</sup>), and cardiomyocyte-like (cTnT<sup>+</sup>, ¦Á-actinin<sup>+</sup>) cell formation. Single cell assays demonstrated clonogenicity of PDGFR¦Á<sup>+</sup> CPCs with maintenance of prolonged self-renewing capacity (&gt;2 months), and pluripotency gene expression at both early and late culture passages. Our results demonstrate that multipotent PDGFR¦Á<sup>+</sup> CPCs can be harvested and expanded from previously banked cryopreserved human heart samples. These data support cardiac tissue banking as a strategy for improved access to CPCs for future clinical therapies.","Stem cells and development","29205098",2017,"United States"
"Evolutionary epistemology: Reviewing and reviving with new data the research programme for distributed biological intelligence.","Numerous studies in microbiology, eukaryotic cell biology, plant biology, biomimetics, synthetic biology, and philosophy of science appear to support the principles of the epistemological theory inspired by evolution, also known as &quot;Evolutionary Epistemology&quot;, or EE. However, that none of the studies acknowledged EE suggests that its principles have not been formulated with sufficient clarity and depth to resonate with the interests of the empirical research community. In this paper I review evidence in favor of EE, and also reformulate EE principles to better inform future research. The revamped programme may be tentatively called Research Programme for Distributed Biological Intelligence. Intelligence I define as the capacity of organisms to gain information about their environment, process that information internally, and translate it into phenotypic forms. This multistage progression may be expressed through the acronym IGPT (information-gain-process-translate). The key principles of the programme may be summarized as follows. (i) Intelligence, a universal biological phenomenon promoting individual fitness, is required for effective organism-environment interactions. Given that animals represent less than 0.01% of the planetary biomass, neural intelligence is not the evolutionary norm. (ii) The basic unit of intelligence is a single cell prokaryote. All other forms of intelligence are derived. (iii) Intelligence is hierarchical. It ranges from bacteria to the biosphere or Gaia. (iv) The concept of &quot;information&quot; acquires a new meaning because information processing is at the heart of biological intelligence. All biological systems, from bacteria to Gaia, are intelligent, open thermodynamic systems that exchange information, matter and energy with the environment. (v) The organism-environment interaction is cybernetic. As much as the organism changes due to the influence of the environment, the organism's responses to induced changes affect the environment and subsequent organism-environment interactions. Based on the above principles a new research agenda can be formulated to explore different forms of biological intelligence.","Bio Systems","29199093",2017,"Ireland"

"Long Non-Coding RNAs in Metabolic Organs and Energy Homeostasis.","Single cell organisms can surprisingly exceed the number of human protein-coding genes, which are thus not at the origin of the complexity of an organism. In contrast, the relative amount of non-protein-coding sequences increases consistently with organismal complexity. Moreover, the mammalian transcriptome predominantly comprises non-(protein)-coding RNAs (ncRNA), of which the long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) constitute the most abundant part. lncRNAs are highly species- and tissue-specific with very versatile modes of action in accordance with their binding to a large spectrum of molecules and their diverse localization. lncRNAs are transcriptional regulators adding an additional regulatory layer in biological processes and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we review lncRNAs affecting metabolic organs with a focus on the liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, brain, and adipose organ. In addition, we will discuss the impact of lncRNAs on metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. In contrast to the substantial number of lncRNA loci in the human genome, the functionally characterized lncRNAs are just the tip of the iceberg. So far, our knowledge concerning lncRNAs in energy homeostasis is still in its infancy, meaning that the rest of the iceberg is a treasure chest yet to be discovered.","International journal of molecular sciences","29189723",2017,"Switzerland"
"Single-Cell Functional Analysis of Stem-Cell Derived Cardiomyocytes on Micropatterned Flexible Substrates.","Human pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) hold great promise for applications in human disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, and, ultimately, regenerative medicine. The ability to study multiple parameters of hPSC-CM function, such as contractile and electrical activity, calcium cycling, and force generation, is therefore of paramount importance. hPSC-CMs cultured on stiff substrates like glass or polystyrene do not have the ability to shorten during contraction, making them less suitable for the study of hPSC-CM contractile function. Other approaches require highly specialized hardware and are difficult to reproduce. Here we describe a protocol for the preparation of hPSC-CMs on soft substrates that enable shortening, and subsequently the simultaneous quantitative analysis of their contractile and electrical activity, calcium cycling, and force generation at single-cell resolution. This protocol requires only affordable and readily available materials and works with standard imaging hardware. <U+00A9> 2017 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","Current protocols in stem cell biology","29140569",2017,"United States"

"Isolation and Characterization of Antigen-Specific Plasmablasts Using a Novel Flow Cytometry-Based Ig Capture Assay.","We report the development of a novel flow cytometry-based Ig capture assay (ICA) for the identification and sorting of individual Ab-secreting cells based on their Ag reactivity. The ICA represents a fast and versatile tool for single-cell sorting of peripheral plasmablasts, streamlining subsequent Ab analysis, and cloning. We demonstrate the utility of the assay by isolating Ag-reactive plasmablasts from cryopreserved PBMC obtained from volunteers vaccinated with a recombinant HIV envelope protein. To show the specificity of the ICA, we produced Ag-specific Abs from these cells and subsequently verified their Ag reactivity via ELISA. Furthermore, we used the ICA to track Ag-specific plasmablast responses in HIV-vaccine recipients over a period of 42 d and performed a head-to-head comparison with a conventional B cell ELISpot. Results were highly comparable, highlighting that this assay is a viable alternative for monitoring Ag-specific plasmablast responses at early time points after infection or vaccination. The ICA provides important added benefits in that phenotypic information can be obtained from the identified Ag-specific cells that can then be captured for downstream applications such as B cell sequencing and/or Ab cloning. We envisage the ICA as being a useful tool in Ab repertoire analysis for future clinical trials.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","29118244",2017,"United Kingdom"
"Functional mutant GATA4 identification and potential application in preimplantation diagnosis of congenital heart diseases.","Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) affect nearly 1% of all neonates and show an increasing tendency. The complex inheritance patterns and multifactorial etiologies make these defects difficult to be identified before complete manifestation. Genetic screening has identified hundreds of specific mutant sites for CHDs based on cardiac transcriptional factors. GATA4 is a master regulator required for ventral morphogenesis and heart tube formation. Its mutation is most widely studied in CHDs. In the past decades, over 100 GATA4 mutant sites have been reported, but only a few functional sites have been identified. Thus, it is important to distinguish deleterious sites from neutral sites. In silico prediction of functional sites using bioinformatics tools can provide the valuable information, but it is not solid enough. Here, the roles of GATA4 in heart development is discussed in detail and its mutation sites in protein coding region are summarized systematically, providing an integrated resource for GATA4 mutations. Furthermore, we discussed the advantage and disadvantage of different methods for functional mutation identification. Especially, the disease model of induced pluripotent stem cell is emerging as a powerful tool to assess GATA4 mutations in human. In the recent years, single-cell based high-throughput sequencing is being applied in preimplantation diagnosis and assisted reproduction progressively, providing a new strategy for the prevention of congenital diseases as we discussed. Based on functional mutant sites identification, preimplantation diagnosis will contribute to CHDs prevention eventually.","Gene","29111206",2017,"Netherlands"
"IRF3 and type I interferons fuel a fatal response to myocardial infarction.","Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and type I interferons (IFNs) protect against infections and cancer, but excessive IRF3 activation and type I IFN production cause autoinflammatory conditions such as Aicardi-Gouti¨¨res syndrome and STING-associated vasculopathy of infancy (SAVI). Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits inflammation, but the dominant molecular drivers of MI-associated inflammation remain unclear. Here we show that ischemic cell death and uptake of cell debris by macrophages in the heart fuel a fatal response to MI by activating IRF3 and type I IFN production. In mice, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 4,215 leukocytes isolated from infarcted and non-infarcted hearts showed that MI provokes activation of an IRF3-interferon axis in a distinct population of interferon-inducible cells (IFNICs) that were classified as cardiac macrophages. Mice genetically deficient in cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), its adaptor STING, IRF3, or the type I IFN receptor IFNAR exhibited impaired interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and, in the case of mice deficient in IRF3 or IFNAR, improved survival after MI as compared to controls. Interruption of IRF3-dependent signaling resulted in decreased cardiac expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration of the heart, as well as in attenuated ventricular dilation and improved cardiac function. Similarly, treatment of mice with an IFNAR-neutralizing antibody after MI ablated the interferon response and improved left ventricular dysfunction and survival. These results identify IRF3 and the type I IFN response as a potential therapeutic target for post-MI cardioprotection.","Nature medicine","29106401",2017,"United States"

"A method to increase reproducibility in adult ventricular myocyte sizing and flow cytometry: Avoiding cell size bias in single cell preparations.","RATIONALE: Flow cytometry (FCM) of ventricular myocytes (VMs) is an emerging technology in adult cardiac research that is challenged by the wide variety of VM shapes and sizes. Cellular variability and cytometer flow cell size can affect cytometer performance. These two factors of variance limit assay validity and reproducibility across laboratories. Washing and filtering of ventricular cells in suspension are routinely done to prevent cell clumping and minimize data variability without the appropriate standardization. We hypothesize that washing and filtering arbitrarily biases towards sampling smaller VMs than what actually exist in the adult heart.OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of washing and filtering on adult ventricular cells for cell sizing and FCM.METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular cardiac cells in single-cell suspension were harvested from New Zealand White rabbits and fixed prior to analysis. Each ventricular sample was aliquoted before washing or filtering through a 40, 70, 100 or 200¦Ìm mesh. The outcomes of the study are VM volume by Coulter Multisizer and light-scatter signatures by FCM. Data are presented as mean¡ÀSD. Myocyte volumes without washing or filtering (NF) served as the &quot;gold standard&quot; within the sample and ranged from 11,017 to 46,926¦Ìm3. Filtering each animal sample through a 200¦Ìm mesh caused no variation in the post-filtration volume (1.01+0.01 fold vs. NF, n = 4 rabbits, p = 0.999) with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (%CV) of &lt;5% for all 4 samples. Filtering each sample through a 40, 70 or 100¦Ìm mesh invariably reduced the post-filtration volume by 41¡À10%, 9.0¡À0.8% and 8.8¡À0.8% respectively (n = 4 rabbits, p&lt;0.0001), and increased the %CV (18% to 1.3%). The high light-scatter signature by FCM, a simple parameter for the identification of ventricular myocytes, was measured after washing and filtering. Washing discarded VMs and filtering cells through a 40 or 100¦Ìm mesh reduced larger VM by 46% or 11% respectively (n = 6 from 2 rabbits, p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: Washing and filtering VM suspensions through meshes 100¦Ìm or less biases myocyte volumes to smaller sizes, excludes larger cells, and increases VM variability. These findings indicate that validity and reproducibility across laboratories can be compromised unless cell preparation is standardized. We propose no wash prior to fixation and a 200¦Ìm mesh for filtrations to provide a reproducible standard for VM studies using FCM.","PloS one","29084228",2017,"United States"
"Dual Biomembrane Force Probe enables single-cell mechanical analysis of signal crosstalk between multiple molecular species.","Conventional approaches for studying receptor-mediated cell signaling, such as the western blot and flow cytometry, are limited in three aspects: 1) The perturbing preparation procedures often alter the molecules from their native state on the cell; 2) Long processing time before the final readout makes it difficult to capture transient signaling events (&lt;1<U+2009>min); 3) The experimental environments are force-free, therefore unable to visualize mechanical signals in real time. In contrast to these methods in biochemistry and cell biology that are usually population-averaged and non-real-time, here we introduce a novel single-cell based nanotool termed dual biomembrane force probe (dBFP). The dBFP provides precise controls and quantitative readouts in both mechanical and chemical terms, which is particularly suited for juxtacrine signaling and mechanosensing studies. Specifically, the dBFP allows us to analyze dual receptor crosstalk by quantifying the spatiotemporal requirements and functional consequences of the up- and down-stream signaling events. In this work, the utility and power of the dBFP has been demonstrated in four important dual receptor systems that play key roles in immunological synapse formation, shear-dependent thrombus formation, and agonist-driven blood clotting.","Scientific reports","29079742",2017,"United States"

"Single-cell transcriptomics reconstructs fate conversion from fibroblast to cardiomyocyte.","Direct lineage conversion offers a new strategy for tissue regeneration and disease modelling. Despite recent success in directly reprogramming fibroblasts into various cell types, the precise changes that occur as fibroblasts progressively convert to the target cell fates remain unclear. The inherent heterogeneity and asynchronous nature of the reprogramming process renders it difficult to study this process using bulk genomic techniques. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to overcome this limitation and analysed global transcriptome changes at early stages during the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms, we identified molecularly distinct subpopulations of cells during reprogramming. We also constructed routes of iCM formation, and delineated the relationship between cell proliferation and iCM induction. Further analysis of global gene expression changes during reprogramming revealed unexpected downregulation of factors involved in mRNA processing and splicing. Detailed functional analysis of the top candidate splicing factor, Ptbp1, revealed that it is a critical barrier for the acquisition of cardiomyocyte-specific splicing patterns in fibroblasts. Concomitantly, Ptbp1 depletion promoted cardiac transcriptome acquisition and increased iCM reprogramming efficiency. Additional quantitative analysis of our dataset revealed a strong correlation between the expression of each reprogramming factor and the progress of individual cells through the reprogramming process, and led to the discovery of new surface markers for the enrichment of iCMs. In summary, our single-cell transcriptomics approaches enabled us to reconstruct the reprogramming trajectory and to uncover intermediate cell populations, gene pathways and regulators involved in iCM induction.","Nature","29072293",2017,"United States"

Then SKM-1/GFP cells were obtained after tumour plaque was separated and cultivated. The cell morphology was observed by fluorescence microscopy. The GFP expression was further detected by flow cytometry. The cell proliferation was analysed by CCK-8 assay. SKM-1/GFP cells were inoculated to subcutaneous tissue of the immunodeficiency mice. The growth and invasion of the tumour were observed after tumour formation.RESULTS: No differences in cell morphology and growth characteristics were observed between SKM-1 cells and SKM-1/GFP cells. The rate of GFP expression was 100%. No differences in cell proliferation were observed between SKM-1 cells and SKM-1/GFP cells. The tumour mass was observed after 14 days of subcutaneous vaccination in NOD/SCID mice. Spontaneous fluorescence from plaque was observed by living fluorescence microscopy at 30th day after vaccination. Homogenous GFP positive cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy in the frozen section of tumour mass. The invasion of SKM-1/GFP cells was also detected in heart, liver, stomach and kidney of mice.CONCLUSION: A myelody-splastic syndrome transformed to leukemia cell line stably expressing green fluorescent protein has been established successfully, which can track tumor cell sensitively and can be applied to the research of minimal residual leukemia. The establishment of SKM-1/GFP cells may serve as a powerful means for studing myelodysplastic syndrome transformation.","Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi","29070130",2017,"China"

"Single-cell RNA-seq reveals a distinct transcriptome signature of aneuploid hematopoietic cells.","Cancer cells frequently exhibit chromosomal abnormalities. Specific cytogenetic aberrations often are predictors of outcome, especially in hematologic neoplasms, such as monosomy 7 in myeloid malignancies. The functional consequences of aneuploidy at the cellular level are difficult to assess because of a lack of convenient markers to distinguish abnormal from diploid cells. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow of 4 healthy donors and 5 patients with bone marrow failure and chromosome gain or loss. In total, transcriptome sequences were obtained from 391 control cells and 588 cells from patients. We characterized normal hematopoiesis as binary differentiation from stem cells to erythroid and myeloid-lymphoid pathways. Aneuploid cells were distinguished from diploid cells in patient samples by computational analyses of read fractions and gene expression of individual chromosomes. We confirmed assignment of aneuploidy to individual cells quantitatively, by copy-number variation, and qualitatively, by loss of heterozygosity. When we projected patients' single cells onto the map of normal hematopoiesis, diverse patterns were observed, broadly reflecting clinical phenotypes. Patients' monosomy 7 cells showed downregulation of genes involved in immune response and DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways, which may contribute to the clonal expansion of monosomy 7 cells with accumulated gene mutations. scRNA-seq is a powerful technique through which to infer the functional consequences of chromosome gain and loss and explore gene targets for directed therapy.","Blood","29030335",2017,"United States"
"Genome-wide mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites in rare cell populations using single-cell DNase sequencing.","Increased chromatin accessibility is a feature of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements; therefore, mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) enables the detection of active regulatory elements of transcription, including promoters, enhancers, insulators and locus-control regions. Single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) is a method of detecting genome-wide DHSs when starting with either single cells or &lt;1,000 cells from primary cell sources. This technique enables genome-wide mapping of hypersensitive sites in a wide range of cell populations that cannot be analyzed using conventional DNase I sequencing because of the requirement for millions of starting cells. Fresh cells, formaldehyde-cross-linked cells or cells recovered from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides are suitable for scDNase-seq assays. To generate scDNase-seq libraries, cells are lysed and then digested with DNase I. Circular carrier plasmid DNA is included during subsequent DNA purification and library preparation steps to prevent loss of the small quantity of DHS DNA. Libraries are generated for high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina platform using standard methods. Preparation of scDNase-seq libraries requires only 2 d. The materials and molecular biology techniques described in this protocol should be accessible to any general molecular biology laboratory. Processing of high-throughput sequencing data requires basic bioinformatics skills and uses publicly available bioinformatics software.","Nature protocols","29022941",2017,"England"

"Impact of sequencing depth and read length on single cell RNA sequencing data of T cells.","Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides great potential in measuring the gene expression profiles of heterogeneous cell populations. In immunology, scRNA-seq allowed the characterisation of transcript sequence diversity of functionally relevant T cell subsets, and the identification of the full length T cell receptor (TCR¦Á¦Â), which defines the specificity against cognate antigens. Several factors, e.g. RNA library capture, cell quality, and sequencing output affect the quality of scRNA-seq data. We studied the effects of read length and sequencing depth on the quality of gene expression profiles, cell type identification, and TCR¦Á¦Â reconstruction, utilising 1,305 single cells from 8 publically available scRNA-seq datasets, and simulation-based analyses. Gene expression was characterised by an increased number of unique genes identified with short read lengths (&lt;50<U+2009>bp), but these featured higher technical variability compared to profiles from longer reads. Successful TCR¦Á¦Â reconstruction was achieved for 6 datasets (81% - 100%) with at least 0.25 millions (PE) reads of length &gt;50<U+2009>bp, while it failed for datasets with &lt;30<U+2009>bp reads. Sufficient read length and sequencing depth can control technical noise to enable accurate identification of TCR¦Á¦Â and gene expression profiles from scRNA-seq data of T cells.","Scientific reports","28986563",2017,"England"
"Thyroid and Glucocorticoid Hormones Promote Functional T-Tubule Development in Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.","RATIONALE: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are increasingly being used for modeling heart disease and are under development for regeneration of the injured heart. However, incomplete structural and functional maturation of hiPSC-CM, including lack of T-tubules, immature excitation-contraction coupling, and inefficient Ca-induced Ca release remain major limitations.OBJECTIVE: Thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones are critical for heart maturation. We hypothesized that their addition to standard protocols would promote T-tubule development and mature excitation-contraction coupling of hiPSC-CM when cultured on extracellular matrix with physiological stiffness (Matrigel mattress).METHODS AND RESULTS: hiPSC-CM were generated using a standard chemical differentiation method supplemented with T3 (triiodothyronine) and/or Dex (dexamethasone) during days 16 to 30 followed by single-cell culture for 5 days on Matrigel mattress. hiPSC-CM treated with T3+Dex, but not with either T3 or Dex alone, developed an extensive T-tubule network. Notably, Matrigel mattress was necessary for T-tubule formation. Compared with adult human ventricular cardiomyocytes, T-tubules in T3+Dex-treated hiPSC-CM were less organized and had more longitudinal elements. Confocal line scans demonstrated spatially and temporally uniform Ca release that is characteristic of excitation-contraction coupling in the heart ventricle. T3+Dex enhanced elementary Ca release measured by Ca sparks and promoted RyR2 (ryanodine receptor) structural organization. Simultaneous measurements of L-type Ca current and intracellular Ca release confirmed enhanced functional coupling between L-type Ca channels and RyR2 in T3+Dex-treated cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a permissive role of combined thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones during the cardiac differentiation process, which when coupled with further maturation on Matrigel mattress, is sufficient for T-tubule development, enhanced Ca-induced Ca release, and more ventricular-like excitation-contraction coupling. This new hormone maturation method could advance the use of hiPSC-CM for disease modeling and cell-based therapy.","Circulation research","28974554",2017,"United States"
"Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction.","BACKGROUND: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.METHODS: Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.","Circulation","28974519",2017,"United States"

"Constant DI pacing suppresses cardiac alternans formation in numerical cable models.","Cardiac repolarization alternans describe the sequential alternation of the action potential duration (APD) and can develop during rapid pacing. In the ventricles, such alternans may rapidly turn into life risking arrhythmias under conditions of spatial heterogeneity. Thus, suppression of alternans by artificial pacing protocols, or alternans control, has been the subject of numerous theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies. Yet, previous attempts that were inspired by chaos control theories were successful only for a short spatial extent (&lt;2<U+2009>cm) from the pacing electrode. Previously, we demonstrated in a single cell model that pacing with a constant diastolic interval (DI) can suppress the formation of alternans at high rates of activation. We attributed this effect to the elimination of feedback between the pacing cycle length and the last APD, effectively preventing restitution-dependent alternans from developing. Here, we extend this idea into cable models to study the extent by which constant DI pacing can control alternans during wave propagation conditions. Constant DI pacing was applied to ventricular cable models of up to 5<U+2009>cm, using human kinetics. Our results show that constant DI pacing significantly shifts the onset of both cardiac alternans and conduction blocks to higher pacing rates in comparison to pacing with constant cycle length. We also demonstrate that constant DI pacing reduces the propensity of spatially discordant alternans, a precursor of wavebreaks. We finally found that the protective effect of constant DI pacing is stronger for increased electrotonic coupling along the fiber in the sense that the onset of alternans is further shifted to higher activation rates. Overall, these results support the potential clinical applicability of such type of pacing in improving protocols of implanted pacemakers, in order to reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Future research should be conducted in order to experimentally validate these promising results.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)","28964144",2017,"United States"
"Theory of the development of alternans in the heart during controlled diastolic interval pacing.","The beat-to-beat alternation in action potential durations (APDs) in the heart, called APD alternans, has been linked to the development of serious cardiac rhythm disorders, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The length of the period between action potentials, called the diastolic interval (DI), is a key dynamical variable in the standard theory of alternans development. Thus, methods that control the DI may be useful in preventing dangerous cardiac rhythms. In this study, we examine the dynamics of alternans during controlled-DI pacing using a series of single-cell and one-dimensional (1D) fiber models of alternans dynamics. We find that a model that combines a so-called memory model with a calcium cycling model can reasonably explain two key experimental results: the possibility of alternans during constant-DI pacing and the phase lag of APDs behind DIs during sinusoidal-DI pacing. We also find that these results can be replicated by incorporating the memory model into an amplitude equation description of a 1D fiber. The 1D fiber result is potentially concerning because it seems to suggest that constant-DI control of alternans can only be effective over only a limited region in space.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)","28964128",2017,"United States"
"Spontaneous, local diastolic subsarcolemmal calcium releases in single, isolated guinea-pig sinoatrial nodal cells.","Uptake and release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (dubbed &quot;calcium clock&quot;), in the form of spontaneous, rhythmic, local diastolic calcium releases (LCRs), together with voltage-sensitive ion channels (membrane clock) form a coupled system that regulates the action potential (AP) firing rate. LCRs activate Sodium/Calcium exchanger (NCX) that accelerates diastolic depolarization and thus participating in regulation of the time at which the next AP will occur. Previous studies in rabbit SA node cells (SANC) demonstrated that the basal AP cycle length (APCL) is tightly coupled to the basal LCR period (time from the prior AP-induced Ca2+ transient to the diastolic LCR occurrence), and that this coupling is further modulated by autonomic receptor stimulation. Although spontaneous LCRs during diastolic depolarization have been reported in SANC of various species (rabbit, cat, mouse, toad), prior studies have failed to detect LCRs in spontaneously beating SANC of guinea-pig, a species that has been traditionally used in studies of cardiac pacemaker cell function. We performed a detailed investigation of whether guinea-pig SANC generate LCRs and whether they play a similar key role in regulation of the AP firing rate. We used two different approaches, 2D high-speed camera and classical line-scan confocal imaging. Positioning the scan-line beneath sarcolemma, parallel to the long axis of the cell, we found that rhythmically beating guinea-pig SANC do, indeed, generate spontaneous, diastolic LCRs beneath the surface membrane. The average key LCR characteristics measured in confocal images in guinea-pig SANC were comparable to rabbit SANC, both in the basal state and in the presence of ¦Â-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Moreover, the relationship between the LCR period and APCL was subtended by the same linear function. Thus, LCRs in guinea-pig SANC contribute to the diastolic depolarization and APCL regulation. Our findings indicate that coupled-clock system regulation of APCL is a general, species-independent, mechanism of pacemaker cell normal automaticity. Lack of LCRs in prior studies is likely explained by technical issues, as individual LCRs are small stochastic events occurring mainly near the cell border.","PloS one","28945810",2017,"United States"
"CTCF-Mediated Enhancer-Promoter Interaction Is a Critical Regulator of Cell-to-Cell Variation of Gene Expression.","Recent studies indicate that even a homogeneous population of cells display heterogeneity in gene expression and response to environmental stimuli. Although promoter structure critically influences the cell-to-cell variation of gene expression in bacteria and lower eukaryotes, it remains unclear what controls the gene expression noise in mammals. Here we report that CTCF decreases cell-to-cell variation of expression by stabilizing enhancer-promoter interaction. We show that CTCF binding sites are interwoven with enhancers within topologically associated domains (TADs) and a positive correlation is found between CTCF binding and the activity of the associated enhancers. Deletion of CTCF sites compromises enhancer-promoter interactions. Using single-cell flow cytometry and single-molecule RNA-FISH assays, we demonstrate that knocking down of CTCF or deletion of a CTCF binding site results in increased cell-to-cell variation of gene expression, indicating that long-range promoter-enhancer interaction mediated by CTCF plays important roles in controlling the cell-to-cell variation of gene expression in mammalian cells.","Molecular cell","28938092",2017,"United States"
"Optogenetic targeting of cardiac myocytes and non-myocytes: Tools, challenges and utility.","In optogenetics, light-activated proteins are used to monitor and modulate cellular behaviour with light. Combining genetic targeting of distinct cellular populations with defined patterns of optical stimulation enables one to study specific cell classes in complex biological tissues. In the current study we attempted to investigate the functional relevance of heterocellular electrotonic coupling in cardiac tissue in situ. In order to do that, we used a Cre-Lox approach to express the light-gated cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) specifically in either cardiac myocytes or non-myocytes. Despite high specificity when using the same Cre driver lines in a previous study in combination with a different optogenetic probe, we found patchy off-target ChR2 expression in cryo-sections and extended z-stack imaging through the ventricular wall of hearts cleared using CLARITY. Based on immunohistochemical analysis, single-cell electrophysiological recordings and whole-genome sequencing, we reason that non-specificity is caused on the Cre recombination level. Our study highlights the importance of careful design and validation of the Cre recombination targets for reliable cell class specific expression of optogenetic tools.","Progress in biophysics and molecular biology","28919131",2017,"United Kingdom"

"Cardiomyocyte-Specific Telomere Shortening is a Distinct Signature of Heart Failure in Humans.","BACKGROUND: Telomere defects are thought to play a role in cardiomyopathies, but the specific cell type affected by the disease in human hearts is not yet identified. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the cell type specificity of telomere shortening in patients with heart failure in relation to their cardiac disease, age, and sex.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied cardiac tissues from patients with heart failure by utilizing telomere quantitative fluorescence in<U+00A0>situ hybridization, a highly sensitive method with single-cell resolution. In this study, total of 63 human left ventricular samples, including 37 diseased and 26 nonfailing donor hearts, were stained for telomeres in combination with cardiomyocyte- or ¦Á-smooth muscle cell-specific markers, cardiac troponin T, and smooth muscle actin, respectively, and assessed for telomere length. Patients with heart failure demonstrate shorter cardiomyocyte telomeres compared with nonfailing donors, which is specific only to cardiomyocytes within diseased human hearts and is associated with cardiomyocyte DNA damage. Our data further reveal that hypertrophic hearts with reduced ejection fraction exhibit the shortest telomeres. In contrast to other reported cell types, no difference in cardiomyocyte telomere length is evident with age. However, under the disease state, telomere attrition manifests in both young and older patients with cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte-telomere length is better sustained in women than men under diseased conditions.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of cardiomyocyte-specific telomere shortening in heart failure.","Journal of the American Heart Association","28882819",2017,"England"
"Opsin 3 and 4 mediate light-induced pulmonary vasorelaxation that is potentiated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 inhibition.","We recently demonstrated that blue light induces vasorelaxation in the systemic mouse circulation, a phenomenon mediated by the nonvisual G protein-coupled receptor melanopsin (Opsin 4; Opn4). Here we tested the hypothesis that nonvisual opsins mediate photorelaxation in the pulmonary circulation. We discovered Opsin 3 (Opn3), Opn4, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in rat pulmonary arteries (PAs) and in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), where the opsins interact directly with GRK2, as demonstrated with a proximity ligation assay. Light elicited an intensity-dependent relaxation of PAs preconstricted with phenylephrine (PE), with a maximum response between 400 and 460 nm (blue light). Wavelength-specific photorelaxation was attenuated in PAs from Opn4<sup>-/-</sup> mice and further reduced following shRNA-mediated knockdown of Opn3. Inhibition of GRK2 amplified the response and prevented physiological desensitization to repeated light exposure. Blue light also prevented PE-induced constriction in isolated PAs, decreased basal tone, ablated PE-induced single-cell contraction of PASMCs, and reversed PE-induced depolarization in PASMCs when GRK2 was inhibited. The photorelaxation response was modulated by soluble guanylyl cyclase but not by protein kinase G or nitric oxide. Most importantly, blue light induced significant vasorelaxation of PAs from rats with chronic pulmonary hypertension and effectively lowered pulmonary arterial pressure in isolated intact perfused rat lungs subjected to acute hypoxia. These findings show that functional Opn3 and Opn4 in PAs represent an endogenous &quot;optogenetic system&quot; that mediates photorelaxation in the pulmonary vasculature. Phototherapy in conjunction with GRK2 inhibition could therefore provide an alternative treatment strategy for pulmonary vasoconstrictive disorders.","American journal of physiology.

"Caveolae in Rabbit Ventricular Myocytes: Distribution and Dynamic Diminution after Cell<U+00A0>Isolation.","Caveolae are signal transduction centers, yet their subcellular distribution and preservation in cardiac myocytes after cell isolation are not well documented. Here, we quantify caveolae located within 100<U+00A0>nm of the outer cell surface membrane in rabbit single-ventricular cardiomyocytes over 8<U+00A0>h post-isolation and relate this to the presence of caveolae in intact tissue. Hearts from New Zealand white rabbits were either chemically fixed by coronary perfusion or enzymatically digested to isolate ventricular myocytes, which were subsequently fixed at 0, 3, and 8<U+00A0>h post-isolation. In live cells, the patch-clamp technique was used to measure whole-cell plasma membrane capacitance, and in fixed cells, caveolae were quantified by transmission electron microscopy. Changes in cell-surface topology were assessed using scanning electron microscopy. In fixed ventricular myocardium, dual-axis electron tomography was used for three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis of caveolae in<U+00A0>situ. The presence and distribution of surface-sarcolemmal caveolae in freshly isolated cells matches that of intact myocardium. With time, the number of surface-sarcolemmal caveolae decreases in isolated cardiomyocytes. This is associated with a gradual increase in whole-cell membrane capacitance. Concurrently, there is a significant increase in area, diameter, and circularity of sub-sarcolemmal mitochondria, indicative of swelling. In addition, electron tomography data from intact heart illustrate the regular presence of caveolae not only at the surface sarcolemma, but also on transverse-tubular membranes in ventricular myocardium. Thus, caveolae are dynamic structures, present both at surface-sarcolemmal and transverse-tubular membranes. After cell isolation, the number of surface-sarcolemmal caveolae decreases significantly within a time frame relevant for single-cell research. The concurrent increase in cell capacitance suggests that membrane incorporation of surface-sarcolemmal caveolae underlies this, but internalization and/or micro-vesicle loss to the extracellular space may also contribute. Given that much of the research into cardiac caveolae-dependent signaling utilizes isolated cells, and since caveolae-dependent pathways matter for a wide range of other study targets, analysis of isolated cell data should take the time post-isolation into account.","Biophysical journal","28877488",2017,"United States"

We searched the literature, including PubMed and individual references for publications of original articles, single cases, or case series of paediatric fungal endocarditis, with the following keywords: &quot;fungal endocarditis&quot;, &quot;neonates&quot;, &quot;infants&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, and &quot;cardiac vegetation&quot;.RESULTS: There have been 192 documented cases of fungal endocarditis in paediatrics. The highest number of cases was reported in infants (93/192, 48%) including 60 in neonates. Of the neonatal cases, 57 were premature with a median gestational age of 27 weeks and median birth weight of 860 g. Overall, 120 yeast - fungus that grows as a single cell - infections and 43 mould - fungus that grows in multicellular filaments, hyphae - infections were reported. With increasing age, there was an increased infection rate with moulds. All the yeast infections were detected by blood culture. In cases with mould infection, diagnosis was mainly established by culture or histology of emboli or infected valves after invasive surgical procedures. There have been a few recent cases of successful early diagnosis by non-invasive methods such as blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for moulds. The overall mortality for paediatric fungal endocarditis was 56.25%. The most important cause of death was cardiac complications due to heart failure. Among the various treatment regimens used, none of them was significantly associated with better outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive methods such as PCR tests can be used to improve the chances of detecting and identifying the aetiological agent in a timely manner. Delays in the diagnosis of these infections may result in high mortality and morbidity. No significant difference was noted between combined surgical and medical therapy over exclusively combined medical therapy.","Cardiology in the young","28857727",2017,"England"

"LungMAP: The Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program.","The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is funding an effort to create a molecular atlas of the developing lung (LungMAP) to serve as a research resource and public education tool. The lung is a complex organ with lengthy development time driven by interactive gene networks and dynamic cross talk among multiple cell types to control and coordinate lineage specification, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, morphogenesis, and injury repair. A better understanding of the processes that regulate lung development, particularly alveologenesis, will have a significant impact on survival rates for premature infants born with incomplete lung development and will facilitate lung injury repair and regeneration in adults. A consortium of four research centers, a data coordinating center, and a human tissue repository provides high-quality molecular data of developing human and mouse lungs. LungMAP includes mouse and human data for cross correlation of developmental processes across species.

"Single cell qPCR reveals that additional HAND2 and microRNA-1 facilitate the early reprogramming progress of seven-factor-induced human myocytes.","The direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte (CM)-like cells (iCMs) holds great promise in restoring heart function. We previously found that human fibroblasts could be reprogrammed toward CM-like cells by 7 reprogramming factors; however, iCM reprogramming in human fibroblasts is both more difficult and more time-intensive than that in mouse cells. In this study, we investigated if additional reprogramming factors could quantitatively and/or qualitatively improve 7-factor-mediated human iCM reprogramming by single-cell quantitative PCR. We first validated 46 pairs of TaqMan<U+00AE> primers/probes that had sufficient efficiency and sensitivity to detect the significant difference of gene expression between individual H9 human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-differentiated CMs (H9CMs) and human fibroblasts. The expression profile of these 46 genes revealed an improved reprogramming in 12-week iCMs compared to 4-week iCMs reprogrammed by 7 factors, indicating a prolonged stochastic phase during human iCM reprogramming. Although none of additional one reprogramming factor yielded a greater number of iCMs, our single-cell qPCR revealed that additional HAND2 or microRNA-1 could facilitate the silencing of fibroblast genes and yield a better degree of reprogramming in more reprogrammed iCMs. Noticeably, the more HAND2 expressed, the higher-level were cardiac genes activated in 7Fs+HAND2-reprogrammed iCMs. In conclusion, HAND2 and microRNA-1 could help 7 factors to facilitate the early progress of iCM-reprogramming from human fibroblasts. Our study provides valuable information to further optimize a method of direct iCM-reprogramming in human cells.","PloS one","28796841",2017,"United States"
"Human lymphoid organ dendritic cell identity is predominantly dictated by ontogeny, not tissue microenvironment.","In mice, conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) derive from separate hematopoietic precursors before they migrate to peripheral tissues. Moreover, two classes of conventional DCs (cDC1 and cDC2 DCs) and one class of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have been shown to be transcriptionally and functionally distinct entities. In humans, these three DC subtypes can be identified using the cell surface markers CD1c (cDC2), CD141 (cDC1), and CD303 (pDCs), albeit it remains elusive whether DC functionality is mainly determined by ontogeny or the tissue microenvironment. By phenotypic and transcriptional profiling of these three DC subtypes in different human tissues derived from a large number of human individuals, we demonstrate that DC subpopulations in organs of the lymphohematopoietic system (spleen, thymus, and blood) are strongly defined by ontogeny rather than by signals from the microenvironment. In contrast, DC subsets derived from human lung or skin differed substantially, strongly arguing that DCs react toward modulatory signals from tissue microenvironments. Collectively, the data obtained in this study may serve as a major resource to guide further studies into human DC biology during homeostasis and inflammation.","Science immunology","28783692",2017,"United States"

"High resolution 3-Dimensional imaging of the human cardiac conduction system from microanatomy to mathematical modeling.","Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are accompanied by structural remodelling of the specialised cardiomyocytes known collectively as the cardiac conduction system. Here, using contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography, we present, in attitudinally appropriate fashion, the first 3-dimensional representations of the cardiac conduction system within the intact human heart. We show that cardiomyocyte orientation can be extracted from these datasets at spatial resolutions approaching the single cell. These data show that commonly accepted anatomical representations are oversimplified. We have incorporated the high-resolution anatomical data into mathematical simulations of cardiac electrical depolarisation. The data presented should have multidisciplinary impact. Since the rate of depolarisation is dictated by cardiac microstructure, and the precise orientation of the cardiomyocytes, our data should improve the fidelity of mathematical models. By showing the precise 3-dimensional relationships between the cardiac conduction system and surrounding structures, we provide new insights relevant to valvar replacement surgery and ablation therapies. We also offer a practical method for investigation of remodelling in disease, and thus, virtual pathology and archiving. Such data presented as 3D images or 3D printed models, will inform discussions between medical teams and their patients, and aid the education of medical and surgical trainees.","Scientific reports","28775383",2017,"United Kingdom"

"Single-cell profiling reveals GPCR heterogeneity and functional patterning during neuroinflammation.","GPCR expression was intensively studied in bulk cDNA of leukocyte populations, but limited data are available with respect to expression in individual cells. Here, we show a microfluidic-based single-cell GPCR expression analysis in primary T cells, myeloid cells, and endothelial cells under naive conditions and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We found that neuroinflammation induces characteristic changes in GPCR heterogeneity and patterning, and we identify various functionally relevant subgroups with specific GPCR profiles among spinal cord-infiltrating CD4 T cells, macrophages, microglia, or endothelial cells. Using GPCRs CXCR4, S1P1, and LPHN2 as examples, we show how this information can be used to develop new strategies for the functional modulation of Th17 cells and activated endothelial cells. Taken together, single-cell GPCR expression analysis identifies functionally relevant subpopulations with specific GPCR repertoires and provides a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies in immune disorders.","JCI insight","28768912",2017,"United States"
"Tissue-Level Cardiac Electrophysiology Studied in Murine Myocardium Using a Microelectrode Array: Autonomic and Thermal Modulation.","Cardiac electrophysiology is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, and this has both pathophysiological, and possibly therapeutic importance. Furthermore, chamber differences in electrophysiology exist between atria and ventricles, yet there have been few direct comparisons. There is substantial literature on ion channel modulation at the single-cell level but less work on how this affects tissue-level parameters. We used a microelectrode array system to explore these issues using murine atrial and ventricular tissue slices. Activation time, conduction velocity and repolarisation were measured, and their modulation by temperature and pharmacological autonomic agonists were assessed. The system recorded reliable measurements under control conditions in the absence of drug/thermal challenge, and significant baseline differences were found in chamber electrophysiology. The sodium channel blocker mexiletine, produced large magnitude changes in all three measured parameters. Carbachol and isoprenaline induced differing effects in atria and ventricles, whereas temperature produced similar effects on activation and repolarisation.","The Journal of membrane biology","28766006",2017,"United Kingdom"
"Adventitial SCA-1<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cell Gene Sequencing Reveals the Mechanisms of Cell Migration in Response to Hyperlipidemia.","Adventitial progenitor cells, including SCA-1<sup>+</sup> and mesenchymal stem cells, are believed to be important in vascular remodeling. It has been shown that SCA-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells are involved in neointimal hyperplasia of vein grafts, but little is known concerning their involvement in hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis. We employed single-cell sequencing technology on primary adventitial mouse SCA-1<sup>+</sup> cells from wild-type and atherosclerotic-prone (ApoE-deficient) mice and found that a group of genes controlling cell migration and matrix protein degradation was highly altered. Adventitial progenitors from ApoE-deficient mice displayed an augmented migratory potential both in<U+00A0>vitro and in<U+00A0>vivo. This increased migratory ability was mimicked by lipid loading to SCA-1<sup>+</sup> cells. Furthermore, we show that lipid loading increased miRNA-29b expression and induced sirtuin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels to promote cell migration. These results provide direct evidence that blood cholesterol levels influence vascular progenitor cell function, which could be a potential target cell for treatment of vascular disease.","Stem cell reports","28757161",2017,"United Kingdom"

"Comparison of Non-Coding RNAs in Exosomes and Functional Efficacy of Human Embryonic Stem Cell- versus Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.","Both human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (iPSC-CMs) can serve as unlimited cell sources for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, the functional equivalency between human ESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs for cardiac regenerative therapy has not been demonstrated. Here, we performed a head-to-head comparison of ESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs in their ability to restore cardiac function in a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model as well as their exosomal secretome. Human ESCs and iPSCs were differentiated into CMs using small molecule inhibitors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirmed ¡«85% and ¡«83% of CMs differentiated from ESCs and iPSCs, respectively, were positive for cardiac troponin T. At a single-cell level, both cell types displayed similar calcium handling and electrophysiological properties, with gene expression comparable with the human fetal heart marked by striated sarcomeres. Sub-acute transplantation of ESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs into nude rats post-MI improved cardiac function, which was associated with increased expression of angiogenic genes in vitro following hypoxia. Profiling of exosomal microRNAs (miRs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) revealed that both groups contain an identical repertoire of miRs and lncRNAs, including some that are known to be cardioprotective. We demonstrate that both ESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs can facilitate comparable cardiac repair. This is advantageous because, unlike allogeneic ESC-CMs used in therapy, autologous iPSC-CMs could potentially avoid immune rejection when used for cardiac cell transplantation in the future.

"Biophysical and biomolecular determination of cellular age in humans.","Ageing research has focused either on assessing organ- and tissue-based changes, such as lung capacity and cardiac function, or on changes at the molecular scale such as gene expression, epigenetic modifications and metabolism. Here, by using a cohort of 32 samples of primary dermal fibroblasts collected from individuals between 2 and 96 years of age, we show that the degradation of functional cellular biophysical features-including cell mechanics, traction strength, morphology and migratory potential-and associated descriptors of cellular heterogeneity predict cellular age with higher accuracy than conventional biomolecular markers. We also demonstrate the use of high-throughput single-cell technologies, together with a deterministic model based on cellular features, to compute the cellular age of apparently healthy males and females, and to explore these relationships in cells from individuals with Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, two rare genetic conditions that result in phenotypes that show aspects of premature ageing. Our findings suggest that the quantification of cellular age may be used to stratify individuals on the basis of cellular phenotypes and serve as a biological proxy of healthspan.","Nature biomedical engineering","31372309",2017,"United States"
"MARK4 regulates NLRP3 positioning and inflammasome activation through a microtubule-dependent mechanism.","Excessive activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in many chronic inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) binds to NLRP3 and drives it to the microtubule-organizing centre, enabling the formation of one large inflammasome speck complex within a single cell. MARK4 knockdown or knockout, or disruption of MARK4-NLRP3 interaction, impairs NLRP3 spatial arrangement and limits inflammasome activation. Our results demonstrate how an evolutionarily conserved protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics orchestrates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by controlling its transport to optimal activation sites, and identify a targetable function for MARK4 in the control of innate immunity.","Nature communications","28656979",2017,"United Kingdom"

"In silico assessment of the effects of quinidine, disopyramide and E-4031 on short QT syndrome variant 1 in the human ventricles.","AIMS: Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is an inherited disorder associated with abnormally abbreviated QT intervals and an increased incidence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. SQT1 variant (linked to the rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel current, IKr) of SQTS, results from an inactivation-attenuated, gain-of-function mutation (N588K) in the KCNH2-encoded potassium channels. Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of SQT1 have been well characterized, but less is known about the possible pharmacological antiarrhythmic treatment of SQT1. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the potential effects of E-4031, disopyramide and quinidine on SQT1 using a mathematical model of human ventricular electrophysiology.METHODS: The ten Tusscher et al. biophysically detailed model of the human ventricular action potential (AP) was modified to incorporate IKr Markov chain (MC) formulations based on experimental data of the kinetics of the N588K mutation of the KCNH2-encoded subunit of the IKr channels. The modified ventricular cell model was then integrated into one-dimensional (1D) strand, 2D regular and realistic tissues with transmural heterogeneities. The channel-blocking effect of the drugs on ion currents in healthy and SQT1 cells was modeled using half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and Hill coefficient (nH) values from literatures. Effects of drugs on cell AP duration (APD), effective refractory period (ERP) and pseudo-ECG traces were calculated. Effects of drugs on the ventricular temporal and spatial vulnerability to re-entrant excitation waves were measured. Re-entry was simulated in both 2D regular and realistic ventricular tissue.RESULTS: At the single cell level, the drugs E-4031 and disopyramide had hardly noticeable effects on the ventricular cell APD at 90% repolarization (APD90), whereas quinidine caused a significant prolongation of APD90. Quinidine prolonged and decreased the maximal transmural AP heterogeneity (¦ÄV); this led to the decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD across the 1D strand. Quinidine caused QT prolongation and a decrease in the T-wave amplitude, and increased ERP and decreased temporal susceptibility of the tissue to the initiation of re-entry and increased the minimum substrate size necessary to prevent re-entry in the 2D regular model, and further terminated re-entrant waves in the 2D realistic model. Quinidine exhibited significantly better therapeutic effects on SQT1 than E-4031 and disopyramide.CONCLUSIONS: The simulated pharmacological actions of quinidine exhibited antiarrhythmic effects on SQT1. This study substantiates a causal link between quinidine and QT interval prolongation in SQT1 and suggests that quinidine may be a potential pharmacological agent for treating SQT1 patients.","PloS one","28632743",2017,"United States"
"Single-cell profiling reveals heterogeneity and functional patterning of GPCR expression in the vascular system.","G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expression is extensively studied in bulk cDNA, but heterogeneity and functional patterning of GPCR expression in individual vascular cells is poorly understood. Here, we perform a microfluidic-based single-cell GPCR expression analysis in primary smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (EC). GPCR expression is highly heterogeneous in all cell types, which is confirmed in reporter mice, on the protein level and in human cells. Inflammatory activation in murine models of sepsis or atherosclerosis results in characteristic changes in the GPCR repertoire, and we identify functionally relevant subgroups of cells that are characterized by specific GPCR patterns. We further show that dedifferentiating SMC upregulate GPCRs such as Gpr39, Gprc5b, Gprc5c or Gpr124, and that selective targeting of Gprc5b modulates their differentiation state. Taken together, single-cell profiling identifies receptors expressed on pathologically relevant subpopulations and provides a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies in vascular diseases.","Nature communications","28621310",2017,"England"

"Mono-Heteromeric Configurations of Gap Junction Channels Formed by Connexin43 and Connexin45 Reduce Unitary Conductance and Determine both Voltage Gating and Metabolic Flux Asymmetry.","In cardiac tissues, the expression of multiple connexins (Cx40, Cx43, Cx45, and Cx30.2) is a requirement for proper development and function. Gap junctions formed by these connexins have distinct permeability and gating mechanisms. Since a single cell can express more than one connexin isoform, the formation of hetero-multimeric gap junction channels provides a tissue with an enormous repertoire of combinations to modulate intercellular communication. To study further the perm-selectivity and gating properties of channels containing Cx43 and Cx45, we studied two monoheteromeric combinations in which a HeLa cell co-transfected with Cx43 and Cx45 was paired with a cell expressing only one of these connexins. Macroscopic measurements of total conductance between cell pairs indicated a drastic reduction in total conductance for mono-heteromeric channels. In terms of Vj dependent gating, Cx43 homomeric connexons facing heteromeric connexons only responded weakly to voltage negativity. Cx45 homomeric connexons exhibited no change in Vj gating when facing heteromeric connexons. The distributions of unitary conductances (¦Ãj) for both mono-heteromeric channels were smaller than predicted, and both showed low permeability to the fluorescent dyes Lucifer yellow and Rhodamine123. For both mono-heteromeric channels, we observed flux asymmetry regardless of dye charge: flux was higher in the direction of the heteromeric connexon for MhetCx45 and in the direction of the homomeric Cx43 connexon for MhetCx43. Thus, our data suggest that co-expression of Cx45 and Cx43 induces the formation of heteromeric connexons with greatly reduced permeability and unitary conductance. Furthermore, it increases the asymmetry for voltage gating for opposing connexons, and it favors asymmetric flux of molecules across the junction that depends primarily on the size (not the charge) of the crossing molecules.","Frontiers in physiology","28611680",2017,"Switzerland"
"Effects of amiodarone on short QT syndrome variant 3 in human ventricles: a simulation study.","RESULTS: Amiodarone prolonged the ventricular cell APD and decreased the maximal voltage heterogeneity (¦ÄV) among three difference cells types across transmural ventricular wall, leading to a decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD along a 1D model of ventricular transmural strand. Amiodarone increased cellular ERP, prolonged QT interval and decreased the T-wave amplitude. It reduced tissue's temporal susceptibility to the initiation of re-entry and increased the minimum substrate size necessary to sustain re-entry in the 2D tissue.CONCLUSIONS: At the therapeutic-relevant concentration of amiodarone, the APD and ERP at the single cell level were increased significantly. The QT interval in pseudo-ECG was prolonged and the re-entry in tissue was prevented. This study provides further evidence that amiodarone may be a potential pharmacological agent for preventing arrhythmogenesis for SQT3 patients.","Biomedical engineering online","28592292",2017,"England"

Three-dimensional (3-D) culture is a better mimic of the natural niche for stem cells and is widely used for disease modeling. Here, we describe a nonaggregate culture system of human embryonic stem cells inside electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber scaffolds combined with defined extracellular proteins naturally occurring in the stem cell niche. PCL fiber scaffolds coated with recombinant human laminin-521 readily supported initial stem cell attachment and growth from a single-cell suspension. The combination of recombinant E-cadherin-Fc and laminin-521 further improved cell dispersion rendering a uniform cell population.

"Electro-mechanical dynamics of spiral waves in a discrete 2D model of human atrial tissue.","We investigate the effect of mechano-electrical feedback and atrial fibrillation induced electrical remodelling (AFER) of cellular ion channel properties on the dynamics of spiral waves in a discrete 2D model of human atrial tissue. The tissue electro-mechanics are modelled using the discrete element method (DEM). Millions of bonded DEM particles form a network of coupled atrial cells representing 2D cardiac tissue, allowing simulations of the dynamic behaviour of electrical excitation waves and mechanical contraction in the tissue. In the tissue model, each cell is modelled by nine particles, accounting for the features of individual cellular geometry; and discrete inter-cellular spatial arrangement of cells is also considered. The electro-mechanical model of a human atrial single-cell was constructed by strongly coupling the electrophysiological model of Colman et al. to the mechanical myofilament model of Rice et al., with parameters modified based on experimental data. A stretch-activated channel was incorporated into the model to simulate the mechano-electrical feedback. In order to investigate the effect of mechano-electrical feedback on the dynamics of spiral waves, simulations of spiral waves were conducted in both the electromechanical model and the electrical-only model in normal and AFER conditions, to allow direct comparison of the results between the models. Dynamics of spiral waves were characterized by tracing their tip trajectories, stability, excitation frequencies and meandering range of tip trajectories. It was shown that the developed DEM method provides a stable and efficient model of human atrial tissue with considerations of the intrinsically discrete and anisotropic properties of the atrial tissue, which are challenges to handle in traditional continuum mechanics models. This study provides mechanistic insights into the complex behaviours of spiral waves and the genesis of atrial fibrillation by showing an important role of the mechano-electrical feedback in facilitating and promoting atrial fibrillation.","PloS one","28510575",2017,"United Kingdom"
"The genotoxic effect of oxcarbazepine on mice blood lymphocytes.","This study was conducted to assess the amount of DNA damage caused by Oxcarbazepine (OXC) through single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) technique/comet assay. OXC derived from dibenzazepine series is an effective second generation antiepileptic drug (AED) for both children and adults. Side effects like genotoxic effects of AEDs are of prime importance resulting from toxic metabolites, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Forty Eight adult male Bagg's albino mice (BALB/c) were randomly classified into eight groups, each comprising of six animals. Two of these groups were control and six were tested groups. Control groups were injected with 1% tween 80 while tested groups were injected with 10, 20, and 40<U+2009>mg/kg-day OXC for seven days (acute therapy) and 28<U+00A0>days (subchronic therapy) in peritoneal cavity. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture and subjected to comet assay for the analysis of DNA damage. Per sample 100 cells were scored and classified according to comet tail length. The results showed that OXC in acute and long term therapies had significantly higher (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) genotoxicity in treated groups as compared to control groups. Our study suggests that OXC may cause significant DNA damage in both acute as well as in subchronic therapies.","Drug and chemical toxicology","28503984",2017,"United States"
"Differentiation of cardiomyocytes and generation of human engineered heart tissue.","Since the advent of the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), numerous protocols have been developed to differentiate hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes and then subsequently assess their ability to recapitulate the properties of adult human cardiomyocytes. However, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are often assessed in single-cell assays. A shortcoming of these assays is the limited ability to characterize the physiological parameters of cardiomyocytes, such as contractile force, due to random orientations. This protocol describes the differentiation of cardiomyocytes from hiPSCs, which occurs within 14 d. After casting, cardiomyocytes undergo 3D assembly. This produces fibrin-based engineered heart tissues (EHTs)-in a strip format-that generate force under auxotonic stretch conditions. 10-15 d after casting, the EHTs can be used for contractility measurements. This protocol describes parallel expansion of hiPSCs; standardized generation of defined embryoid bodies, growth factor and small-molecule-based cardiac differentiation; and standardized generation of EHTs. To carry out the protocol, experience in advanced cell culture techniques is required.","Nature protocols","28492526",2017,"England"
"A novel method for quantitative measurements of gene expression in single living cells.","Gene expression is at the heart of virtually any biological process, and its deregulation is at the source of numerous pathological conditions. While impressive progress has been made in genome-wide measurements of mRNA and protein expression levels, it is still challenging to obtain highly quantitative measurements in single living cells. Here we describe a novel approach based on internal tagging of endogenous proteins with a reporter allowing luminescence and fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. Using luminescence microscopy, fluctuations of protein expression levels can be monitored in single living cells with high sensitivity and temporal resolution over extended time periods. The integrated protein decay reporter allows measuring protein degradation rates in the absence of protein synthesis inhibitors, and in combination with absolute protein levels allows determining absolute amounts of proteins synthesized over the cell cycle. Finally, the internal tag can be excised by inducible expression of Cre recombinase, which enables to estimate endogenous mRNA half-lives. Our method thus opens new avenues in quantitative analysis of gene expression in single living cells.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)","28456689",2017,"United States"
"Strategies for the acquisition of transcriptional and epigenetic information in single cells.","As the basic unit of living organisms, each single cell has unique molecular signatures and functions. Our ability to uncover the transcriptional and epigenetic signature of single cells has been hampered by the lack of tools to explore this area of research. The advent of microfluidic single cell technology along with single cell genome-wide DNA amplification methods had greatly improved our understanding of the expression variation in single cells. Transcriptional expression profile by multiplex qPCR or genome-wide RNA sequencing has enabled us to examine genes expression in single cells in different tissues. With the new tools, the identification of new cellular heterogeneity, novel marker genes, unique subpopulations, and spatial locations of each single cell can be acquired successfully. Epigenetic modifications for each single cell can also be obtained via similar methods. Based on single cell genome sequencing, single cell epigenetic information including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility have been explored and provided valuable insights regarding gene regulation and disease prognosis. In this article, we review the development of strategies to obtain single cell transcriptional and epigenetic data. Furthermore, we discuss ways in which single cell studies may help to provide greater understanding of the mechanisms of basic cardiovascular biology that will eventually lead to improvement in our ability to diagnose disease and develop new therapies.","Journal of thoracic disease","28446964",2017,"United States"

"Global survey of the immunomodulatory potential of common drugs.","Small-molecule drugs may complement antibody-based therapies in an immune-oncology setting, yet systematic methods for the identification and characterization of the immunomodulatory properties of these entities are lacking. We surveyed the immumomodulatory potential of 1,402 small chemical molecules, as defined by their ability to alter the cell-cell interactions among peripheral mononuclear leukocytes ex vivo, using automated microscopy and population-wide single-cell image analysis. Unexpectedly, ¡«10% of the agents tested affected these cell-cell interactions differentially. The results accurately recapitulated known immunomodulatory drug classes and revealed several clinically approved drugs that unexpectedly harbor the ability to modulate the immune system, which could potentially contribute to their physiological mechanism of action. For instance, the kinase inhibitor crizotinib promoted T cell interactions with monocytes, as well as with cancer cells, through inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase MSTR1 and subsequent upregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules. The approach offers an attractive platform for the personalized identification and characterization of immunomodulatory therapeutics.","Nature chemical biology","28437395",2017,"Austria"

"Mechanisms Underlying the Emergence of Post-acidosis Arrhythmia at the Tissue Level: A Theoretical Study.","Acidosis has complex electrophysiological effects, which are associated with a high recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Through multi-scale cardiac computer modeling, this study investigated the mechanisms underlying the emergence of post-acidosis arrhythmia at the tissue level. In simulations, ten Tusscher-Panfilov ventricular model was modified to incorporate various data on acidosis-induced alterations of cellular electrophysiology and intercellular electrical coupling. The single cell models were incorporated into multicellular one-dimensional (1D) fiber and 2D sheet tissue models. Electrophysiological effects were quantified as changes of action potential profile, sink-source interactions of fiber tissue, and the vulnerability of tissue to the genesis of unidirectional conduction that led to initiation of re-entry. It was shown that acidosis-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium load contributed to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in single cells. These DADs may be synchronized to overcome the source-sink mismatch arising from intercellular electrotonic coupling, and produce a premature ventricular complex (PVC) at the tissue level. The PVC conduction can be unidirectionally blocked in the transmural ventricular wall with altered electrical heterogeneity, resulting in the genesis of re-entry. In conclusion, altered source-sink interactions and electrical heterogeneity due to acidosis-induced cellular electrophysiological alterations may increase susceptibility to post-acidosis ventricular arrhythmias.","Frontiers in physiology","28424631",2017,"Switzerland"
"Unifying mechanism for different fibrotic diseases.","Fibrotic diseases are not well-understood. They represent a number of different diseases that are characterized by the development of severe organ fibrosis without any obvious cause, such as the devastating diseases idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma. These diseases have a poor prognosis comparable with endstage cancer and are uncurable. Given the phenotypic differences, it was assumed that the different fibrotic diseases also have different pathomechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that many endstage fibrotic diseases, including IPF; scleroderma; myelofibrosis; kidney-, pancreas-, and heart-fibrosis; and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis converge in the activation of the AP1 transcription factor c-JUN in the pathologic fibroblasts. Expression of the related AP1 transcription factor FRA2 was restricted to pulmonary artery hypertension. Induction of c-Jun in mice was sufficient to induce severe fibrosis in multiple organs and steatohepatosis, which was dependent on sustained c-Jun expression. Single cell mass cytometry revealed that c-Jun activates multiple signaling pathways in mice, including pAkt and CD47, which were also induced in human disease. ¦ÁCD47 antibody treatment and VEGF or PI3K inhibition reversed various organ c-Jun-mediated fibroses in vivo. These data suggest that c-JUN is a central molecular mediator of most fibrotic conditions.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","28424250",2017,"United States"
"A mathematical model for active contraction in healthy and failing myocytes and left ventricles.","Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, in particular myocardial dysfunction, which may lead to heart failure eventually. Understanding the electro-mechanics of the heart will help in developing more effective clinical treatments. In this paper, we present a multi-scale electro-mechanics model of the left ventricle (LV). The Holzapfel-Ogden constitutive law was used to describe the passive myocardial response in tissue level, a modified Grandi-Pasqualini-Bers model was adopted to model calcium dynamics in individual myocytes, and the active tension was described using the Niederer-Hunter-Smith myofilament model. We first studied the electro-mechanics coupling in a single myocyte in the healthy and diseased left ventricle, and then the single cell model was embedded in a dynamic LV model to investigate the compensation mechanism of LV pump function due to myocardial dysfunction caused by abnormality in cellular calcium dynamics. The multi-scale LV model was solved using an in-house developed hybrid immersed boundary method with finite element extension. The predictions of the healthy LV model agreed well with the clinical measurements and other studies, and likewise, the results in the failing states were also consistent with clinical observations. In particular, we found that a low level of intracellular Ca2+ transient in myocytes can result in LV pump function failure even with increased myocardial contractility, decreased systolic blood pressure, and increased diastolic filling pressure, even though they will increase LV stroke volume. Our work suggested that treatments targeted at increased contractility and lowering the systolic blood pressure alone are not sufficient in preventing LV pump dysfunction, restoring a balanced physiological Ca2+ handling mechanism is necessary.","PloS one","28406991",2017,"United Kingdom"
"Multi-Imaging Method to Assay the Contractile Mechanical Output of Micropatterned Human iPSC-Derived Cardiac Myocytes.","RATIONALE: During each beat, cardiac myocytes (CMs) generate the mechanical output necessary for heart function through contractile mechanisms that involve shortening of sarcomeres along myofibrils. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be differentiated into CMs (hiPSC-CMs) that model cardiac contractile mechanical output more robustly when micropatterned into physiological shapes. Quantifying the mechanical output of these cells enables us to assay cardiac activity in a dish.OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a computational platform that integrates analytic approaches to quantify the mechanical output of single micropatterned hiPSC-CMs from microscopy videos.METHODS AND RESULTS: We micropatterned single hiPSC-CMs on deformable polyacrylamide substrates containing fluorescent microbeads. We acquired videos of single beating cells, of microbead displacement during contractions, and of fluorescently labeled myofibrils. These videos were independently analyzed to obtain parameters that capture the mechanical output of the imaged single cells. We also developed novel methods to quantify sarcomere length from videos of moving myofibrils and to analyze loss of synchronicity of beating in cells with contractile defects. We tested this computational platform by detecting variations in mechanical output induced by drugs and in cells expressing low levels of myosin-binding protein C.CONCLUSIONS: Our method can measure the cardiac function of single micropatterned hiPSC-CMs and determine contractile parameters that can be used to elucidate mechanisms that underlie variations in CM function. This platform will be amenable to future studies of the effects of mutations and drugs on cardiac function.","Circulation research","28400398",2017,"United States"
"Super-resolution microscopy approaches to nuclear nanostructure imaging.","The human genome has been decoded, but we are still far from understanding the regulation of all gene activities. A largely unexplained role in these regulatory mechanisms is played by the spatial organization of the genome in the cell nucleus which has far-reaching functional consequences for gene regulation. Until recently, it appeared to be impossible to study this problem on the nanoscale by light microscopy. However, novel developments in optical imaging technology have radically surpassed the limited resolution of conventional far-field fluorescence microscopy (ca. 200nm). After a brief review of available super-resolution microscopy (SRM) methods, we focus on a specific SRM approach to study nuclear genome structure at the single cell/single molecule level, Spectral Precision Distance/Position Determination Microscopy (SPDM). SPDM, a variant of localization microscopy, makes use of conventional fluorescent proteins or single standard organic fluorophores in combination with standard (or only slightly modified) specimen preparation conditions; in its actual realization mode, the same laser frequency can be used for both photoswitching and fluorescence read out. Presently, the SPDM method allows us to image nuclear genome organization in individual cells down to few tens of nanometer (nm) of structural resolution, and to perform quantitative analyses of individual small chromatin domains; of the nanoscale distribution of histones, chromatin remodeling proteins, and transcription, splicing and repair related factors. As a biomedical research application, using dual-color SPDM, it became possible to monitor in mouse cardiomyocyte cells quantitatively the effects of ischemia conditions on the chromatin nanostructure (DNA). These novel &quot;molecular optics&quot; approaches open an avenue to study the nuclear landscape directly in individual cells down to the single molecule level and thus to test models of functional genome architecture at unprecedented resolution.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)","28390838",2017,"United States"

"Partial Reprogramming of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes into Neurons.","Direct reprogramming of somatic cells has been demonstrated, however, it is unknown whether electrophysiologically-active somatic cells derived from separate germ layers can be interconverted. We demonstrate that partial direct reprogramming of mesoderm-derived cardiomyocytes into neurons is feasible, generating cells exhibiting structural and electrophysiological properties of both cardiomyocytes and neurons. Human and mouse pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (PSC-CMs) were transduced with the neurogenic transcription factors Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l and NeuroD. We found that CMs adopted neuronal morphologies as early as day 3 post-transduction while still retaining a CM gene expression profile. At week 1 post-transduction, we found that reprogrammed CMs expressed neuronal markers such as Tuj1, Map2, and NCAM. At week 3 post-transduction, mature neuronal markers such as vGlut and synapsin were observed. With single-cell qPCR, we temporally examined CM gene expression and observed increased expression of neuronal markers Dcx, Map2, and Tubb3. Patch-clamp analysis confirmed the neuron-like electrophysiological profile of reprogrammed CMs. This study demonstrates that PSC-CMs are amenable to partial neuronal conversion, yielding a population of cells exhibiting features of both neurons and CMs.","Scientific reports","28327614",2017,"United States"

"Single-cell Microinjection for Cell Communication Analysis.","Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow the communication of neighboring cells. This communication depends on the contribution of a hemichannel by each neighboring cell to form the gap junction. In mammalian cells, the hemichannel is formed by six connexins, monomers with four transmembrane domains and a C and N terminal within the cytoplasm. Gap junctions permit the exchange of ions, second messengers, and small metabolites. In addition, they have important roles in many forms of cellular communication within physiological processes such as synaptic transmission, heart contraction, cell growth and differentiation. We detail how to perform a single-cell microinjection of Lucifer Yellow to visualize cellular communication via gap-junctions in living cells. It is expected that in functional gap junctions, the dye will diffuse from the loaded cell to the connected cells. It is a very useful technique to study gap junctions since you can evaluate the diffusion of the fluorescence in real time. We discuss how to prepare the cells and the micropipette, how to use a micromanipulator and inject a low molecular weight fluorescent dye in an epithelial cell line.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","28287521",2017,"United States"

"Cardiac KATP channel modulation by 16Hz magnetic fields - A theoretical study.","Heart exposure to 16Hz magnetic fields (MFs) was shown to be cardio-protective for diseased hearts; still, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We hypothesize that a possible one mechanism is an increased trans-membrane KATP channel open probability due to modulation of the degree of dissociation between K+ ions, having a resonance frequency of 16Hz, and the channel selectivity filter. The Fan-Makielski Markovian KATP channel model was adopted, and the MF bio-effect was manifested by modulating the open probability of the channel using the predictive MF bio-effect parameter based on Binhi's quantum mechanics model. The model was integrated in a ventricular single cell model and the MF effect on the calcium transients [Ca2+] was assessed. Periodic pacing (Cycle Length CL=1sec) was applied and a 16Hz or 32Hz MF was turned on at t=0 for 10min. MF exposure gradually decreased [Ca2+] due to KATP channel opening, more strongly at 16Hz. Additionally, a small negative diastolic shift was observed. These numerical results demonstrated similarity to published experimental data using similar 16Hz MF exposure. We conclude that 16Hz MF exposure increases the KATP channel open probability, lowering the cellular calcium load. Our model could be integrated in a tissue model to predict optimal MF parameters for future cardiac therapy devices.","Conference proceedings : ...

"Pro-arrhythmic effect of heart rate variability during periodic pacing.","Clinically, healthy hearts have been associated with a high ventricular heart rate variability (HRV) while diseased hearts have been known to exhibit low ventricular HRV. Hence, low HRV is suggested to be a marker of cardiac ventricular arrhythmias. Over the past few years, there has been considerable amount of interest in incorporating HRV in pacing to emulate healthy heart conditions and re-stabilize the electrical activity in diseased hearts. Recently, we used single cell numerical simulations to demonstrate that HRV incorporated into periodic pacing promotes alternans formation and thus, can be pro-arrhythmic. Here, we performed high-resolution optical mapping experiments on Langendorff perfused, healthy whole mice hearts to validate our numerical findings. Our results indeed demonstrate that HRV promoted the onset of cardiac alternans, which is believed to be a precursor of fatal cardiac rhythms. Hence, our present study suggests that incorporating HRV into periodic pacing while addressing several clinical needs may not be safe. There is a pressing need to better understand paced cardiac dynamics and develop anti-arrhythmic pacing techniques that would prevent cardiac arrhythmias.","Conference proceedings : ...

"Electrophysiological properties of computational human ventricular cell action potential models under acute ischemic conditions.","Acute myocardial ischemia is one of the main causes of sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms have been investigated primarily in experimental and computational studies using different animal species, but human studies remain scarce. In this study, we assess the ability of four human ventricular action potential models (ten Tusscher and Panfilov, 2006; Grandi et<U+00A0>al., 2010; Carro et<U+00A0>al., 2011; O'Hara et<U+00A0>al., 2011) to simulate key electrophysiological consequences of acute myocardial ischemia in single cell and tissue simulations. We specifically focus on evaluating the effect of extracellular potassium concentration and activation of the ATP-sensitive inward-rectifying potassium current on action potential duration, post-repolarization refractoriness, and conduction velocity, as the most critical factors in determining reentry vulnerability during ischemia. Our results show that the Grandi and O'Hara models required modifications to reproduce expected ischemic changes, specifically modifying the intracellular potassium concentration in the Grandi model and the sodium current in the O'Hara model. With these modifications, the four human ventricular cell AP models analyzed in this study reproduce the electrophysiological alterations in repolarization, refractoriness, and conduction velocity caused by acute myocardial ischemia. However, quantitative differences are observed between the models and overall, the ten Tusscher and modified O'Hara models show closest agreement to experimental data.","Progress in biophysics and molecular biology","28223156",2017,"United Kingdom"
"Luteolin Enhances Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase Activity through p38 MAPK Signaling thus Improving Rat Cardiac Function after Ischemia/Reperfusion.","AIMS: A major challenge for current therapeutic strategies against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is the lack of effective drugs. Considering luteolin enhances the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) to improve the systolic/diastolic function of rat hearts and cardiomyocytes during the I/R process, we studied the regulatory function of the p38 MAPK pathway in this protective mechanism.METHODS: Isolated cardiomyocytes and perfused hearts were separately divided into five groups and used to investigate I/R. The phosphorylation of p38 and phospholamban (p-PLB), the levels and activity of SERCA2a and the levels of proteins related to apoptosis were measured. Apoptotic cells were assessed using the TUNEL assay. Single-cell shortening, Ca2+ transients, and the decay of the mitochondrial membrane potential (¦¤¦×m) were detected.RESULTS: The p38 MAPK pathway was activated during the I/R process, and inhibiting it with SB203580 promoted p-PLB, which enhanced the activity of SERCA2a and relieved the calcium overload to promote the recovery of the ¦¤¦×m and reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis in I/R. Luteolin also suppressed the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and showed cardioprotective effects during I/R injury.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that luteolin enhances SERCA2a activity to improve systolic/diastolic function during I/R in rat hearts and cardiomyocytes by attenuating the inhibitive effects of the p38 pathway on p-PLB.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","28222421",2017,"Germany"

Using individual isolated cells, we measured knockin reporters, mRNAs, signaling (phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phospholamban), and contraction. We found that the ¦Â1 and ¦Á1B were present in all myocytes. The ¦Á1A was present in 60%, with high levels in 20%. The ¦Â2 and ¦Â3 were detected in only ¡Ö5% of myocytes, mostly in different cells. In intact heart, 30% of total ¦Â-ARs were ¦Â2 and 20% were ¦Â3, both mainly in nonmyocytes.CONCLUSION: The dominant ventricular myocyte ARs present in all cells are the ¦Â1 and ¦Á1B. The ¦Â2 and ¦Â3 are mostly absent in myocytes but are abundant in nonmyocytes. The ¦Á1A is in just over half of cells, but only 20% have high levels. Four distinct myocyte AR phenotypes are defined: 30% of cells with ¦Â1 and ¦Á1B only; 60% that also have the ¦Á1A; and 5% each that also have the ¦Â2 or ¦Â3. The results raise cautions in experimental design, such as receptor overexpression in myocytes that do not express the AR normally.

"The Endothelium Solves Problems That Endothelial Cells Do Not Know Exist.","The endothelium is the single layer of cells that lines the entire cardiovascular system and regulates vascular tone and blood-tissue exchange, recruits blood cells, modulates blood clotting, and determines the formation of new blood vessels. To control each function, the endothelium uses a remarkable sensory capability to continuously monitor vanishingly small changes in the concentrations of many simultaneously arriving extracellular activators that each provides cues to the physiological state. Here we suggest that the extraordinary sensory capabilities of the endothelium do not come from single cells but from the combined activity of a large number of endothelial cells. Each cell has a limited, but distinctive, sensory capacity and shares information with neighbours so that sensing is distributed among cells. Communication of information among connected cells provides system-level sensing substantially greater than the capabilities of any single cell and, as a collective, the endothelium solves sensory problems too complex for any single cell.","Trends in pharmacological sciences","28214012",2017,"United Kingdom"
"The laminar organization of the motor cortex in monodactylous mammals: a comparative assessment based on horse, chimpanzee, and macaque.","The architecture of the neocortex classically consists of six layers, based on cytological criteria and on the layout of intra/interlaminar connections. Yet, the comparison of cortical cytoarchitectonic features across different species proves overwhelmingly difficult, due to the lack of a reliable model to analyze the connection patterns of neuronal ensembles forming the different layers. We first defined a set of suitable morphometric cell features, obtained in digitized Nissl-stained sections of the motor cortex of the horse, chimpanzee, and crab-eating macaque. We then modeled them using a quite general non-parametric data representation model, showing that the assessment of neuronal cell complexity (i.e., how a given cell differs from its neighbors) can be performed using a suitable measure of statistical dispersion such as the mean absolute deviation-mean absolute deviation (MAD). Along with the non-parametric combination and permutation methodology, application of MAD allowed not only to estimate, but also to compare and rank the motor cortical complexity across different species. As to the instances presented in this paper, we show that the pyramidal layers of the motor cortex of the horse are far more irregular than those of primates. This feature could be related to the different organizations of the motor system in monodactylous mammals.","Brain structure &amp; function","28210850",2017,"Germany"

"Cell population structure prior to bifurcation predicts efficiency of directed differentiation in human induced pluripotent cells.","Steering the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) toward specific cell types is crucial for patient-specific disease modeling and drug testing. This effort requires the capacity to predict and control when and how multipotent progenitor cells commit to the desired cell fate. Cell fate commitment represents a critical state transition or &quot;tipping point&quot; at which complex systems undergo a sudden qualitative shift. To characterize such transitions during iPSC to cardiomyocyte differentiation, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 96 developmental genes at single-cell resolution. We identified a bifurcation event early in the trajectory when a primitive streak-like cell population segregated into the mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Before this branching point, we could detect the signature of an imminent critical transition: increase in cell heterogeneity and coordination of gene expression. Correlation analysis of gene expression profiles at the tipping point indicates transcription factors that drive the state transition toward each alternative cell fate and their relationships with specific phenotypic readouts. The latter helps us to facilitate small molecule screening for differentiation efficiency. To this end, we set up an analysis of cell population structure at the tipping point after systematic variation of the protocol to bias the differentiation toward mesodermal or endodermal cell lineage. We were able to predict the proportion of cardiomyocytes many days before cells manifest the differentiated phenotype. The analysis of cell populations undergoing a critical state transition thus affords a tool to forecast cell fate outcomes and can be used to optimize differentiation protocols to obtain desired cell populations.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","28167799",2017,"United States"
"Human Amniocytes Are Receptive to Chemically Induced Reprogramming to Pluripotency.","Restoring pluripotency using chemical compounds alone would be a major step forward in developing clinical-grade pluripotent stem cells, but this has not yet been reported in human cells. We previously demonstrated that VPA_AFS cells, human amniocytes cultivated with valproic acid (VPA) acquired functional pluripotency while remaining distinct from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), questioning the relationship between the modulation of cell fate and molecular regulation of the pluripotency network. Here, we used single-cell analysis and functional assays to reveal that VPA treatment resulted in a homogeneous population of self-renewing non-transformed cells that fulfill the hallmarks of pluripotency, i.e., a short G1 phase, a dependence on glycolytic metabolism, expression of epigenetic modifications on histones 3 and 4, and reactivation of endogenous OCT4 and downstream targets at a lower level than that observed in hESCs. Mechanistic insights into the process of VPA-induced reprogramming revealed that it was dependent on OCT4 promoter activation, which was achieved independently of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway or GSK3¦Â inhibition but was concomitant with the presence of acetylated histones H3K9 and H3K56, which promote pluripotency. Our data identify, for the first time, the pluripotent transcriptional and molecular signature and metabolic status of human chemically induced pluripotent stem cells.","Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy","28153093",2017,"United Kingdom"
"Neonatal Transplantation Confers Maturation of PSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Conducive to Modeling Cardiomyopathy.","Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) offer unprecedented opportunities for disease modeling and personalized<U+00A0>medicine.

We previously showed that there is a neonatal arrest of long-term cultured PSC-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs). Here, we demonstrate that PSC-CMs mature into adult CMs when transplanted into neonatal hearts. PSC-CMs became similar to adult CMs in morphology, structure, and function within a month of transplantation into rats. The similarity was further supported by single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Moreover, this in<U+00A0>vivo maturation allowed patient-derived PSC-CMs to reveal the disease phenotype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which manifests predominantly in adults. This study lays a foundation for understanding human CM maturation and pathogenesis and can be instrumental in PSC-based modeling of adult heart diseases.","Cell reports","28076798",2017,"United States"
"Purification of small molecule-induced cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells using a reporter system.","In order to realize the practical use of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes for the purpose of clinical use or cardiovascular research, the generation of large numbers of highly purified cardiomyocytes should be achieved. Here, we show an efficient method for cardiac differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in chemically defined conditions and purification of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes using a reporter system. Regulation of the Wnt/¦Â-catenin signaling pathway is implicated in the induction of the cardiac differentiation of hPSCs. We increased cardiac differentiation efficiency of hiPSCs in chemically defined conditions through combined treatment with XAV939, a tankyrase inhibitor and IWP2, a porcupine inhibitor and optimized concentrations. Although cardiac differentiation efficiency was high (&gt;80%), it was difficult to suppress differentiation into non-cardiac cells, Therefore, we applied a lentiviral reporter system, wherein green fluorescence protein (GFP) and Zeocin-resistant gene are driven by promoter activation of a gene (TNNT2) encoding cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a cardiac-specific protein, to exclude non-cardiomyocytes from differentiated cell populations. We transduced this reporter construct into differentiated cells using a lentiviral vector and then obtained highly purified hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by treatment with the lowest effective dose of Zeocin. We significantly increased transgenic efficiency through manipulation of the cells in which the differentiated cells were simultaneously infected with virus and re-plated after single-cell dissociation. Purified cells specifically expressed GFP, cTnT, displayed typical properties of cardiomyocytes. This study provides an efficient strategy for obtaining large quantities of highly purified hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for application in regenerative medicine and biomedical research.","Journal of cellular physiology","28063225",2017,"United States"

"An atlas of transcriptional, chromatin accessibility, and surface marker changes in human mesoderm development.","Mesoderm is the developmental precursor to myriad human tissues including bone, heart, and skeletal muscle. Unravelling the molecular events through which these lineages become diversified from one another is integral to developmental biology and understanding changes in cellular fate. To this end, we developed an in vitro system to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells through primitive streak intermediates into paraxial mesoderm and its derivatives (somites, sclerotome, dermomyotome) and separately, into lateral mesoderm and its derivatives (cardiac mesoderm). Whole-population and single-cell analyses of these purified populations of human mesoderm lineages through RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and high-throughput surface marker screens illustrated how transcriptional changes co-occur with changes in open chromatin and surface marker landscapes throughout human mesoderm development. This molecular atlas will facilitate study of human mesoderm development (which cannot be interrogated in vivo due to restrictions on human embryo studies) and provides a broad resource for the study of gene regulation in development at the single-cell level, knowledge that might one day be exploited for regenerative medicine.","Scientific data","27996962",2016,"United States"
"Atrial Heterogeneity Generates Re-entrant Substrate during Atrial Fibrillation and Anti-arrhythmic Drug Action: Mechanistic Insights from Canine Atrial Models.","Anti-arrhythmic drug therapy is a frontline treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), but its success rates are highly variable. This is due to incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of action of specific drugs on the atrial substrate at different stages of AF progression. We aimed to elucidate the role of cellular, tissue and organ level atrial heterogeneities in the generation of a re-entrant substrate during AF progression, and their modulation by the acute action of selected anti-arrhythmic drugs. To explore the complex cell-to-organ mechanisms, a detailed biophysical models of the entire 3D canine atria was developed. The model incorporated atrial geometry and fibre orientation from high-resolution micro-computed tomography, region-specific atrial cell electrophysiology and the effects of progressive AF-induced remodelling. The actions of multi-channel class III anti-arrhythmic agents vernakalant and amiodarone were introduced in the model by inhibiting appropriate ionic channel currents according to experimentally reported concentration-response relationships. AF was initiated by applied ectopic pacing in the pulmonary veins, which led to the generation of localized sustained re-entrant waves (rotors), followed by progressive wave breakdown and rotor multiplication in both atria. The simulated AF scenarios were in agreement with observations in canine models and patients. The 3D atrial simulations revealed that a re-entrant substrate was typically provided by tissue regions of high heterogeneity of action potential duration (APD). Amiodarone increased atrial APD and reduced APD heterogeneity and was more effective in terminating AF than vernakalant, which increased both APD and APD dispersion. In summary, the initiation and sustenance of rotors in AF is linked to atrial APD heterogeneity and APD reduction due to progressive remodelling. Our results suggest that anti-arrhythmic strategies that increase atrial APD without increasing its dispersion are effective in terminating AF.","PLoS computational biology","27984585",2016,"United Kingdom"
"Genetics of inherited cardiocutaneous syndromes: a review.","The life of a human being originates as a single cell which, under the influence of certain factors, divides sequentially into multiple cells that subsequently become committed to develop and differentiate into the different structures and organs. Alterations occurring early on in the development process may lead to fetal demise in utero. Conversely, abnormalities at later stages may result in structural and/or functional abnormalities of varying severities. The cardiovascular system and skin share certain developmental and structural factors; therefore, it is not surprising to find several inherited syndromes with both cardiac and skin manifestations. Here, we will review the overlapping pathways in the development of the skin and heart, as well as the resulting syndromes. We will also highlight several cutaneous clues that may help physicians screen and uncover cardiac anomalies that may be otherwise hidden and result in sudden cardiac death.","Open heart","27933191",2016,"England"
"PHLPPing through history: a decade in the life of PHLPP phosphatases.","In the decade since their discovery, the PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases (PHLPP) have emerged as critical regulators of cellular homeostasis, and their dysregulation is associated with various pathophysiologies, ranging from cancer to degenerative diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. The two PHLPP isozymes, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, were identified in a search for phosphatases that dephosphorylate Akt, and thus suppress growth factor signaling. However, given that there are over 200<U+2009>000 phosphorylated residues in a single cell, and fewer than 50 Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, it is not surprising that PHLPP has many other cellular functions yet to be discovered, including a recently identified role in regulating the epigenome. Both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 are commonly deleted in human cancers, supporting a tumor suppressive role. Conversely, the levels of one isozyme, PHLPP1, are elevated in diabetes. Thus, mechanisms to correctly control PHLPP activity in cells are critical for normal cellular homeostasis. This review summarizes the known functions of PHLPP and its role in disease.","Biochemical Society transactions","27913677",2016,"United States"

"Systematic Analysis of Cell-to-Cell Expression Variation of T Lymphocytes in a Human Cohort Identifies Aging and Genetic Associations.","Cell-to-cell expression variation (CEV) is a prevalent feature of even well-defined cell populations, but its functions, particularly at the organismal level, are not well understood.

Analyses of 840 CEV phenotypes spanning multiple baseline measurements of 14 proteins in 28 T<U+00A0>cell subpopulations suggest that the quantitative extent of CEV can exhibit substantial subject-to-subject differences and yet remain stable within healthy individuals over months. We linked CEV to age and disease-associated genetic polymorphisms, thus implicating CEV as a biomarker of aging and disease susceptibility and suggesting that it might play an important role in health and disease.

"Modulation of the contractility of micropatterned myocardial cells with nanoscale forces using atomic force microscopy.","The ability to modulate cardiomyocyte contractility is important for bioengineering applications ranging from heart disease treatments to biorobotics. In this study, we examined the changes in contraction frequency of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes upon single-cell-level nanoscale mechanical stimulation using atomic force microscopy. To measure the response of same density of cells, they were micropatterned into micropatches of fixed geometry. To examine the effect of the substrate stiffness on the behavior of cells, they were cultured on a stiffer and a softer surface, glass and poly (dimethylsiloxane), respectively. Upon periodic cyclic stimulation of 300 nN at 5 Hz, a significant reduction in the rate of synchronous contraction of the cell patches on poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates was observed with respect to their spontaneous beat rate, while the cell patches on glass substrates maintained or increased their contraction rate after the stimulation. On the other hand, single cells mostly maintained their contraction rate and could only withstand a lower magnitude of forces compared to micropatterned cell patches. This study reveals that the contraction behavior of cardiomyocytes can be modulated mechanically through cyclic nanomechanical stimulation, and the degree and mode of this modulation depend on the cell connectivity and substrate mechanical properties.","Nanobiomedicine","29942390",2016,"England"
"Transcriptomic Profiling Maps Anatomically Patterned Subpopulations among Single Embryonic Cardiac Cells.","Embryonic gene expression intricately reflects anatomical context, developmental stage, and cell type.

We segregated these cells by type using unsupervised bioinformatics analysis and identified chamber-specific genes.

"From cytoskeletal dynamics to organ asymmetry: a nonlinear, regulative pathway underlies left-right patterning.","Consistent left-right (LR) asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of the bodyplan across phyla, and errors of laterality form an important class of human birth defects. Its molecular underpinning was first discovered as a sequential pathway of left- and right-sided gene expression that controlled positioning of the heart and visceral organs. Recent data have revised this picture in two important ways. First, the physical origin of chirality has been identified; cytoskeletal dynamics underlie the asymmetry of single-cell behaviour and patterning of the LR axis. Second, the pathway is not linear: early disruptions that alter the normal sidedness of upstream asymmetric genes do not necessarily induce defects in the laterality of the downstream genes or in organ situs Thus, the LR pathway is a unique example of two fascinating aspects of biology: the interplay of physics and genetics in establishing large-scale anatomy, and regulative (shape-homeostatic) pathways that correct molecular and anatomical errors over time. Here, we review aspects of asymmetry from its intracellular, cytoplasmic origins to the recently uncovered ability of the LR control circuitry to achieve correct gene expression and morphology despite reversals of key 'determinant' genes. We provide novel functional data, in Xenopus laevis, on conserved elements of the cytoskeleton that drive asymmetry, and comparatively analyse it together with previously published results in the field. Our new observations and meta-analysis demonstrate that despite aberrant expression of upstream regulatory genes, embryos can progressively normalize transcriptional cascades and anatomical outcomes. LR patterning can thus serve as a paradigm of how subcellular physics and gene expression cooperate to achieve developmental robustness of a body axis.This article is part of the themed issue 'Provocative questions in left-right asymmetry'.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Moreover, we do not know how pervasive mammalian mitophagy is in vivo and fundamental questions remain unanswered. For example, is mitophagy common to all tissues under basal conditions or does it only occur in highly oxidative tissues under stress? This paucity of knowledge is largely due to a lack of experimentally tractable tools that can measure and monitor mitophagy in tissues.

"Stem cell-derived models to improve mechanistic understanding and prediction of human drug-induced liver injury.","Current preclinical drug testing does not predict some forms of adverse drug reactions in humans. Efforts at improving predictability of drug-induced tissue injury in humans include using stem cell technology to generate human cells for screening for adverse effects of drugs in humans. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells means that it may ultimately be possible to develop personalized toxicology to determine interindividual susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. However, the complexity of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury means that no current single-cell model, whether of primary liver tissue origin, from liver cell lines, or derived from stem cells, adequately emulates what is believed to occur during human drug-induced liver injury. Nevertheless, a single-cell model of a human hepatocyte which emulates key features of a hepatocyte is likely to be valuable in assessing potential chemical risk; furthermore, understanding how to generate a relevant hepatocyte will also be critical to efforts to build complex multicellular models of the liver. Currently, hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from stem cells still fall short of recapitulating the full mature hepatocellular phenotype. Therefore, we convened a number of experts from the areas of preclinical and clinical hepatotoxicity and safety assessment, from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies, to specifically explore the application of stem cells in hepatotoxicity safety assessment and to make recommendations for the way forward. In this short review, we particularly discuss the importance of benchmarking stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells to their terminally differentiated human counterparts using defined phenotyping, to make sure the cells are relevant and comparable between labs, and outline why this process is essential before the cells are introduced into chemical safety assessment.

Here we used micro-electrode arrays and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to investigate the impact of EHMT1 deficiency at the network and single cell level. We show that EHMT1 deficiency impaired neural network activity during the transition from uncorrelated background action potential firing to synchronized network bursting. Spontaneous bursting and excitatory synaptic currents were transiently reduced, whereas miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents were not affected. Finally, we show that loss of function of EHMT1 ultimately resulted in less regular network bursting patterns later in development. These data suggest that the developmental impairments observed in EHMT1-deficient networks may result in a temporal misalignment between activity-dependent developmental processes thereby contributing to the pathophysiology of Kleefstra syndrome.","Scientific reports","27767173",2016,"England"

"Pilot Study of Propofol-induced Slow Waves as a Pharmacologic Test for Brain Dysfunction after Brain Injury.","Slow waves (less than 1 Hz) are the most important electroencephalogram signatures of nonrapid eye movement sleep.

While considered to have a substantial importance in, for example, providing conditions for single-cell rest and preventing long-term neural damage, a disturbance in this neurophysiologic phenomenon is a potential indicator of brain dysfunction.Since, in healthy individuals, slow waves can be induced with anesthetics, the authors tested the possible association between hypoxic brain injury and slow-wave activity in comatose postcardiac arrest patients (n = 10) using controlled propofol exposure. The slow-wave activity was determined by calculating the low-frequency (less than 1 Hz) power of the electroencephalograms recorded approximately 48<U+2009>h after cardiac arrest.

"Stiff matrix induces switch to pure ¦Â-cardiac myosin heavy chain expression in human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes.","Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes hold great potential for in vitro modeling of diseases like cardiomyopathies. Yet, knowledge about expression and functional impact of sarcomeric protein isoforms like the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in hPSC-cardiomyocytes is scarce. We hypothesized that ventricular ¦Â-MyHC expression alters contraction and calcium kinetics and drives morphological and electrophysiological differentiation towards ventricular-like cardiomyocytes. To address this, we (1) generated human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) that switched towards exclusive ¦Â-MyHC, and (2) functionally and morphologically characterized these hESC-CMs at the single-cell level. MyHC-isoforms and functional properties were investigated during prolonged in vitro culture of cardiomyocytes in floating cardiac bodies (soft conditions) vs. culture on a stiff matrix. Using a specific anti-¦Â-MyHC and a newly generated anti-¦Á-MyHC-antibody, we found individual cardiomyocytes grown in cardiac bodies to mostly express both ¦Á- and ¦Â-MyHC-protein isoforms. Yet, 35 and 75<U+00A0>days of cultivation on laminin-coated glass switched 66 and 87<U+00A0>% of all cardiomyocytes to exclusively express ¦Â-MyHC, respectively. Twitch contraction and calcium transients were faster for CMs on laminin-glass. Surprisingly, both parameters were only little affected by the MyHC-isoform, although hESC-CMs with only ¦Â-MyHC had much lower ATP-turnover and tension cost, just as in human ventricular cardiomyocytes. Spontaneous contractions and no strict coupling of ¦Â-MyHC to ventricular-like action potentials suggest that MyHC-isoform expression does not fully determine the hESC-CM differentiation status. Stiff substrate-induced pure ¦Â-MyHC-protein expression in hESC-CMs, with several contractile parameters close to ventricular cardiomyocytes, provides a well-defined in vitro system for modeling of cardiomyopathies and drug screening approaches.","Basic research in cardiology","27743117",2016,"Germany"
"Single cell biology beyond the era of antibodies: relevance, challenges, and promises in biomedical research.","Research of the past two decades has proved the relevance of single cell biology in basic research and translational medicine. Successful detection and isolation of specific subsets is the key to understand their functional heterogeneity. Antibodies are conventionally used for this purpose, but their relevance in certain contexts is limited. In this review, we discuss some of these contexts, posing bottle neck for different fields of biology including biomedical research. With the advancement of chemistry, several methods have been introduced to overcome these problems. Even though microfluidics and microraft array are newer techniques exploited for single cell biology, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) remains the gold standard technique for isolation of cells for many biomedical applications, like stem cell therapy. Here, we present a comprehensive and comparative account of some of the probes that are useful in FACS. Further, we illustrate how these techniques could be applied in biomedical research. It is postulated that intracellular molecular markers like nucleostemin (GNL3), alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) and HIRA can be used for improving the outcome of cardiac as well as bone regeneration. Another field that could utilize intracellular markers is diagnostics, and we propose the use of specific peptide nucleic acid probes (PNPs) against certain miRNAs for cancer surgical margin prediction. The newer techniques for single cell biology, based on intracellular molecules, will immensely enhance the repertoire of possible markers for the isolation of cell types useful in biomedical research.","Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","27714408",2016,"Switzerland"
"Fluidic Logic Used in a Systems Approach to Enable Integrated Single-Cell Functional Analysis.","The study of single cells has evolved over the past several years to include expression and genomic analysis of an increasing number of single cells. Several studies have demonstrated wide spread variation and heterogeneity within cell populations of similar phenotype. While the characterization of these populations will likely set the foundation for our understanding of genomic- and expression-based diversity, it will not be able to link the functional differences of a single cell to its underlying genomic structure and activity. Currently, it is difficult to perturb single cells in a controlled environment, monitor and measure the response due to perturbation, and link these response measurements to downstream genomic and transcriptomic analysis. In order to address this challenge, we developed a platform to integrate and miniaturize many of the experimental steps required to study single-cell function. The heart of this platform is an elastomer-based integrated fluidic circuit that uses fluidic logic to select and sequester specific single cells based on a phenotypic trait for downstream experimentation. Experiments with sequestered cells that have been performed include on-chip culture, exposure to various stimulants, and post-exposure image-based response analysis, followed by preparation of the mRNA transcriptome for massively parallel sequencing analysis. The flexible system embodies experimental design and execution that enable routine functional studies of single cells.","Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology","27709111",2016,"Switzerland"

"Analysis of Calcium Transients and Uniaxial Contraction Force in Single Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes on Microstructured Elastic Substrate with Spatially Controlled Surface Chemistries.","The mechanical activity of cardiomyocytes is the result of a process called excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). A membrane depolarization wave induces a transient cytosolic calcium concentration increase that triggers activation of calcium-sensitive contractile proteins, leading to cell contraction and force generation. An experimental setup capable of acquiring simultaneously all ECC features would have an enormous impact on cardiac drug development and disease study. In this work, we develop a microengineered elastomeric substrate with tailor-made surface chemistry to measure simultaneously the uniaxial contraction force and the calcium transients generated by single human cardiomyocytes in vitro. Microreplication followed by photocuring is used to generate an array consisting of elastomeric micropillars. A second photochemical process is employed to spatially control the surface chemistry of the elastomeric pillar. As result, human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) can be confined in rectangular cell-adhesive areas, which induce cell elongation and promote suspended cell anchoring between two adjacent micropillars. In this end-to-end conformation, confocal fluorescence microscopy allows simultaneous detection of calcium transients and micropillar deflection induced by a single-cell uniaxial contraction force. Computational finite elements modeling (FEM) and 3D reconstruction of the cell-pillar interface allow force quantification. The platform is used to follow calcium dynamics and contraction force evolution in hESC-CMs cultures over the course of several weeks. Our results show how a biomaterial-based platform can be a versatile tool for in vitro assaying of cardiac functional properties of single-cell human cardiomyocytes, with applications in both in vitro developmental studies and drug screening on cardiac cultures.","Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","27643958",2016,"United States"
"iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes reveal abnormal TGF-¦Â signalling in left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.","Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is the third most prevalent cardiomyopathy in children and its pathogenesis has been associated with the developmental defect of the embryonic myocardium. We show that patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from LVNC patients carrying a mutation in the cardiac transcription factor TBX20 recapitulate a key aspect of the pathological phenotype at the single-cell level and this was associated with perturbed transforming growth factor beta (TGF-¦Â) signalling. LVNC iPSC-CMs have decreased proliferative capacity due to abnormal activation of TGF-¦Â signalling. TBX20 regulates the expression of TGF-¦Â signalling modifiers including one known to be a genetic cause of LVNC, PRDM16, and genome editing of PRDM16 caused proliferation defects in iPSC-CMs. Inhibition of TGF-¦Â signalling and genome correction of the TBX20 mutation were sufficient to reverse the disease phenotype. Our study demonstrates that iPSC-CMs are a useful tool for the exploration of pathological mechanisms underlying poorly understood cardiomyopathies including LVNC.","Nature cell biology","27642787",2016,"United States"

"Neuropeptide Y-mediated sex- and afferent-specific neurotransmissions contribute to sexual dimorphism of baroreflex afferent function.","BACKGROUND: Molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-mediated gender-difference in blood pressure (BP) regulation are largely unknown.METHODS: Baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) was evaluated by measuring the response of BP to phenylephrine/nitroprusside. Serum NPY concentration was determined using ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression of NPY receptors were assessed in tissue and single-cell by RT-PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry. NPY was injected into the nodose while arterial pressure was monitored. Electrophysiological recordings were performed on nodose neurons from rats by patch-clamp technique.RESULTS: The BRS was higher in female than male and ovariectomized rats, while serum NPY concentration was similar among groups. The sex-difference was detected in Y1R, not Y2R protein expression, however, both were upregulated upon ovariectomy and canceled by estrogen replacement. Immunostaining confirmed Y1R and Y2R expression in myelinated and unmyelinated afferents. Single-cell PCR demonstrated that Y1R expression/distribution was identical between A- and C-types, whereas, expressed level of Y2R was ~15 and ~7 folds higher in Ah- and C-types than A-types despite similar distribution. Activation of Y1R in nodose elevated BP, while activation of Y2R did the opposite. Activation of Y1R did not alter action potential duration (APD) of A-types, but activation of Y2R- and Y1R/Y2R in Ah- and C-types frequency-dependently prolonged APD. N-type ICa was reduced in A-, Ah- and C-types when either Y1R, Y2R, or both were activated. The sex-difference in Y1R expression was also observed in NTS.CONCLUSIONS: Sex- and afferent-specific expression of Neuropeptide-Y receptors in baroreflex afferent pathway may contribute to sexual-dimorphic neurocontrol of BP regulation.","Oncotarget","27623075",2016,"United States"
"Single-cell transcriptome and epigenomic reprogramming of cardiomyocyte-derived cardiac progenitor cells.","The molecular basis underlying the dedifferentiation of mammalian adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) into myocyte-derived cardiac progenitor cells (mCPCs) during cardiac tissue regeneration is poorly understood. We present data integrating single-cell transcriptome and whole-genome DNA methylome analyses of mouse mCPCs to understand the epigenomic reprogramming governing their intrinsic cellular plasticity. Compared to parental cardiomyocytes, mCPCs display epigenomic reprogramming with many differentially-methylated regions, both hypermethylated and hypomethylated, across the entire genome. Correlating well with the methylome, our single-cell transcriptomic data show that the genes encoding cardiac structure and function proteins are remarkably down-regulated in mCPCs, while those for cell cycle, proliferation, and stemness are significantly up-regulated. In addition, implanting mCPCs into infarcted mouse myocardium improves cardiac function with augmented left ventricular ejection fraction. This dataset suggests that the cellular plasticity of mammalian cardiomyocytes is the result of a well-orchestrated epigenomic reprogramming and a subsequent global transcriptomic alteration. Understanding cardiomyocyte epigenomic reprogramming may enable the design of future clinical therapies that induce cardiac regeneration, and prevent heart failure.","Scientific data","27622691",2016,"United States"

"A Simplified, Langendorff-Free Method for Concomitant Isolation of Viable Cardiac Myocytes and Nonmyocytes From the Adult Mouse Heart.","RATIONALE: Cardiovascular disease represents a global pandemic. The advent of and recent advances in mouse genomics, epigenomics, and transgenics offer ever-greater potential for powerful avenues of research. However, progress is often constrained by unique complexities associated with the isolation of viable myocytes from the adult mouse heart. Current protocols rely on retrograde aortic perfusion using specialized Langendorff apparatus, which poses considerable logistical and technical barriers to researchers and demands extensive training investment.OBJECTIVE: To identify and optimize a convenient, alternative approach, allowing the robust isolation and culture of adult mouse cardiac myocytes using only common surgical and laboratory equipment.METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac myocytes were isolated with yields comparable to those in published Langendorff-based methods, using direct needle perfusion of the LV ex vivo and without requirement for heparin injection. Isolated myocytes can be cultured antibiotic free, with retained organized contractile and mitochondrial morphology, transcriptional signatures, calcium handling, responses to hypoxia, neurohormonal stimulation, and electric pacing, and are amenable to patch clamp and adenoviral gene transfer techniques. Furthermore, the methodology permits concurrent isolation, separation, and coculture of myocyte and nonmyocyte cardiac populations.CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel, simplified method, demonstrating concomitant isolation of viable cardiac myocytes and nonmyocytes from the same adult mouse heart. We anticipate that this new approach will expand and accelerate innovative research in the field of cardiac biology.","Circulation research","27502479",2016,"United Kingdom"
"Large-Scale Production of Cardiomyocytes from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Using a Highly Reproducible Small Molecule-Based Differentiation Protocol.","Maximizing the benefit of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for research, disease modeling, pharmaceutical and clinical applications requires robust methods for the large-scale production of functional cell types, including cardiomyocytes.

Employing this strategy resulted in ~ 100% beating spheroids, consistently containing &gt; 80% cardiac troponin T-positive cells after 15 days of culture, validated in multiple hPSC lines. We also report on a variation of this protocol for use with cell lines not currently adapted to single-cell passaging, the success of which has been verified in 42 hPSC lines. Cardiomyocytes generated using these protocols express lineage-specific markers and show expected electrophysiological functionalities.

"Cardiomyocyte Circadian Oscillations Are Cell-Autonomous, Amplified by ¦Â-Adrenergic Signaling, and Synchronized in Cardiac Ventricle Tissue.","Circadian clocks impact vital cardiac parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate, and adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizes cellular circadian clocks in the heart and many other tissues throughout the body. Cardiac ventricle explants maintain autonomous contractions and robust circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in culture. In the present study, we examined the relationship between intrinsic myocardial function and circadian rhythms in cultures from mouse heart. We cultured ventricular explants or dispersed cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice expressing a PER2::LUC bioluminescent reporter of circadian clock gene expression. We found that isoproterenol, a ¦Â-adrenoceptor agonist known to increase heart rate and contractility, also amplifies PER2 circadian rhythms in ventricular explants. We found robust, cell-autonomous PER2 circadian rhythms in dispersed cardiomyocytes. Single-cell rhythms were initially synchronized in ventricular explants but desynchronized in dispersed cells. In addition, we developed a method for long-term, simultaneous monitoring of clock gene expression, contraction rate, and basal intracellular Ca2+ level in cardiomyocytes using PER2::LUC in combination with GCaMP3, a genetically encoded fluorescent Ca2+ reporter. In contrast to robust PER2 circadian rhythms in cardiomyocytes, we detected no rhythms in contraction rate and only weak rhythms in basal Ca2+ level. In summary, we found that PER2 circadian rhythms of cardiomyocytes are cell-autonomous, amplified by adrenergic signaling, and synchronized by intercellular communication in ventricle explants, but we detected no robust circadian rhythms in contraction rate or basal Ca2+.

To address this, we have developed &quot;mito-QC,&quot; a transgenic mouse with a pH-sensitive fluorescent mitochondrial signal. This allows the assessment of mitophagy and mitochondrial architecture in vivo. Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that mito-QC is compatible with classical and contemporary techniques in histochemistry and allows unambiguous in vivo detection of mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology at single-cell resolution within multiple organ systems.

"Modeling Electrophysiological Coupling and Fusion between Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Cardiomyocytes.","Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) delivery has demonstrated promise in preclinical and clinical trials for myocardial infarction therapy; however, broad acceptance is hindered by limited understanding of hMSC-human cardiomyocyte (hCM) interactions. To better understand the electrophysiological consequences of direct heterocellular connections between hMSCs and hCMs, three original mathematical models were developed, representing an experimentally verified triad of hMSC families with distinct functional ion channel currents. The arrhythmogenic risk of such direct electrical interactions in the setting of healthy adult myocardium was predicted by coupling and fusing these hMSC models to the published ten Tusscher midcardial hCM model. Substantial variations in action potential waveform-such as decreased action potential duration (APD) and plateau height-were found when hCMs were coupled to the two hMSC models expressing functional delayed rectifier-like human ether ¨¤-go-go K+ channel 1 (hEAG1); the effects were exacerbated for fused hMSC-hCM hybrid cells. The third family of hMSCs (Type C), absent of hEAG1 activity, led to smaller single-cell action potential alterations during coupling and fusion, translating to longer tissue-level mean action potential wavelength. In a simulated 2-D monolayer of cardiac tissue, re-entry vulnerability with low (5%) hMSC insertion was approximately eight-fold lower with Type C hMSCs compared to hEAG1-functional hMSCs. A 20% decrease in APD dispersion by Type C hMSCs compared to hEAG1-active hMSCs supports the claim of reduced arrhythmogenic potential of this cell type with low hMSC insertion. However, at moderate (15%) and high (25%) hMSC insertion, the vulnerable window increased independent of hMSC type. In summary, this study provides novel electrophysiological models of hMSCs, predicts possible arrhythmogenic effects of hMSCs when directly coupled to healthy hCMs, and proposes that isolating a subset of hMSCs absent of hEAG1 activity may offer increased safety as a cell delivery cardiotherapy at low levels of hMSC-hCM coupling.","PLoS computational biology","27454812",2016,"United States"
"Same-Single-Cell Analysis of Pacemaker-Specific Markers in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocyte Subtypes Classified by Electrophysiology.","Insights into the expression of pacemaker-specific markers in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte subtypes can facilitate the enrichment and track differentiation and maturation of hiPSC-derived pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes. To date, no study has directly assessed gene expression in each pacemaker-, atria-, and ventricular-like cardiomyocyte subtype derived from hiPSCs since currently the subtypes of these immature cardiomyocytes can only be identified by action potential profiles. Traditional acquisition of action potentials using patch-clamp recordings renders the cells unviable for subsequent analysis. We circumvented these issues by acquiring the action potential profile of a single cell optically followed by assessment of protein expression through immunostaining in that same cell. Our same-single-cell analysis for the first time revealed expression of proposed pacemaker-specific markers-hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN)4 channel and Islet (Isl)1-at the protein level in all three hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte subtypes. HCN4 expression was found to be higher in pacemaker-like hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes than atrial- and ventricular-like subtypes but its downregulation over time in all subtypes diminished the differences. Isl1 expression in pacemaker-like hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes was initially not statistically different than the contractile subtypes but did become statistically higher than ventricular-like cells with time. Our observations suggest that although HCN4 and Isl1 are differentially expressed in hiPSC-derived pacemaker-like relative to ventricular-like cardiomyocytes, these markers alone are insufficient in identifying hiPSC-derived pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes.

"Mapping the Pairwise Choices Leading from Pluripotency to Human Bone, Heart, and Other Mesoderm Cell Types.","Stem-cell differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types. Hence, comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel stem-cell differentiation toward desired fates. To this end, here, we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages, including bone, muscle, and heart. We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision, enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80%-99% pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints. This strategy enabled the generation of human bone and heart progenitors that could engraft in respective in<U+00A0>vivo models. Mapping stepwise chromatin and single-cell gene expression changes in mesoderm development uncovered somite segmentation, a previously unobservable human embryonic event transiently marked by HOPX expression.

"Effects of cellular origin on differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells.","Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be derived from various types of somatic cells by transient overexpression of 4 Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, C-MYC, and KLF4). Patient-specific iPSC derivatives (e.g., neuronal, cardiac, hepatic, muscular, and endothelial cells [ECs]) hold great promise in drug discovery and regenerative medicine. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the cellular origin can affect the differentiation, in vivo behavior, and single-cell gene expression signatures of human iPSC-derived ECs. We derived human iPSCs from 3 types of somatic cells of the same individuals: fibroblasts (FB-iPSCs), ECs (EC-iPSCs), and cardiac progenitor cells (CPC-iPSCs). We then differentiated them into ECs by sequential administration of Activin, BMP4, bFGF, and VEGF. EC-iPSCs at early passage (10 &lt; P &lt; 20) showed higher EC differentiation propensity and gene expression of EC-specific markers (PECAM1 and NOS3) than FB-iPSCs and CPC-iPSCs. In vivo transplanted EC-iPSC-ECs were recovered with a higher percentage of CD31<sup>+</sup> population and expressed higher EC-specific gene expression markers (PECAM1, KDR, and ICAM) as revealed by microfluidic single-cell quantitative PCR (qPCR). In vitro EC-iPSC-ECs maintained a higher CD31<sup>+</sup> population than FB-iPSC-ECs and CPC-iPSC-ECs with long-term culturing and passaging. These results indicate that cellular origin may influence lineage differentiation propensity of human iPSCs; hence, the somatic memory carried by early passage iPSCs should be carefully considered before clinical translation.","JCI insight","27398408",2016,"United States"
"Impaired Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Uptake and Release Promote Electromechanically and Spatially Discordant Alternans: A Computational Study.","Cardiac electrical dynamics are governed by cellular-level properties, such as action potential duration (APD) restitution and intracellular calcium (Ca) handling, and tissue-level properties, including conduction velocity restitution and cell-cell coupling. Irregular dynamics at the cellular level can lead to instabilities in cardiac tissue, including alternans, a beat-to-beat alternation in the action potential and/or the intracellular Ca transient. In this study, we incorporate a detailed single cell coupled map model of Ca cycling and bidirectional APD-Ca coupling into a spatially extended tissue model to investigate the influence of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca uptake and release properties on alternans and conduction block. We find that an intermediate SR Ca uptake rate and larger SR Ca release resulted in the widest range of stimulus periods that promoted alternans. However, both reduced SR Ca uptake and release promote arrhythmogenic spatially and electromechanically discordant alternans, suggesting a complex interaction between SR Ca handling and alternans characteristics at the cellular and tissue level.

"Resolving early mesoderm diversification through single-cell expression profiling.","In mammals, specification of the three major germ layers occurs during gastrulation, when cells ingressing through the primitive streak differentiate into the precursor cells of major organ systems. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear, as numbers of gastrulating cells are very limited. In the mouse embryo at embryonic day 6.5, cells located at the junction between the extra-embryonic region and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingress through the primitive streak. Subsequently, cells migrate, either surrounding the prospective ectoderm contributing to the embryo proper, or into the extra-embryonic region to form the yolk sac, umbilical cord and placenta. Fate mapping has shown that mature tissues such as blood and heart originate from specific regions of the pre-gastrula epiblast, but the plasticity of cells within the embryo and the function of key cell-type-specific transcription factors remain unclear. Here we analyse 1,205 cells from the epiblast and nascent Flk1(+) mesoderm of gastrulating mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing, representing the first transcriptome-wide in vivo view of early mesoderm formation during mammalian gastrulation. Additionally, using knockout mice, we study the function of Tal1, a key haematopoietic transcription factor, and demonstrate, contrary to previous studies performed using retrospective assays, that Tal1 knockout does not immediately bias precursor cells towards a cardiac fate.","Nature","27383781",2016,"United Kingdom"
"Coordinating cardiomyocyte interactions to direct ventricular chamber morphogenesis.","Many organs are composed of complex tissue walls that are structurally organized to optimize organ function. In particular, the ventricular myocardial wall of the heart comprises an outer compact layer that concentrically encircles the ridge-like inner trabecular layer. Although disruption in the morphogenesis of this myocardial wall can lead to various forms of congenital heart disease and non-compaction cardiomyopathies, it remains unclear how embryonic cardiomyocytes assemble to form ventricular wall layers of appropriate spatial dimensions and myocardial mass. Here we use advanced genetic and imaging tools in zebrafish to reveal an interplay between myocardial Notch and Erbb2 signalling that directs the spatial allocation of myocardial cells to their proper morphological positions in the ventricular wall. Although previous studies have shown that endocardial Notch signalling non-cell-autonomously promotes myocardial trabeculation through Erbb2 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, we discover that distinct ventricular cardiomyocyte clusters exhibit myocardial Notch activity that cell-autonomously inhibits Erbb2 signalling and prevents cardiomyocyte sprouting and trabeculation. Myocardial-specific Notch inactivation leads to ventricles of reduced size and increased wall thickness because of excessive trabeculae, whereas widespread myocardial Notch activity results in ventricles of increased size with a single-cell-thick wall but no trabeculae. Notably, this myocardial Notch signalling is activated non-cell-autonomously by neighbouring Erbb2-activated cardiomyocytes that sprout and form nascent trabeculae. Thus, these findings support an interactive cellular feedback process that guides the assembly of cardiomyocytes to morphologically create the ventricular myocardial wall and more broadly provide insight into the cellular dynamics of how diverse cell lineages organize to create form.

"Btg2 is a Negative Regulator of Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy through a Decrease in Cytosolic RNA.","Under hypertrophic stimulation, cardiomyocytes enter a hypermetabolic state and accelerate biomass accumulation. Although the molecular pathways that regulate protein levels are well-studied, the functional implications of RNA accumulation and its regulatory mechanisms in cardiomyocytes remain elusive. Here, we have elucidated the quantitative kinetics of RNA in cardiomyocytes through single cell imaging and c-Myc (Myc)-mediated hypermetabolic analytical model using cultured cardiomyocytes. Nascent RNA labeling combined with single cell imaging demonstrated that Myc protein significantly increased the amount of global RNA production per cardiomyocyte. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing clarified that overexpressed Myc bound to a specific set of genes and recruits RNA polymerase II. Among these genes, we identified Btg2 as a novel target of Myc. Btg2 overexpression significantly reduced cardiomyocyte surface area. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Btg2 accelerated adrenergic stimulus-induced hypertrophy. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we determined that Btg2 binds a series of proteins that comprise mRNA deadenylation complexes. Intriguingly, Btg2 specifically suppresses cytosolic, but not nuclear, RNA levels. Btg2 knockdown further enhances cytosolic RNA accumulation in cardiomyocytes under adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that Btg2 negatively regulates reactive hypertrophy by negatively regulating RNA accumulation. Our findings provide insight into the functional significance of the mechanisms regulating RNA levels in cardiomyocytes.","Scientific reports","27346836",2016,"England"
"Estimability Analysis and Optimal Design in Dynamic Multi-scale Models of Cardiac Electrophysiology.","We present an applied approach to optimal experimental design and estimability analysis for mechanistic models of cardiac electrophysiology, by extending and improving on existing computational and graphical methods. These models are 'multi-scale' in the sense that the modeled phenomena occur over multiple spatio-temporal scales (e.g., single cell vs. whole heart). As a consequence, empirical observations of multi-scale phenomena often require multiple distinct experimental procedures. We discuss the use of conventional optimal design criteria (e.g., D-optimality) in combining experimental observations across multiple scales and multiple experimental modalities. In addition, we present an improved 'sensitivity plot' - a graphical assessment of parameter estimability - that overcomes a well-known limitation in this context. These techniques are demonstrated using a working Hodgkin-Huxley cell model and three simulated experimental procedures: single cell stimulation, action potential propagation, and voltage clamp. In light of these assessments, we discuss two model modifications that improve parameter estimability, and show that the choice of optimality criterion has a profound effect on the contribution of each experiment.","Journal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics","27330268",2016,"United States"
"Implications for the role of macrophages in a model of myocardial fibrosis: CCR2(-/-) mice exhibit an M2 phenotypic shift in resident cardiac macrophages.","BACKGROUND: Macrophages (M¦µ) are functionally diverse and dynamic. Until recently, cardiac M¦µ were assumed to be monocyte derived; however, resident cardiac M¦µ (rCM¦µ), present at baseline, were identified in myocardia and have been implicated in cardiac healing. Previously, we demonstrated that CCR2(-/-) mice are protected from myocardial fibrosis - an observation initially attributed to changes in infiltrating monocytes. Here, we reexplored this observation in the context of our new understanding of rCM¦µ.METHODS: Male CCR2(-/-) and C57BL/6 hearts were digested and purified to a single cell suspension, incubated with fluorophore-linked antibodies (CCR2, CX3CR1, CD11b, Ly6C, TNF-¦Á, and IL-10), and assessed by flow cytometry. Differentiated M¦µ were cocultured with fibroblasts in order to characterize how M¦µ phenotype influences fibroblast activation. Fibroblasts were characterized for their expression of smooth muscle cell actin (SMA).RESULTS: A significant decrease in Ly6C expression was observed in the CCR2(-/-) cardiac M¦µ population relative to WT, which corresponded with significantly lower TNF-¦Á expression and significantly higher IL-10 expression. Using in vitro coculture system, classical M¦µ promoted fibroblast activation relative to nonclassical M¦µ.CONCLUSION: CCR2(-/-) rCM¦µ favor a more antiinflammatory phenotype relative to WT controls. Moreover, a shift toward the antiinflammatory promotes proliferation, but not activation in vitro. Together, these observations suggest that antiinflammatory cardiac M¦µ populations may inhibit myocardial fibrosis in a pathological setting by preventing the activation of fibroblasts.NEWS AND NOTEWORTHY: Here, we provide novel evidence for baseline differences in rCM¦µ phenotypes (i.e. classical vs. nonclassical) and how these differences could modulate cardiac healing. Importantly, we observed differences in how classical vs. nonclassical M¦µ influenced fibroblast activation, which could, in turn, affect fibrosis.","Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology","27327107",2016,"United States"

"Bioavailability of catechins from guaran¨¢ (Paullinia cupana) and its effect on antioxidant enzymes and other oxidative stress markers in healthy human subjects.","We assessed the effects of guaran¨¢ (Paullinia cupana) consumption on plasma catechins, erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and biomarkers of oxidative stress (ex vivo LDL oxidation, plasma total antioxidant status and ORAC, and lymphocyte single cell gel electrophoresis) in healthy overweight subjects. Twelve participants completed a 15-day run-in period followed by a 15-day intervention with a daily intake of 3 g guaran¨¢ seed powder containing 90 mg (+)-catechin and 60 mg (-)-epicatechin. Blood samples were taken on the first and last day of the intervention period, fasting and 1 h post-dose. The administration of guaran¨¢ increased plasma ORAC, while reducing ex vivo LDL oxidation (only in the first study day) and hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes, at 1 h post-dose. Plasma catechin (0.38 ¡À 0.12 and 0.44 ¡À 0.18 nmol mL(-1)), epicatechin (0.59 ¡À 0.18 and 0.64 ¡À 0.25 nmol mL(-1)) and their methylated metabolites were observed at 1 h post-dose but were almost negligible after overnight fasting. The activities of catalase (in both study days) and glutathione peroxidase (in the last intervention day) increased at 1 h post-dose. Furthermore, the activity of both enzymes remained higher than the basal levels in overnight-fasting individuals on the last intervention day, suggesting a prolonged effect of guaran¨¢ that continues even after plasma catechin clearance. In conclusion, guaran¨¢ catechins are bioavailable and contribute to reduce the oxidative stress of clinically healthy individuals, by direct antioxidant action of the absorbed phytochemicals and up-regulation of antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes.

"Quantifying intrinsic and extrinsic control of single-cell fates in cancer and stem/progenitor cell pedigrees with competing risks analysis.","The molecular control of cell fate and behaviour is a central theme in biology. Inherent heterogeneity within cell populations requires that control of cell fate is studied at the single-cell level. Time-lapse imaging and single-cell tracking are powerful technologies for acquiring cell lifetime data, allowing quantification of how cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors control single-cell fates over time. However, cell lifetime data contain complex features. Competing cell fates, censoring, and the possible inter-dependence of competing fates, currently present challenges to modelling cell lifetime data. Thus far such features are largely ignored, resulting in loss of data and introducing a source of bias. Here we show that competing risks and concordance statistics, previously applied to clinical data and the study of genetic influences on life events in twins, respectively, can be used to quantify intrinsic and extrinsic control of single-cell fates. Using these statistics we demonstrate that 1) breast cancer cell fate after chemotherapy is dependent on p53 genotype; 2) granulocyte macrophage progenitors and their differentiated progeny have concordant fates; and 3) cytokines promote self-renewal of cardiac mesenchymal stem cells by symmetric divisions. Therefore, competing risks and concordance statistics provide a robust and unbiased approach for evaluating hypotheses at the single-cell level.","Scientific reports","27250534",2016,"England"

"Directed Differentiation of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells to Mesenchymal Stem Cells.","Multipotent stromal cells, also known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), possess great potential to generate a wide range of cell types including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, bone, cartilage, and lipid cells. This protocol describes in detail how to perform highly efficient, lineage-specific differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with an MSCs fate. The approach uses a clinically compliant protocol with chemically defined media, feeder-free conditions, and a CD105 positive and CD24 negative selection to achieve a single cell-based MSCs derivation from differentiating human pluripotent cells in approximately 20 days. Cells generated with this protocol express typical MSCs surface markers and undergo adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis similar to adult bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). Nonetheless, compared with adult BM-MSCs, iPSC-MSCs display a higher proliferative capacity, up to 120 passages, without obvious loss of self-renewal potential and constitutively express MSCs surface antigens. MSCs generated with this protocol have numerous applications, including expansion to large scale cell numbers for tissue engineering and the development of cellular therapeutics. This approach has been used to rescue limb ischemia, allergic disorders, and cigarette smoke-induced lung damage and to model mesenchymal and vascular disorders of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","27236679",2016,"United States"
"Calcium Wave Propagation Triggered by Local Mechanical Stimulation as a Method for Studying Gap Junctions and Hemichannels.","Intercellular communication is essential for the coordination and synchronization of cellular processes. Gap junction channels play an important role to communicate between cells and organs, including the brain, lung, liver, lens, retina, and heart. Gap junctions enable a direct route for ions like calcium and potassium, and low molecular weight compounds, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and various kinds of metabolites to pass between cells. Intercellular calcium wave propagation evoked by a local mechanical stimulus is one of the gap junction assays to study intercellular communication. In experimental settings, an intercellular calcium wave can be elicited by applying a mechanical stimulus to a single cell. Here, we describe the use of monolayers of primary bovine corneal endothelial cells as a model to study intercellular communication. Calcium wave propagation was assayed by imaging fluorescent calcium in bovine corneal endothelial cells loaded with a fluorescent calcium dye using a confocal microscope. Spatial changes in intercellular calcium concentration following mechanical stimulation were measured in the mechanical stimulated cell and in the neighboring cells. The active area (i.e., total surface area of responsive cells) of a calcium wave can be measured and used for studying the function and regulation of gap junction channels as well as hemichannels in a variety of cell systems.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","27207297",2016,"United States"
"High-throughput drug profiling with voltage- and calcium-sensitive fluorescent probes in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.","Cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are increasingly used for in vitro assays and represent an interesting opportunity to increase the data throughput for drug development. In this work, we describe a 96-well recording of synchronous electrical activities from spontaneously beating hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte monolayers. The signal was obtained with a fast-imaging plate reader using a submillisecond-responding membrane potential recording assay, FluoVolt, based on a newly derived voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye. In our conditions, the toxicity of the dye was moderate and compatible with episodic recordings for &gt;3 h. We show that the waveforms recorded from a whole well or from a single cell-sized zone are equivalent and make available critical functional parameters that are usually accessible only with gold standard techniques like intracellular microelectrode recording. This approach allows accurate identification of the electrophysiological effects of reference drugs on the different phases of the cardiac action potential as follows: fast depolarization (lidocaine), early repolarization (nifedipine, Bay K8644, and veratridine), late repolarization (dofetilide), and diastolic slow depolarization (ivabradine). Furthermore, the data generated with the FluoVolt dye can be pertinently complemented with a calcium-sensitive dye for deeper characterization of the pharmacological responses. In a semiautomated plate reader, the two probes used simultaneously in 96-well plates provide an easy and powerful multiparametric assay to rapidly and precisely evaluate the cardiotropic profile of compounds for drug discovery or cardiac safety.","American journal of physiology.

After treatment, the hypertrophic responses of cardiomyocytes were assessed by measuring cell diameter, detecting protein synthesis, and single-cell protein content. The concentrations of hypertrophic markers such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured by ELISA. Protein expressions of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and Ras were detected by western blotting.

"FKBPs facilitate the termination of spontaneous Ca2+ release in wild-type<U+00A0>RyR2 but not CPVT mutant RyR2.","FK506-binding proteins 12.6 (FKBP12.6) and 12 (FKBP12) tightly associate with the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Studies suggest that dissociation of FKBP12.6 from mutant forms of RyR2 contributes to store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and Ca(2+)-triggered arrhythmias. However, these findings are controversial. Previous studies focused on the effect of FKBP12.6 on the initiation of SOICR and did not explore changes in the termination of Ca(2+) release. Less is known about FKBP12. We aimed to determine the effect of FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 on the termination of SOICR. Using single-cell imaging, in cells expressing wild-type RyR2, we found that FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 significantly increase the termination threshold of SOICR without changing the activation threshold of SOICR. This effect, dependent on the association of each FKBP with RyR2, reduced the magnitude of Ca(2+) release but had no effect on the propensity for SOICR. In contrast, neither FKBP12.6 nor FKBP12 was able to regulate an arrhythmogenic variant of RyR2, despite a conserved protein interaction. Our results suggest that both FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 play critical roles in regulating RyR2 function by facilitating the termination of SOICR. The inability of FKBPs to mediate a similar effect on the mutant RyR2 represents a novel mechanism by which mutations within RyR2 lead to arrhythmia.","The Biochemical journal","27154203",2016,"England"
"STIM1-dependent Ca(2+) microdomains are required for myofilament remodeling and signaling in the heart.","In non-excitable cells stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a key element in the generation of Ca(2+) signals that lead to gene expression, migration and cell proliferation. A growing body of literature suggests that STIM1 plays a key role in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. However, the precise mechanisms involving STIM-dependent Ca(2+) signaling in the heart are not clearly established. Here, we have investigated the STIM1-associated Ca(2+) signals in cardiomyocytes and their relevance to pathological cardiac remodeling. We show that mice with inducible, cardiac-restricted, ablation of STIM1 exhibited left ventricular reduced contractility, which was corroborated by impaired single cell contractility. The spatial properties of STIM1-dependent Ca(2+) signals determine restricted Ca(2+) microdomains that regulate myofilament remodeling and activate spatially segregated pro-hypertrophic factors. Indeed, mice lacking STIM1 showed less adverse structural remodeling in response to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. These results highlight how STIM1-dependent Ca(2+) microdomains have a major impact on intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, cytoskeletal remodeling and cellular signaling, even when excitation-contraction coupling is present.","Scientific reports","27150728",2016,"United States"
"Single-cell profiling of human megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors identifies distinct megakaryocyte and erythroid differentiation pathways.","BACKGROUND: Recent advances in single-cell techniques have provided the opportunity to finely dissect cellular heterogeneity within populations previously defined by &quot;bulk&quot; assays and to uncover rare cell types. In human hematopoiesis, megakaryocytes and erythroid cells differentiate from a shared precursor, the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP), which remains poorly defined.RESULTS: To clarify the cellular pathway in erythro-megakaryocyte differentiation, we correlate the surface immunophenotype, transcriptional profile, and differentiation potential of individual MEP cells. Highly purified, single MEP cells were analyzed using index fluorescence-activated cell sorting and parallel targeted transcriptional profiling of the same cells was performed using a specifically designed panel of genes. Differentiation potential was tested in novel, single-cell differentiation assays. Our results demonstrate that immunophenotypic MEP comprise three distinct subpopulations: &quot;Pre-MEP,&quot; enriched for erythroid/megakaryocyte progenitors but with residual myeloid differentiation capacity; &quot;E-MEP,&quot; strongly biased towards erythroid differentiation; and &quot;MK-MEP,&quot; a previously undescribed, rare population of cells that are bipotent but primarily generate megakaryocytic progeny. Therefore, conventionally defined MEP are a mixed population, as a minority give rise to mixed-lineage colonies while the majority of cells are transcriptionally primed to generate exclusively single-lineage output.CONCLUSIONS: Our study clarifies the cellular hierarchy in human megakaryocyte/erythroid lineage commitment and highlights the importance of using a combination of single-cell approaches to dissect cellular heterogeneity and identify rare cell types within a population. We present a novel immunophenotyping strategy that enables the prospective identification of specific intermediate progenitor populations in erythro-megakaryopoiesis, allowing for in-depth study of disorders including inherited cytopenias, myeloproliferative disorders, and erythromegakaryocytic leukemias.","Genome biology","27142433",2016,"United Kingdom"

It is not established whether Mesp1-induced mesoderm cells are intrinsically heterogeneous, or are simply capable of multiple lineage decisions. In the current study, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to analyze Mesp1+ mesoderm. Initial whole transcriptome analysis showed a surprising homogeneity among Mesp1-induced mesoderm cells. However, this apparent global homogeneity masked an intrinsic heterogeneity revealed by interrogating a panel of early mesoderm patterning factors. This approach enabled discovery of subpopulations primed for hematopoietic or cardiac development. These studies demonstrate the heterogeneic nature of Mesp1+ mesoderm.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","27131741",2016,"United States"
"Cardiac Non-myocyte Cells Show Enhanced Pharmacological Function Suggestive of Contractile Maturity in Stem Cell Derived Cardiomyocyte Microtissues.","The immature phenotype of stem cell derived cardiomyocytes is a significant barrier to their use in translational medicine and pre-clinical in vitro drug toxicity and pharmacological analysis. Here we have assessed the contribution of non-myocyte cells on the contractile function of co-cultured human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in spheroid microtissue format. Microtissues were formed using a scaffold free 96-well cell suspension method from hESC-CM cultured alone (CM microtissues) or in combination with human primary cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts (CMEF microtissues). Contractility was characterized with fluorescence and video-based edge detection. CMEF microtissues displayed greater Ca(2+<U+2009>)transient amplitudes, enhanced spontaneous contraction rate and remarkably enhanced contractile function in response to both positive and negative inotropic drugs, suggesting a more mature contractile phenotype than CM microtissues. In addition, for several drugs the enhanced contractile response was not apparent when endothelial cell or fibroblasts from a non-cardiac tissue were used as the ancillary cells. Further evidence of maturity for CMEF microtissues was shown with increased expression of genes that encode proteins critical in cardiac Ca(2+<U+2009>)handling (S100A1), sarcomere assembly (telethonin/TCAP) and ¦Â-adrenergic receptor signalling. Our data shows that compared with single cell-type cardiomyocyte in vitro models, CMEF microtissues are superior at predicting the inotropic effects of drugs, demonstrating the critical contribution of cardiac non-myocyte cells in mediating functional cardiotoxicity.","Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology","27125969",2016,"United Kingdom"
"Ultrasound modulates ion channel currents.","Transcranial focused ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to stimulate neurons in animals and humans, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. It has been hypothesized that US, a mechanical stimulus, may mediate cellular discharge by activating mechanosensitive ion channels embedded within cellular membranes. To test this hypothesis, we expressed potassium and sodium mechanosensitive ion channels (channels of the two-pore-domain potassium family (K2P) including TREK-1, TREK-2, TRAAK; NaV1.5) in the Xenopus oocyte system. Focused US (10<U+2009>MHz, 0.3-4.9<U+2009>W/cm(2)) modulated the currents flowing through the ion channels on average by up to 23%, depending on channel and stimulus intensity. The effects were reversible upon repeated stimulation and were abolished when a channel blocker (ranolazine to block NaV1.5, BaCl2 to block K2P channels) was applied to the solution. These data reveal at the single cell level that focused US modulates the activity of specific ion channels to mediate transmembrane currents. These findings open doors to investigations of the effects of <U+2009>US on ion channels expressed in neurons, retinal cells, or cardiac cells, which may lead to important medical applications. The findings may also pave the way to the development of sonogenetics: a non-invasive, US-based analogue of optogenetics.","Scientific reports","27112990",2016,"United States"
"Microtissues in Cardiovascular Medicine: Regenerative Potential Based on a 3D Microenvironment.","More people die annually from cardiovascular diseases than from any other cause. In particular, patients who suffer from myocardial infarction may be affected by ongoing adverse remodeling processes of the heart that may ultimately lead to heart failure. The introduction of stem and progenitor cell-based applications has raised substantial hope for reversing these processes and inducing cardiac regeneration. However, current stem cell therapies using single-cell suspensions have failed to demonstrate long-lasting efficacy due to the overall low retention rate after cell delivery to the myocardium. To overcome this obstacle, the concept of 3D cell culture techniques has been proposed to enhance therapeutic efficacy and cell engraftment based on the simulation of an in vivo-like microenvironment. Of great interest is the use of so-called microtissues or spheroids, which have evolved from their traditional role as in vitro models to their novel role as therapeutic agents. This review will provide an overview of the therapeutic potential of microtissues by addressing primarily cardiovascular regeneration. It will accentuate their advantages compared to other regenerative approaches and summarize the methods for generating clinically applicable microtissues. In addition, this review will illustrate the unique properties of the microenvironment within microtissues that makes them a promising next-generation therapeutic approach.

"Increased Late Sodium Current Contributes to the Electrophysiological Effects of Chronic, but Not Acute, Dofetilide Administration.","BACKGROUND: Drugs are screened for delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) blockade to predict long QT syndrome prolongation and arrhythmogenesis. However, single-cell studies have shown that chronic (hours) exposure to some IKr blockers (eg, dofetilide) prolongs repolarization additionally by increasing late sodium current (INa-L) via inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. We hypothesized that chronic dofetilide administration to intact dogs prolongs repolarization by blocking IKr and increasing INa-L.METHODS AND RESULTS: We continuously infused dofetilide (6-9 ¦Ìg/kg bolus+6-9 ¦Ìg/kg per hour IV infusion) into anesthetized dogs for 7 hours, maintaining plasma levels within the therapeutic range. In separate experiments, myocardial biopsies were taken before and during 6-hour intravenous dofetide infusion, and the level of phospho-Akt was determined. Acute and chronic dofetilide effects on action potential duration (APD) were studied in canine left ventricular subendocardial slabs using microelectrode techniques. Dofetilide monotonically increased QTc and APD throughout 6.5-hour exposure. Dofetilide infusion during ¡Ý210 minutes inhibited Akt phosphorylation. INa-L block with lidocaine shortened QTc and APD more at 6.5 hours than at 50 minutes (QTc) or 30 minutes (APD) dofetilide administration. In comparison, moxifloxacin, an IKr blocker with no effects on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and INa-L prolonged APD acutely but no additional prolongation occurred on chronic superfusion. Lidocaine shortened APD equally during acute and chronic moxifloxacin superfusion.CONCLUSIONS: Increased INa-L contributes to chronic dofetilide effects in vivo. These data emphasize the need to include time and INa-L in evaluating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition-derived proarrhythmic potential of drugs and provide a mechanism for benefit from lidocaine administration in clinical acquired long QT syndrome.","Circulation.

"Single-Cell Lineage Tracing Reveals that Oriented Cell Division Contributes to Trabecular Morphogenesis and Regional Specification.","The cardiac trabeculae are sheet-like structures extending from the myocardium that function to increase surface area. A lack of trabeculation causes embryonic lethality due to compromised cardiac function. To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of trabecular formation, we genetically labeled individual cardiomyocytes prior to trabeculation via the brainbow multicolor system and traced and analyzed the labeled cells during trabeculation by whole-embryo clearing and imaging. The clones derived from labeled single cells displayed four different geometric patterns that are derived from different patterns of oriented cell division (OCD) and migration. Of the four types of clones, the inner, transmural, and mixed clones contributed to trabecular cardiomyocytes. Further studies showed that perpendicular OCD is an extrinsic asymmetric cell division that putatively contributes to trabecular regional specification. Furthermore, N-Cadherin deletion in labeled clones disrupted the clonal patterns. In summary, our data demonstrate that OCD contributes to trabecular morphogenesis and specification.

"Expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 2 in human thymus.","11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 2 (11¦Â-HSD2) is a high affinity dehydrogenase which rapidly inactivates physiologically-active glucocorticoids to protect key tissues. 11¦Â-HSD2 expression has been described in peripheral cells of the innate and the adaptive immune system as well as in murine thymus. In absence of knowledge of 11¦Â-HSD2 expression in human thymus, the study aimed to localize 11¦Â-HSD2 in human thymic tissue. Thymic tissue was taken of six healthy, non-immunologically impaired male infants below 12months of age with congenital heart defects who had to undergo correction surgery. 11¦Â-HSD2 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Kidney tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were taken as positive controls. Significant expression of 11¦Â-HSD2 protein was found at single cell level in thymus parenchyma, at perivascular sites of capillaries and small vessels penetrating the thymus lobuli and within Hassall's bodies. The present study demonstrates that 11¦Â-HSD2 is expressed in human thymus with predominant perivascular expression and also within Hassall's bodies. To our knowledge, this is the first report confirming 11¦Â-HSD2 expression at the protein level in human thymic tissue underlining a potential role of this enzyme in regulating glucocorticoid function at the thymic level.","Steroids","27025972",2016,"United States"
"Isolation and Characterization of Single Cells from Zebrafish Embryos.","The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful model organism to study vertebrate development. Though many aspects of zebrafish embryonic development have been described at the morphological level, little is known about the molecular basis of cellular changes that occur as the organism develops. With recent advancements in microfluidics and multiplexing technologies, it is now possible to characterize gene expression in single cells. This allows for investigation of heterogeneity between individual cells of specific cell populations to identify and classify cell subtypes, characterize intermediate states that occur during cell differentiation, and explore differential cellular responses to stimuli. This study describes a protocol to isolate viable, single cells from zebrafish embryos for high throughput multiplexing assays. This method may be rapidly applied to any zebrafish embryonic cell type with fluorescent markers. An extension of this method may also be used in combination with high throughput sequencing technologies to fully characterize the transcriptome of single cells. As proof of principle, the relative abundance of cardiac differentiation markers was assessed in isolated, single cells derived from nkx2.5 positive cardiac progenitors. By evaluation of gene expression at the single cell level and at a single time point, the data support a model in which cardiac progenitors coexist with differentiating progeny. The method and work flow described here is broadly applicable to the zebrafish research community, requiring only a labeled transgenic fish line and access to microfluidics technologies.

"Surface Chemistry and Microtopography of Parylene C Films Control the Morphology and Microtubule Density of Cardiac Myocytes.","Cell micropatterning has certainly proved to improve the morphological and physiological properties of cardiomyocytes in vitro; however, there is little knowledge on the single cell-scaffold interactions that influence the cells' development and differentiation in culture. In this study, we employ hydrophobic/hydrophilic micropatterned Parylene C thin films (2-10<U+2009>¦Ìm) as cell microscaffolds that can control the morphology and microtubule density of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) by regulating their adhesion area on Parylene through a thickness-dependent hydrophobicity. Structured NRVM on thin films tend to bridge across the hydrophobic areas, demonstrating a more spread-out shape and sparser microtubule organization, while cells on thicker films adopt a cylindrical (in vivo-like) shape (contact angles at the level of the nucleus are 64.51¡ã and 84.73¡ã, respectively) and a significantly (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) denser microtubule structure. Ion scanning microscopy on NRVM revealed that cells on thicker membranes were significantly (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) smaller in volume, but more elongated. The cylindrical shape and a significantly denser microtubule structure indicate the ability to influence cardiomyocyte phenotype using patterning and manipulation of hydrophilicity. These combined bioengineering strategies are promising tools in the generation of more representative cardiomyocytes in culture.","Tissue engineering.

"Dendritic Cells in the Context of Human Tumors: Biology and Experimental Tools.","Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent and versatile antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the immune system. DC have an exceptional ability to comprehend the immune context of a captured antigen based on molecular signals identified from its vicinity. The analyzed information is then conveyed to other immune effector cells. Such capability enables DC to play a pivotal role in mediating either an immunogenic response or immune tolerance towards an acquired antigen. This review summarizes current knowledge on DC in the context of human tumors. It covers the basics of human DC biology, elaborating on the different markers, morphology and function of the different subsets of human DC. Human blood-borne DC are comprised of at least three subsets consisting of one plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and two to three myeloid DC (mDC) subsets. Some tissues have unique DC. Each subset has a different phenotype and function and may induce pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral effects. The review also discusses two methods fundamental to the research of DC on the single-cell level: multicolor flow cytometry (FCM) and image-based cytometry (IC). These methods, along with new genomics and proteomics tools, can provide high-resolution information on specific DC subsets and on immune and tumor cells with which they interact. The different layers of collected biological data may then be integrated using Immune-Cytomics modeling approaches. Such novel integrated approaches may help unravel the complex network of cellular interactions that DC carry out within tumors, and may help harness this complex immunological information into the development of more effective treatments for cancer.

"Pacemaker Created in Human Ventricle by Depressing Inward-Rectifier K<U+207A> Current: A Simulation Study.","Cardiac conduction disorders are common diseases which cause slow heart rate and syncope. The best way to treat these diseases by now is to implant electronic pacemakers, which, yet, have many disadvantages, such as the limited battery life and infection. Biopacemaker has been expected to replace the electronic devices. Automatic ventricular myocytes (VMs) could show pacemaker activity, which was induced by depressing inward-rectifier K(+) current (I K1). In this study, a 2D model of human biopacemaker was created from the ventricular endocardial myocytes. We examined the stability of the created biopacemaker and investigated its driving capability by finding the suitable size and spatial distribution of the pacemaker for robust pacing and driving the surrounding quiescent cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest that the rhythm of the pacemaker is similar to that of the single cell at final stable state. The driving force of the biopacemaker is closely related to the pattern of spatial distribution of the pacemaker. ","BioMed research international","26998484",2016,"United Kingdom"
"Single-cell RNA-seq reveals activation of unique gene groups as a consequence of stem cell-parenchymal cell fusion.","Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the recipient can occur in the brain, liver, intestine and heart following transplantation. The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown. Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. But in the case of most other gene groups, hybrids were individually distinct. In fact, though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners, approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day. Some hybrids underwent reprogramming, expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups. Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells, expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion.

"Visualizing allele-specific expression in single cells reveals epigenetic mosaicism in an H19 loss-of-imprinting mutant.","Imprinting is a classic mammalian epigenetic phenomenon that results in expression from a single parental allele. Imprinting defects can lead to inappropriate expression from the normally silenced allele, but it remains unclear whether every cell in a mutant organism follows the population average, which would have profound implications for human imprinting disorders. Here, we apply a new fluorescence in situ hybridization method that measures allele-specific expression in single cells to address this question in mutants exhibiting aberrant H19/Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) imprinting. We show that mutant primary embryonic mouse fibroblasts are comprised of two subpopulations: one expressing both H19 alleles and another expressing only the maternal copy. Only in the latter cell population is Igf2 expression detected. Furthermore, the two subpopulations are stable in that cells do not interconvert between the two expression patterns. Combined small input methylation analysis and transcriptional imaging revealed that these two mutant subpopulations exhibit distinct methylation patterns at their imprinting control regions. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation reduced the proportion of monoallelic cells. Importantly, we observed that the same two subpopulations are also present in vivo within murine cardiac tissue. Our results establish that imprinting disorders can display striking single-cell heterogeneity in their molecular phenotypes and suggest that such heterogeneity may underlie epigenetic mosaicism in human imprinting disorders.

"Three-Dimensional Tissue Models Constructed by Cells with Nanometer- or Micrometer-Sized Films on the Surfaces.","Living tissues or organ modules consist of different types of highly organized cells and extracellular matrices (ECMs) in a hierarchical manner, such as the multilayered structure of blood vessels and the radial structures of hepatic lobules. Due to animal examinations being banned in the EU since 2013 and a shortage in the demand for tissue repair or organ transplantation, the creation of artificial 3D tissues possessing specific structures and functions similar to natural tissues are key challenges in tissue engineering. To date, we have developed a simple but unique bottom-up approach, a hierarchical cell manipulation technique, with a nanometer-sized ECM matrix consisting of fibronectin (FN) and gelatin (G) on cell surfaces. About 10 nm thick FN/G ECM films on cell surfaces were coated successfully by using layer-by-layer coating methodology. Various 3D constructs with higher cell density with different types of cells were successfully constructed. In addition to the construction of tissues with higher cell densities, other tissues, such as cartilage or skin tissues, with different cell densities are also important tissue models for tissue engineering and pharmaceutical industries. Thus, we recently developed other methodologies, the collagen coating method and multiple coating method, to fabricate micrometer-sized level ECM layers on cell surfaces. Various micro- or millimeter-sized 3D constructs with lower cell densities were constructed successfully. By using these two methods, cell distances in 2D or 3D views can be controlled by different thicknesses of ECM layers on cell surfaces at the single-cell level. Both FN/G and the collagen coating method resulted in homogenous 3D tissues with a controlled layer numbers, cell type, cell location, and properties; these will be promising to achieve different goals in tissue engineering.

"Automated Electrophysiological and Pharmacological Evaluation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.","Automated planar patch clamp systems are widely used in drug evaluation studies because of their ability to provide accurate, reliable, and reproducible data in a high-throughput manner. Typically, CHO and HEK tumorigenic cell lines overexpressing single ion channels are used since they can be harvested as high-density, homogenous, single-cell suspensions. While human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) are physiologically more relevant, these cells are fragile, have complex culture requirements, are inherently heterogeneous, and are expensive to produce, which has restricted their use on automated patch clamp (APC) devices. Here, we used high efficiency differentiation protocols to produce cardiomyocytes from six different hPSC lines for analysis on the Patchliner (Nanion Technologies GmbH) APC platform. We developed a two-step cell preparation protocol that yielded cell catch rates and whole-cell breakthroughs of ¡«80%, with ¡«40% of these cells allowing electrical activity to be recorded. The protocol permitted formation of long-lasting (&gt;15 min), high quality seals (&gt;2<U+2009>G¦¸) in both voltage- and current-clamp modes.

"Reduction in Kv Current Enhances the Temporal Dispersion of the Action Potential in Diabetic Myocytes: Insights From a Novel Repolarization Algorithm.","BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram and enhanced dispersion of ventricular repolarization, factors that, together with atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia, may promote the occurrence of electrical disorders. Thus, we tested the possibility that alterations in transmembrane ionic currents reduce the repolarization reserve of myocytes, leading to action potential (AP) prolongation and enhanced beat-to-beat variability of repolarization.METHODS AND RESULTS: Diabetes was induced in mice with streptozotocin (STZ), and effects of hyperglycemia on electrical properties of whole heart and myocytes were studied with respect to an untreated control group (Ctrl) using electrocardiographic recordings in vivo, ex vivo perfused hearts, and single-cell patch-clamp analysis. Additionally, a newly developed algorithm was introduced to obtain detailed information of the impact of high glucose on AP profile. Compared to Ctrl, hyperglycemia in STZ-treated animals was coupled with prolongation of the QT interval, enhanced temporal dispersion of electrical recovery, and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, defects observed, in part, in the Akita mutant mouse model of type I diabetes. AP was prolonged and beat-to-beat variability of repolarization was enhanced in diabetic myocytes, with respect to Ctrl cells. Density of Kv K(+) and L-type Ca(2+) currents were decreased in STZ myocytes, in comparison to cells from normoglycemic mice. Pharmacological reduction of Kv currents in Ctrl cells lengthened AP duration and increased temporal dispersion of repolarization, reiterating features identified in diabetic myocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in the repolarizing K(+) currents may contribute to electrical disturbances of the diabetic heart.","Journal of the American Heart Association","26896476",2016,"United States"

In this regard, action potentials were recorded in baroreceptor neurons (BRNs) using whole-cell patch techniques; mRNA and protein expression of AT1R and AT2R in nodose ganglia and nucleus of tractus solitary were evaluated using real time-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry at both tissue and single-cell levels. The in vivo effects of 17¦Â-estradiol on blood pressure and AT2R expression were also tested. The data showed that AT2R, rather than AT1R, expression was higher in female than age-matched male rats. Moreover, AT2R was downregulated in ovariectomized rats, which was restored by the administration of 17¦Â-estradiol. Single-cell real time-polymerase chain reaction data indicated that AT2R was uniquely expressed in Ah-type BRNs. Functional study showed that long-term administration of 17¦Â-estradiol significantly alleviated the blood pressure increase in ovariectomized rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that angiotensin-II treatment increased the neuroexcitability more in Ah- than C-type BRNs, whereas no such effect was observed in A-types. In addition, angiotensin-II treatment prolonged action potential duration, which was not further changed by iberiotoxin. The density of angiotensin-II-sensitive K(+) currents recorded in Ah-types was equivalent with iberiotoxin-sensitive component. In summary, the unique, sex- and afferent-specific expression of AT2R was identified in Ah-type BRNs, and AT2R-mediated KCa1.1 inhibition in Ah-type BRNs may exert great impacts on baroreflex afferent function and blood pressure regulation in females.

"Nutrient Starvation Decreases Cx43 Levels and Limits Intercellular Communication in Primary Bovine Corneal Endothelial Cells.","Connexin (Cx) proteins form large conductance channels which function as regulators of communication between neighboring cells via gap junctions and/or hemichannels. Intercellular communication is essential to coordinate cellular responses in tissues and organs, thereby fulfilling an essential role in the spreading of signaling, survival and death processes. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a major connexin isoform in brain and heart, is rapidly turned over. Recent studies implicated that autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway induced upon nutrient starvation, mediates connexins, including Cx43, degradation. Here, we examined the impact of nutrient starvation on endogenous Cx43-protein levels and endogenous Cx43-driven intercellular communication in primary bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCECs). Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was used as a starvation condition that induces autophagic flux without impacting the survival of the BCECs. Nutrient starvation of BCECs caused a rapid decline in Cx43-protein levels, both as gap junctions and as hemichannels. The time course of the decline in Cx43-protein levels coincided with the time course of the decline in intercellular communication, assessed as intercellular Ca(2+)-wave propagation in BCECs exposed to a single-cell mechanical stimulus. The decline in Cx43-protein levels, both as gap junctions and as hemichannels, could be prevented by the addition of bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal inhibitor, during the complete nutrient starvation period. Consistent with this, bafilomycin A1 significantly alleviated the decrease in intercellular Ca(2+)-wave propagation. This study further underpins the importance of autophagy as an important degradation pathway for Cx43 proteins during periods of nutrient deprivation, thereby impacting the ability of cells to perform intercellular communication.","The Journal of membrane biology","26873723",2016,"United States"

NetrinB (NetB), a repulsive ligand for the Unc-5 receptor is required to preserve the dorsal vessel hollow. It localizes to the luminal space of the dorsal vessel but its source and its regulation is unknown. Here, using genetics together with in situ hybridization with single cell resolution, we show how tin is required for NetrinB expression in cardioblasts during DV tubulogenesis and sufficient to promote NetB transcription ectopically. We further identify a dorsal vessel-specific NetB enhancer and show that it is also regulated by tin in a similar fashion to NetB. ","PloS one","26840059",2016,"United States"
"Direct hydrogel encapsulation of pluripotent stem cells enables ontomimetic differentiation and growth of engineered human heart tissues.","Human engineered heart tissues have potential to revolutionize cardiac development research, drug-testing, and treatment of heart disease; however, implementation is limited by the need to use pre-differentiated cardiomyocytes (CMs). Here we show that by providing a 3D poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogel microenvironment, we can directly differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into contracting heart tissues. Our straight-forward, ontomimetic approach, imitating the process of development, requires only a single cell-handling step, provides reproducible results for a range of tested geometries and size scales, and overcomes inherent limitations in cell maintenance and maturation, while achieving high yields of CMs with developmentally appropriate temporal changes in gene expression. We demonstrate that hPSCs encapsulated within this biomimetic 3D hydrogel microenvironment develop into functional cardiac tissues composed of self-aligned CMs with evidence of ultrastructural maturation, mimicking heart development, and enabling investigation of disease mechanisms and screening of compounds on developing human heart tissue.

"Spearhead Nanometric Field-Effect Transistor Sensors for Single-Cell Analysis.","Nanometric field-effect-transistor (FET) sensors are made on the tip of spear-shaped dual carbon nanoelectrodes derived from carbon deposition inside double-barrel nanopipettes. The easy fabrication route allows deposition of semiconductors or conducting polymers to comprise the transistor channel. A channel from electrodeposited poly pyrrole (PPy) exhibits high sensitivity toward pH changes. This property is exploited by immobilizing hexokinase on PPy nano-FETs to give rise to a selective ATP biosensor. Extracellular pH and ATP gradients are key biochemical constituents in the microenvironment of living cells; we monitor their real-time changes in relation to cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. The highly localized detection is possible because of the high aspect ratio and the spear-like design of the nano-FET probes. The accurately positioned nano-FET sensors can detect concentration gradients in three-dimensional space, identify biochemical properties of a single living cell, and after cell membrane penetration perform intracellular measurements.

"Inducibility of human atrial fibrillation in an in silico model reflecting local acetylcholine distribution and concentration.","Vagal nerve activity has been known to play a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, it is unclear how the distribution and concentration of local acetylcholine (ACh) promotes AF. In this study, we investigated the effect of the spatial distribution and concentration of ACh on fibrillation patterns in an in silico human atrial model. A human atrial action potential model with an ACh-dependent K(+) current (IKAch) was used to examine the effect of vagal activation. A simulation of cardiac wave dynamics was performed in a realistic 3D model of the atrium. A model of the ganglionated plexus (GP) and nerve was developed based on the &quot;octopus hypothesis&quot;. The pattern of cardiac wave dynamics was examined by applying vagal activation to the GP areas or randomly. AF inducibility in the octopus hypothesis-based GP and nerve model was tested. The effect of the ACh concentration level was also examined. In the single cell simulation, an increase in the ACh concentration shortened APD90 and increased the maximal slope of the restitution curve. In the 3D simulation, a random distribution of vagal activation promoted wavebreaks while ACh secretion limited to the GP areas did not induce a noticeable change in wave dynamics. The octopus hypothesis-based model of the GP and nerve exhibited AF inducibility at higher ACh concentrations. In conclusion, a 3D in silico model of the GP and parasympathetic nerve based on the octopus model exhibited higher AF inducibility with higher ACh concentrations.

"Modeling our understanding of the His-Purkinje system.","The His-Purkinje System (HPS) is responsible for the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles. It relays electrical impulses from the atrioventricular node to the muscle cells and, thus, coordinates the contraction of ventricles in order to ensure proper cardiac pump function. The HPS has been implicated in the genesis of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation as a source of ectopic beats, as well as forming distinct portions of reentry circuitry. Despite its importance, it remains much less well characterized, structurally and functionally, than the myocardium. Notably, important differences exist with regard to cell structure and electrophysiology, including ion channels, intracellular calcium handling, and gap junctions. Very few computational models address the HPS, and the majority of organ level modeling studies omit it. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of structure and function (including electrophysiology) of the HPS. We will review the most recent advances in modeling of the system from the single cell to the organ level, with considerations for relevant interspecies distinctions.

"Quantifying Drug-Induced Nanomechanics and Mechanical Effects to Single Cardiomyocytes for Optimal Drug Administration To Minimize Cardiotoxicity.","Contrary to the well-studied dynamics and mechanics at organ and tissue levels, there is still a lack of good understanding for single cell dynamics and mechanics. Single cell dynamics and mechanics may act as an interface to provide unique information reflecting activities at the organ and tissue levels. This research was aimed at quantifying doxorubicin- and dexrazoxane-induced nanomechanics and mechanical effects to single cardiomyocytes, to reveal the therapeutic effectiveness of drugs at the single cell level and to optimize drug administration for reducing cardiotoxicity. This work employed a nanoinstrumentation platform, including a digital holographic microscope combined with an atomic force microscope, which can characterize cell stiffness and beating dynamics in response to drug exposures in real time and obtain time-dose-dependent effects of cardiotoxicity and protection. Through this research, an acute increase and a delayed decrease of surface beating force induced by doxorubicin was characterized. Dexrazoxane treated cells maintained better beating force and mechanical functions than cells without any treatment, which demonstrated cardioprotective effects of dexrazoxane. In addition, combined drug effects were quantitatively evaluated following various drug administration protocols. Preadministration of dexrazoxane was demonstrated to have protective effects against doxorubicin, which could lead to better strategies for cardiotoxicity prevention and anticancer drug administration. This study concluded that quantification of nanomechanics and mechanical effects at the single cell level could offer unique insights of molecular mechanisms involved in cellular activities influencing organ and tissue level responses to drug exposure, providing a new opportunity for the development of effective and time-dose-dependent strategies of drug administration.

"Role of atrium in automaticity of the sinus node.","As the electrical source of hearts, sino-atrial node cells (SANCs) play significant roles in rhythmic firings. Due to the complex structure and function of SANCs, electrical interactions of SAN and its surrounding atrium has not yet been fully understood. The aim of the present study is to investigate effects of coupling conductance between SAN and atrial cells as well as the ectopic beats in atrium on automaticity of the SAN by computer simulation methods. On the basis of a dynamic mathematical single cell model considering the heterogeneity of central and peripheral SANCs, a two-dimensional inhomogeneous tissue slice including SAN and atrium was developed. The operator splitting method was used to integrate the tissue model. The results demonstrated that the coupling conductance between SAN and atrium had effects on the direction of spontaneous action potential conduction in SAN. Weak coupling resulted in a shift of the earliest pacemaker site from central to peripheral SANCs. Additionally, the ectopic beat-induced excitation in atrium was found to be able to enter into and overdrive suppress the automaticity of SAN. Even if the ectopic beat was delivered after the spontaneous firing had started in central SANCs, the spontaneous conduction toward the periphery could also be suppressed by the retrograde activation from the entering atrial depolarization wave. These findings suggested a direct link between sinus node dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias, and therefore were helpful in explaining the role of atrium in sinus node dysfunction.

"Cell-specific Dynamic Clamp analysis of the role of funny If current in cardiac pacemaking.","We used the Dynamic Clamp technique for i) comparative validation of conflicting computational models of the hyperpolarization-activated funny current, If, and ii) quantification of the role of If in mediating autonomic modulation of heart rate. Experimental protocols based on the injection of a real-time recalculated synthetic If current in sinoatrial rabbit cells were developed. Preliminary results of experiments mimicking the autonomic modulation of If demonstrated the need for a customization procedure to compensate for cellular heterogeneity. For this reason, we used a cell-specific approach, scaling the maximal conductance of the injected current based on the cell's spontaneous firing rate. The pacemaking rate, which was significantly reduced after application of Ivabradine, was restored by the injection of synthetic current based on the Severi-DiFrancesco formulation, while the injection of synthetic current based on the Maltsev-Lakatta formulation did not produce any significant variation. A positive virtual shift of the If activation curve, mimicking the Isoprenaline effects, led to a significant increase in pacemaking rate (+17.3<U+00A0>¡À<U+00A0>6.7%, p<U+00A0>&lt;<U+00A0>0.01), although of lower magnitude than that induced by real Isoprenaline (+45.0<U+00A0>¡À<U+00A0>26.1%). Similarly, a negative virtual shift of the activation curve significantly lowered the pacemaking rate (-11.8<U+00A0>¡À<U+00A0>1.9%, p<U+00A0>&lt;<U+00A0>0.001), as did the application of real Acetylcholine (-20.5<U+00A0>¡À<U+00A0>5.1%). The Dynamic Clamp approach, applied to the If study in cardiomyocytes for the first time and rate-adapted to manage intercellular variability, indicated that: i) the quantitative description of the If current in the Severi-DiFrancesco model accurately reproduces the effects of the real current on rabbit sinoatrial cell pacemaking rate and ii) a significant portion (50-60%) of the physiological autonomic rate modulation is due to the shift of the If activation curve.

"Epigenomic Reprogramming of Adult Cardiomyocyte-Derived Cardiac Progenitor Cells.","It has been believed that mammalian adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) are terminally-differentiated and are unable to proliferate. Recently, using a bi-transgenic ACM fate mapping mouse model and an in vitro culture system, we demonstrated that adult mouse cardiomyocytes were able to dedifferentiate into cardiac progenitor-like cells (CPCs). However, little is known about the molecular basis of their intrinsic cellular plasticity. Here we integrate single-cell transcriptome and whole-genome DNA methylation analyses to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and cell cycle reentry of mouse ACMs. Compared to parental cardiomyocytes, dedifferentiated mouse cardiomyocyte-derived CPCs (mCPCs) display epigenomic reprogramming with many differentially-methylated regions, both hypermethylated and hypomethylated, across the entire genome. Correlated well with the methylome, our transcriptomic data showed that the genes encoding cardiac structure and function proteins are remarkably down-regulated in mCPCs, while those for cell cycle, proliferation, and stemness are significantly up-regulated. In addition, implantation of mCPCs into infarcted mouse myocardium improves cardiac function with augmented left ventricular ejection fraction. Our study demonstrates that the cellular plasticity of mammalian cardiomyocytes is the result of a well-orchestrated epigenomic reprogramming and a subsequent global transcriptomic alteration.

"Single epicardial cell transcriptome sequencing identifies Caveolin 1 as an essential factor in zebrafish heart regeneration.","In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish have a high capacity to regenerate damaged or lost myocardium through proliferation of cardiomyocytes spared from damage. The epicardial sheet covering the heart is activated by injury and aids muscle regeneration through paracrine effects and as a multipotent cell source, and has received recent attention as a target in cardiac repair strategies. Although it is recognized that epicardium is required for muscle regeneration and itself has high regenerative potential, the extent of cellular heterogeneity within epicardial tissue is largely unexplored. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis on dozens of epicardial lineage cells purified from zebrafish harboring a transgenic reporter for the pan-epicardial gene tcf21. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested the presence of at least three epicardial cell subsets defined by expression signatures. We validated many new pan-epicardial and epicardial markers by alternative expression assays. Additionally, we explored the function of the scaffolding protein and main component of caveolae, caveolin 1 (cav1), which was present in each epicardial subset. In BAC transgenic zebrafish, cav1 regulatory sequences drove strong expression in ostensibly all epicardial cells and in coronary vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, cav1 mutant zebrafish generated by genome editing showed grossly normal heart development and adult cardiac anatomy, but displayed profound defects in injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. Our study defines a new platform for the discovery of epicardial lineage markers, genetic tools, and mechanisms of heart regeneration.","Development (Cambridge, England)","26657776",2015,"United States"
"Integrated Analysis of Contractile Kinetics, Force Generation, and Electrical Activity in Single Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.","The quantitative analysis of cardiomyocyte function is essential for stem cell-based approaches for the in vitro study of human cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. We present a method to comprehensively assess the function of single human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hPSC-CMs) through simultaneous quantitative analysis of contraction kinetics, force generation, and electrical activity. We demonstrate that statistical analysis of movies of contracting hPSC-CMs can be used to quantify changes in cellular morphology over time and compute contractile kinetics. Using a biomechanical model that incorporates substrate stiffness, we calculate cardiomyocyte force generation at single-cell resolution and validate this approach with conventional traction force microscopy. The addition of fluorescent calcium indicators or membrane potential dyes allows the simultaneous analysis of contractility and calcium handling or action potential morphology. Accordingly, our approach has the potential for broad application in the study of cardiac disease, drug discovery, and cardiotoxicity screening.","Stem cell reports","26626178",2015,"United States"
"Differential Expression Levels of Integrin ¦Á6 Enable the Selective Identification and Isolation of Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes.","RATIONALE: Central questions such as cardiomyocyte subtype emergence during cardiogenesis or the availability of cardiomyocyte subtypes for cell replacement therapy require selective identification and purification of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. However, current methodologies do not allow for a transgene-free selective isolation of atrial or ventricular cardiomyocytes due to the lack of subtype specific cell surface markers.METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to develop cell surface marker-based isolation procedures for cardiomyocyte subtypes, we performed an antibody-based screening on embryonic mouse hearts. Our data indicate that atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes are characterized by differential expression of integrin ¦Á6 (ITGA6) throughout development and in the adult heart. We discovered that the expression level of this surface marker correlates with the intracellular subtype-specific expression of MLC-2a and MLC-2v on the single cell level and thereby enables the discrimination of cardiomyocyte subtypes by flow cytometry. Based on the differential expression of ITGA6 in atria and ventricles during cardiogenesis, we developed purification protocols for atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes from mouse hearts. Atrial and ventricular identities of sorted cells were confirmed by expression profiling and patch clamp analysis.CONCLUSION: Here, we introduce a non-genetic, antibody-based approach to specifically isolate highly pure and viable atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes from mouse hearts of various developmental stages. This will facilitate in-depth characterization of the individual cellular subsets and support translational research applications.","PloS one","26618511",2015,"United States"
"Genome-wide detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells and FFPE tissue samples.","DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian cells. Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G&gt;C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.

"A 2D Electromechanical Model of Human Atrial Tissue Using the Discrete Element Method.","Cardiac tissue is a syncytium of coupled cells with pronounced intrinsic discrete nature. Previous models of cardiac electromechanics often ignore such discrete properties and treat cardiac tissue as a continuous medium, which has fundamental limitations. In the present study, we introduce a 2D electromechanical model for human atrial tissue based on the discrete element method (DEM). In the model, single-cell dynamics are governed by strongly coupling the electrophysiological model of Courtemanche et al. to the myofilament model of Rice et al. with two-way feedbacks. Each cell is treated as a viscoelastic body, which is physically represented by a clump of nine particles. Cell aggregations are arranged so that the anisotropic nature of cardiac tissue due to fibre orientations can be modelled. Each cell is electrically coupled to neighbouring cells, allowing excitation waves to propagate through the tissue. Cell-to-cell mechanical interactions are modelled using a linear contact bond model in DEM. By coupling cardiac electrophysiology with mechanics via the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, the DEM model successfully simulates the conduction of cardiac electrical waves and the tissue's corresponding mechanical contractions. The developed DEM model is numerically stable and provides a powerful method for studying the electromechanical coupling problem in the heart.

"Parallel Optimization of 3D Cardiac Electrophysiological Model Using GPU.","Large-scale 3D virtual heart model simulations are highly demanding in computational resources. This imposes a big challenge to the traditional computation resources based on CPU environment, which already cannot meet the requirement of the whole computation demands or are not easily available due to expensive costs. GPU as a parallel computing environment therefore provides an alternative to solve the large-scale computational problems of whole heart modeling. In this study, using a 3D sheep atrial model as a test bed, we developed a GPU-based simulation algorithm to simulate the conduction of electrical excitation waves in the 3D atria. In the GPU algorithm, a multicellular tissue model was split into two components: one is the single cell model (ordinary differential equation) and the other is the diffusion term of the monodomain model (partial differential equation). Such a decoupling enabled realization of the GPU parallel algorithm. Furthermore, several optimization strategies were proposed based on the features of the virtual heart model, which enabled a 200-fold speedup as compared to a CPU implementation. In conclusion, an optimized GPU algorithm has been developed that provides an economic and powerful platform for 3D whole heart simulations.

"Studying lineage decision-making in vitro: emerging concepts and novel tools.","Correct and timely lineage decisions are critical for normal embryonic development and homeostasis of adult tissues. Therefore, the search for fundamental principles that underlie lineage decision-making lies at the heart of developmental biology.

Fluctuations at the single-cell level are an important driving force behind cell-state transitions and the creation of cell-type diversity. Gene regulatory networks amplify such fluctuations and define stable cell types. They also mediate the influence of signaling inputs on the lineage decision. In this review, we focus on insights gleaned from in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells. We discuss emerging concepts, with an emphasis on transcriptional regulation, dynamical aspects of differentiation, and functional single-cell heterogeneity.

"Endometrial stem/progenitor cells: the first 10 years.","BACKGROUND: The existence of stem/progenitor cells in the endometrium was postulated many years ago, but the first functional evidence was only published in 2004. The identification of rare epithelial and stromal populations of clonogenic cells in human endometrium has opened an active area of research on endometrial stem/progenitor cells in the subsequent 10 years.METHODS: The published literature was searched using the PubMed database with the search terms 'endometrial stem cells and menstrual blood stem cells' until December 2014.RESULTS: Endometrial epithelial stem/progenitor cells have been identified as clonogenic cells in human and as label-retaining or CD44(+) cells in mouse endometrium, but their characterization has been modest. In contrast, endometrial mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been well characterized and show similar properties to bone marrow MSCs. Specific markers for their enrichment have been identified, CD146(+)PDGFR¦Â(+) (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta) and SUSD2(+) (sushi domain containing-2), which detected their perivascular location and likely pericyte identity in endometrial basalis and functionalis vessels. Transcriptomics and secretomics of SUSD2(+) cells confirm their perivascular phenotype. Stromal fibroblasts cultured from endometrial tissue or menstrual blood also have some MSC characteristics and demonstrate broad multilineage differentiation potential for mesodermal, endodermal and ectodermal lineages, indicating their plasticity. Side population (SP) cells are a mixed population, although predominantly vascular cells, which exhibit adult stem cell properties, including tissue reconstitution. There is some evidence that bone marrow cells contribute a small population of endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. The discovery of specific markers for endometrial stem/progenitor cells has enabled the examination of their role in endometrial proliferative disorders, including endometriosis, adenomyosis and Asherman's syndrome. Endometrial MSCs (eMSCs) and menstrual blood stromal fibroblasts are an attractive source of MSCs for regenerative medicine because of their relative ease of acquisition with minimal morbidity. Their homologous and non-homologous use as autologous and allogeneic cells for therapeutic purposes is currently being assessed in preclinical animal models of pelvic organ prolapse and phase I/II clinical trials for cardiac failure. eMSCs and stromal fibroblasts also exhibit non-stem cell-associated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, further emphasizing their desirable properties for cell-based therapies.CONCLUSIONS: Much has been learnt about endometrial stem/progenitor cells in the 10 years since their discovery, although several unresolved issues remain. These include rationalizing the terminology and diagnostic characteristics used for distinguishing perivascular stem/progenitor cells from stromal fibroblasts, which also have considerable differentiation potential. The hierarchical relationship between clonogenic epithelial progenitor cells, endometrial and decidual SP cells, CD146(+)PDGFR-¦Â(+) and SUSD2(+) cells and menstrual blood stromal fibroblasts still needs to be resolved. Developing more genetic animal models for investigating the role of endometrial stem/progenitor cells in endometrial disorders is required, as well as elucidating which bone marrow cells contribute to endometrial tissue. Deep sequencing and epigenetic profiling of enriched populations of endometrial stem/progenitor cells and their differentiated progeny at the population and single-cell level will shed new light on the regulation and function of endometrial stem/progenitor cells.","Human reproduction update","26552890",2015,"England"
"LFP-guided targeting of a cortical barrel column for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging.","Two-photon microscopy of bulk-loaded functional dyes is an outstanding physiological technique that enables simultaneous functional mapping of hundreds of brain cells in vivo at single-cell resolution. However, precise targeting of a specific cortical location is not easy due to its fine dimensionality. To enable precise targeting, intrinsic-signal optical imaging is often additionally performed. However, the intrinsic-signal optical imaging is not only time-consuming but also ineffective in ensuring precision. Here, we propose an alternative method for precise targeting based on local field potential (LFP) recording, a conventional electrophysiological method. The heart of this method lies in use of the same glass pipette to record LFPs and to eject calcium dye. After confirming the target area by LFP using a glass pipette, the calcium dye is ejected from the same pipette without a time delay or spatial adjustment. As a result, the calcium dye is loaded into the same ensemble of brain cells from which the LFP was obtained. As a validation of the proposed LFP-based method, we targeted and successfully loaded calcium dye into layer 2/3 of a mouse barrel column. ","Scientific reports","26511063",2015,"England"
"A loss-of-function and H2B-Venus transcriptional reporter allele for Gata6 in mice.","BACKGROUND: The GATA-binding factor 6 (Gata6) gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that often functions as a key regulator of lineage specification during development. It is the earliest known marker of the primitive endoderm lineage in the mammalian blastocyst. During gastrulation, GATA6 is expressed in early cardiac mesoderm and definitive endoderm progenitors, and is necessary for development of specific mesoderm and endoderm-derived organs including the heart, liver, and pancreas. Furthermore, reactivation or silencing of the Gata6 locus has been associated with certain types of cancer affecting endodermal organs.RESULTS: We have generated a Gata6(H2B-Venus) knock-in reporter mouse allele for the purpose of labeling GATA6-expressing cells with a bright nuclear-localized fluorescent marker that is suitable for live imaging at single-cell resolution.CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the Venus reporter was characterized starting from embryonic stem (ES) cells, through mouse embryos and adult animals. The Venus reporter was not expressed in ES cells, but was activated upon endoderm differentiation. Gata6(H2B-Venus/H2B-Venus) homozygous embryos did not express GATA6 protein and failed to specify the primitive endoderm in the blastocyst. However, null blastocysts continued to express high levels of Venus in the absence of GATA6 protein, suggesting that early Gata6 transcription is independent of GATA6 protein expression. At early post-implantation stages of embryonic development, there was a strong correlation of Venus with endogenous GATA6 protein in endoderm and mesoderm progenitors, then later in the heart, midgut, and hindgut. However, there were discrepancies in reporter versus endogenous protein expression in certain cells, such as the body wall and endocardium. During organogenesis, detection of Venus in specific organs recapitulated known sites of endogenous GATA6 expression, such as in the lung bud epithelium, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, stomach epithelium, and vascular endothelium. In adults, Venus was observed in the lungs, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, ovaries, uterus, bladder, skin, adrenal glands, small intestine and corpus region of the stomach. Overall, Venus fluorescent protein under regulatory control of the Gata6 locus was expressed at levels that were easily visualized directly and could endure live and time-lapse imaging techniques. Venus is co-expressed with endogenous GATA6 throughout development to adulthood, and should provide an invaluable tool for examining the status of the Gata6 locus during development, as well as its silencing or reactivation in cancer or other disease states.","BMC developmental biology","26498761",2015,"United States"
"Imaging the beating heart in the mouse using intravital microscopy techniques.","Real-time microscopic imaging of moving organs at single-cell resolution represents a major challenge in studying complex biology in living systems. Motion of the tissue from the cardiac and respiratory cycles severely limits intravital microscopy by compromising ultimate spatial and temporal imaging resolution. However, significant recent advances have enabled single-cell resolution imaging to be achieved in vivo. In this protocol, we describe experimental procedures for intravital microscopy based on a combination of thoracic surgery, tissue stabilizers and acquisition gating methods, which enable imaging at the single-cell level in the beating heart in the mouse. Setup of the model is typically completed in 1 h, which allows 2 h or more of continuous cardiac imaging. This protocol can be readily adapted for the imaging of other moving organs, and it will therefore broadly facilitate in vivo high-resolution microscopy studies.

Here, we aimed to identify factors that would promote an adequate level of function to permit robust single-cell contractility measurements in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). A simple screen revealed the collaborative effects of thyroid hormone, IGF-1 and the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone on the electrophysiology, bioenergetics, and contractile force generation of hPSC-CMs. In this optimized condition, hiPSC-CMs with mutations in MYBPC3, a gene encoding myosin-binding protein C, which, when mutated, causes HCM, showed significantly lower contractile force generation than controls. This was recapitulated by direct knockdown of MYBPC3 in control hPSC-CMs, supporting a mechanism of haploinsufficiency. Modeling this disease in vitro using human cells is an important step toward identifying therapeutic interventions for HCM.","Cell reports","26489474",2015,"International"
"Single-Cell Expression Profiling Reveals a Dynamic State of Cardiac Precursor Cells in the Early Mouse Embryo.","In the early vertebrate embryo, cardiac progenitor/precursor cells (CPs) give rise to cardiac structures. Better understanding their biological character is critical to understand the heart development and to apply CPs for the clinical arena. However, our knowledge remains incomplete. With the use of single-cell expression profiling, we have now revealed rapid and dynamic changes in gene expression profiles of the embryonic CPs during the early phase after their segregation from the cardiac mesoderm. Progressively, the nascent mesodermal gene Mesp1 terminated, and Nkx2-5+/Tbx5+ population rapidly replaced the Tbx5low+ population as the expression of the cardiac genes Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 increased. At the Early Headfold stage, Tbx5-expressing CPs gradually showed a unique molecular signature with signs of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Lineage-tracing revealed a developmentally distinct characteristic of this population. They underwent progressive differentiation only towards the cardiomyocyte lineage corresponding to the first heart field rather than being maintained as a progenitor pool. More importantly, Tbx5 likely plays an important role in a transcriptional network to regulate the distinct character of the FHF via a positive feedback loop to activate the robust expression of Tbx5 in CPs. These data expands our knowledge on the behavior of CPs during the early phase of cardiac development, subsequently providing a platform for further study.

"Turbulent states and their transitions in mathematical models for ventricular tissue: the effects of random interstitial fibroblasts.","We study the dynamical behaviors of two types of spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence states, respectively, in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) mathematical models, of human, ventricular, myocyte cells that are attached to randomly distributed interstitial fibroblasts; these turbulence states are promoted by (a) the steep slope of the action-potential-duration-restitution (APDR) plot or (b) early afterdepolarizations (EADs). Our single-cell study shows that (1) the myocyte-fibroblast (MF) coupling G_{j} and (2) the number N_{f} of fibroblasts in an MF unit lower the steepness of the APDR slope and eliminate the EAD behaviors of myocytes; we explore the pacing dependence of such EAD suppression. In our 2D simulations, we observe that a spiral-turbulence (ST) state evolves into a state with a single, rotating spiral (RS) if either (a) G_{j} is large or (b) the maximum possible number of fibroblasts per myocyte N_{f}^{max} is large. We also observe that the minimum value of G_{j}, for the transition from the ST to the RS state, decreases as N_{f}^{max} increases. We find that, for the steep-APDR-induced ST state, once the MF coupling suppresses ST, the rotation period of a spiral in the RS state increases as (1) G_{j} increases, with fixed N_{f}^{max}, and (2) N_{f}^{max} increases, with fixed G_{j}. We obtain the boundary between ST and RS stability regions in the N_{f}^{max}-G_{j} plane. In particular, for low values of N_{f}^{max}, the value of G_{j}, at the ST-RS boundary, depends on the realization of the randomly distributed fibroblasts; this dependence decreases as N_{f}^{max} increases. Our 3D studies show a similar transition from scroll-wave turbulence to a single, rotating, scroll-wave state because of the MF coupling. We examine the experimental implications of our study and propose that the suppression (a) of the steep slope of the APDR or (b) EADs can eliminate spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence in heterogeneous cardiac tissue, which has randomly distributed fibroblasts.

"Time Course of Cell Sheet Adhesion to Porcine Heart Tissue after Transplantation.","Multilayered cell sheets have been produced from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for investigating their adhesion properties onto native porcine heart tissue. Once MSCs reached confluence after a 7-day culture on a temperature-responsive culture dish, a MSCs monolayer spontaneously detached itself from the dish, when the culture temperature was reduced from 37 to 20¡ãC. The basal extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins of the single cell sheet are preserved, because this technique requires no proteolytic enzymes for harvesting cell sheet, which become a basic building block for assembling a multilayer cell sheet. The thickness of multilayered cell sheets made from three MSC sheets was found to be approximately 60 ¦Ìm. For investigating the adhesion properties of the basal and apical sides, the multilayered cell sheets were transplanted onto the surface of the heart's left ventricle. Multilayered cell sheets were histological investigated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after transplantation by hematoxylin eosin (HE) and azan dyes to determine required time for the adhesion of the multilayered sheets following cell-sheet transplantation. The results showed that only the basal side of multilayered cell sheets significantly enhanced the sheets adhesion onto the surface of heart 30 minutes after transplantation. This study concluded that (1) cell sheets had to be transplanted with its basal side onto the surface of heart tissue and (2) at least 30 minutes were necessary for obtaining the histological adhesion of the sheets to the heart tissue. This study provided clinical evidence and parameters for the successful application of MSC sheets to the myocardium and allowed cell sheet technology to be adapted clinical cell-therapy for myocardial diseases.

"Contractility Measurements on Isolated Papillary Muscles for the Investigation of Cardiac Inotropy in Mice.","Papillary muscle isolated from adult mouse hearts can be used to study cardiac contractility during different physiological/pathological conditions. The contractile characteristics can be evaluated independently of external influences such as vascular tonus or neurohumoral status. It depicts a scientific approach between single cell measurements with isolated cardiac myocytes and in vivo studies like echocardiography. Thus, papillary muscle preparations serve as an excellent model to study cardiac physiology/pathophysiology and can be used for investigations like the modulation by pharmacological agents or the exploration of transgenic animal models. Here, we describe a method of isolating the murine left anterior papillary muscle to investigate cardiac contractility in an organ bath setup. In contrast to a muscle strip preparation isolated from the ventricular wall, the papillary muscle can be prepared in toto without damaging the muscle tissue severely. The organ bath setup consists of several temperature-controlled, gassed and electrode-equipped organ bath chambers. The isolated papillary muscle is fixed in the organ bath chamber and electrically stimulated. The evoked twitch force is recorded using a pressure transducer and parameters such as twitch force amplitude and twitch kinetics are analyzed. Different experimental protocols can be performed to investigate the calcium- and frequency-dependent contractility as well as dose-response curves of contractile agents such as catecholamines or other pharmaceuticals. Additionally, pathologic conditions like acute ischemia can be simulated. ","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","26436250",2015,"United States"
"Matrigel Mattress: A Method for the Generation of Single Contracting Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.","RATIONALE: The lack of measurable single-cell contractility of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) currently limits the utility of hiPSC-CMs for evaluating contractile performance for both basic research and drug discovery.OBJECTIVE: To develop a culture method that rapidly generates contracting single hiPSC-CMs and allows quantification of cell shortening with standard equipment used for studying adult CMs.METHODS AND RESULTS: Single hiPSC-CMs were cultured for 5 to 7 days on a 0.4- to 0.8-mm thick mattress of undiluted Matrigel (mattress hiPSC-CMs) and compared with hiPSC-CMs maintained on a control substrate (&lt;0.1-mm thick 1:60 diluted Matrigel, control hiPSC-CMs). Compared with control hiPSC-CMs, mattress hiPSC-CMs had more rod-shape morphology and significantly increased sarcomere length. Contractile parameters of mattress hiPSC-CMs measured with video-based edge detection were comparable with those of freshly isolated adult rabbit ventricular CMs. Morphological and contractile properties of mattress hiPSC-CMs were consistent across cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs generated independently at another institution. Unlike control hiPSC-CMs, mattress hiPSC-CMs display robust contractile responses to positive inotropic agents, such as myofilament calcium sensitizers. Mattress hiPSC-CMs exhibit molecular changes that include increased expression of the maturation marker cardiac troponin I and significantly increased action potential upstroke velocity because of a 2-fold increase in sodium current (INa).CONCLUSIONS: The Matrigel mattress method enables the rapid generation of robustly contracting hiPSC-CMs and enhances maturation. This new method allows quantification of contractile performance at the single-cell level, which should be valuable to disease modeling, drug discovery, and preclinical cardiotoxicity testing.","Circulation research","26429802",2015,"United States"
"Contractility of single cardiomyocytes differentiated from pluripotent stem cells depends on physiological shape and substrate stiffness.","Single cardiomyocytes contain myofibrils that harbor the sarcomere-based contractile machinery of the myocardium. Cardiomyocytes differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) have potential as an in vitro model of heart activity. However, their fetal-like misalignment of myofibrils limits their usefulness for modeling contractile activity. We analyzed the effects of cell shape and substrate stiffness on the shortening and movement of labeled sarcomeres and the translation of sarcomere activity to mechanical output (contractility) in live engineered hPSC-CMs. Single hPSC-CMs were cultured on polyacrylamide substrates of physiological stiffness (10 kPa), and Matrigel micropatterns were used to generate physiological shapes (2,000-¦Ìm(2) rectangles with length:width aspect ratios of 5:1-7:1) and a mature alignment of myofibrils. Translation of sarcomere shortening to mechanical output was highest in 7:1 hPSC-CMs. Increased substrate stiffness and applied overstretch induced myofibril defects in 7:1 hPSC-CMs and decreased mechanical output. Inhibitors of nonmuscle myosin activity repressed the assembly of myofibrils, showing that subcellular tension drives the improved contractile activity in these engineered hPSC-CMs. Other factors associated with improved contractility were axially directed calcium flow, systematic mitochondrial distribution, more mature electrophysiology, and evidence of transverse-tubule formation. These findings support the potential of these engineered hPSC-CMs as powerful models for studying myocardial contractility at the cellular level.

"Monitoring Changes in the Redox State of Myoglobin in Cardiomyocytes by Raman Spectroscopy Enables the Protective Effect of NO Donors to Be Evaluated.","Raman microspectroscopy has been used to monitor changes in the redox and ligand-coordination states of the heme complex in myoglobin during the preconditioning of ex vivo cardiomyocytes with pharmacological drugs that release nitric oxide (NO). These chemical agents are known to confer protection on heart tissue against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Subsequent changes in the redox and ligand-coordination states during experimental simulations of ischemia and reperfusion have also been monitored. We found that these measurements, in real time, could be used to evaluate the preconditioning treatment of cardiomyocytes and to predict the likelihood of cell survival following a potentially lethal period of ischemia. Evaluation of the preconditioning treatment was done at the single-cell level. The binding of NO to myoglobin, giving a 6-coordinate ferrous-heme complex, was inferred from the measured Raman bands of a cardiomyocyte by comparison to pure solution of the protein in the presence of NO. A key change in the Raman spectrum was observed after perfusion of the NO-donor was completed, where, if the preconditioning treatment was successful, the bands corresponding to the nitrosyl complex were replaced by bands corresponding to metmyoglobin, Mb(III). An observation of Mb(III) bands in the Raman spectrum was made for all of the cardiomyocytes that recovered contractile function, whereas the absence of Mb(III) bands always indicated that the cardiomyocyte would be unable to recover contractile function following the simulated conditions of ischemia and reperfusion in these experiments.

"The Unc-5 Receptor Is Directly Regulated by Tinman in the Developing Drosophila Dorsal Vessel.","During early heart morphogenesis cardiac cells migrate in two bilateral opposing rows, meet at the dorsal midline and fuse to form a hollow tube known as the primary heart field in vertebrates or dorsal vessel (DV) in Drosophila. Guidance receptors are thought to mediate this evolutionarily conserved process. A core of transcription factors from the NK2, GATA and T-box families are also believed to orchestrate this process in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Nevertheless, whether they accomplish their function, at least in part, through direct or indirect transcriptional regulation of guidance receptors is currently unknown. In our work, we demonstrate how Tinman (Tin), the Drosophila homolog of the Nkx-2.5 transcription factor, regulates the Unc-5 receptor during DV tube morphogenesis. We use genetics, expression analysis with single cell mRNA resolution and enhancer-reporter assays in vitro or in vivo to demonstrate that Tin is required for Unc-5 receptor expression specifically in cardioblasts. We show that Tin can bind to evolutionary conserved sites within an Unc-5 DV enhancer and that these sites are required for Tin-dependent transactivation both in vitro and in vivo.

"A new standardized clinical-grade protocol for banking human umbilical cord tissue cells.","BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from human umbilical cord tissue (UCT) can be considered the perfect candidates for cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine. UCT-derived MSCs can be cryogenically stored in cell banks and expanded as needed for therapeutic uses.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a new method for UCT-MSC isolation, cryopreservation, and expansion, following all criteria required by a stem cell bank. UCT-MSCs were isolated either by manual dissociation (MM) or by a semiautomatic dissociation system (SAM). In both protocols UCTs were treated enzymatically using Type IV collagenase good manufacturing practices (GMP) graded and hyaluronidase (medicinal product). Isolated UCT-MSCs were cryopreserved and analyzed after thawing for phenotype; for proliferation rate; and for their osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation capabilities.RESULTS: We found that SAM reduced the time of tissue enzyme exposure and enabled us to obtain a homogeneous single-cell suspension deprived of tissue fragments. The isolated cells in both groups showed high expression of MSC markers CD105, CD73, and CD90 and similar differentiation capabilities, phenotype, and proliferation potential. Moreover, the final yield of MSCs was comparable between the two techniques.CONCLUSION: In this study, we have established a reliable and standardized protocol to isolate UCT-MSCs from UCT for cell banking purposes. Processing the whole umbilical tissue with GMP-graded enzymes using a semiautomatic dissociator allowed us to obtain a single-cell suspension product with a known number of isolated cells that can be cryopreserved right after isolation and thawed as needed for expansion and clinical use.","Transfusion","26354088",2015,"United States"
"Single-Cell RNA-Seq of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reveals Unique Profiles of Lineage Priming.","The plasticity and immunomodulatory capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have spurred clinical use in recent years. However, clinical outcomes vary and many ascribe inconsistency to the tissue source of MSCs. Yet unconsidered is the extent of heterogeneity of individual MSCs from a given tissue source with respect to differentiation potential and immune regulatory function. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional diversity of murine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. We found genes associated with MSC multipotency were expressed at a high level and with consistency between individual cells. However, genes associated with osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, neurogenic and vascular smooth muscle differentiation were expressed at widely varying levels between individual cells. Further, certain genes associated with immunomodulation were also inconsistent between individual cells. Differences could not be ascribed to cycles of proliferation, culture bias or other cellular process, which might alter transcript expression in a regular or cyclic pattern. These results support and extend the concept of lineage priming of MSCs and emphasize caution for in vivo or clinical use of MSCs, even when immunomodulation is the goal, since multiple mesodermal (and even perhaps ectodermal) outcomes are a possibility. Purification might enable shifting of the probability of a certain outcome, but is unlikely to remove multilineage potential altogether. ","PloS one","26352588",2015,"United States"
"Micropost arrays for measuring stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte contractility.","Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have the potential to be used to study heart disease and maturation, screen drug treatments, and restore heart function. Here, we discuss the procedures involved in using micropost arrays to measure the contractile forces generated by stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte contractility is needed for the heart to pump blood, so measuring the contractile forces of cardiomyocytes is a straightforward way to assess their function. Microfabrication and soft lithography techniques are utilized to create identical arrays of flexible, silicone microposts from a common master. Micropost arrays are functionalized with extracellular matrix protein to allow cardiomyocytes to adhere to the tips of the microposts. Live imaging is used to capture videos of the deflection of microposts caused by the contraction of the cardiomyocytes. Image analysis code provides an accurate means to quantify these deflections. The contractile forces produced by a beating cardiomyocyte are calculated by modeling the microposts as cantilever beams. We have used this assay to assess techniques for improving the maturation and contractile function of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. ","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)","26344757",2015,"United States"
"Computer simulations to investigate the causes of T-wave notching.","Drugs that cause strong hERG potassium channel block (e.g., dofetilide, quinidine) cause T-wave notching. It has been suggested that this is due to prolongation of mid-myocardial (M) cells' action potential duration relative to endocardial and epicardial cells. However, the role of M cells in intact human hearts is debated. We simulated 2025 electrocardiograms representing changes in ventricular action potentials using the equivalent double layer mode that does not include M-cells. Action potential changes included prolongation, triangularization, squaring, and bumps in late repolarization, which have been observed experimentally and in single cell models with block of the hERG potassium channel. Changes were applied globally and spatially dispersed. Action potential bumps (slowing in late repolarization) produced T-wave notching similar to that observed clinically in healthy subjects receiving dofetilide or quinidine. Conversely, all other action potential changes (i.e., prolongation, triangularization, squaring), either global or spatially dispersed, resulted in T-wave changes, but did not cause T-wave notching. This study demonstrates that M-cells are not required to simulate T-wave notching.","Journal of electrocardiology","26341648",2015,"United States"
"Balancing functions of annexin A6 maintain equilibrium between hypertrophy and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.","Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor associated with heart failure, a state concomitant with increased cell death. However, the mechanism governing progression of hypertrophy to apoptosis at the single-cell level remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate annexin A6 (Anxa6), a calcium (Ca(2+))-dependent phospholipid-binding protein critically regulates the transition of chronic hypertrophied cardiomyocytes to apoptosis. Treatment of the H9c2(2-1) cardiomyocytes with hypertrophic agonists upregulates and relocalizes Anxa6 with increased cytosolic punctate appearance. Live cell imaging revealed that chronic exposure to hypertrophic agonists such as phenylephrine (PE) compromises the mitochondrial membrane potential (¦¤¦·m) and morphological dynamics. Such chronic hypertrophic induction also activated the caspases 9 and 3 and induced cleavage of the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1), which are the typical downstream events in the mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. An increased rate of apoptosis was evident in the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes after 48-72 h of treatment with the hypertrophic agonists. Anxa6 was progressively associated with the mitochondrial fraction under chronic hypertrophic stimulation, and Anxa6 knockdown severely abrogated mitochondrial network and dynamics. Ectopically expressed Anxa6 protected the mitochondrial morphology and dynamics under PE treatment, and also increased the cellular susceptibility to apoptosis. Biochemical analysis showed that Anxa6 interacts with Parp1 and its 89 kDa cleaved product in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner through the N-terminal residues (1-28). Furthermore, expression of Anxa6(S13E), a mutant dominant negative with respect to Parp1 binding, served as an enhancer of mitochondrial dynamics, even under chronic PE treatment. Chemical inhibition of Parp1 activity released the cellular vulnerability to apoptosis in Anxa6-expressing stable cell lines, thereby shifting the equilibrium away from cell death. Taken together, the present study depicts a dual regulatory function of Anxa6 that is crucial for balancing hypertrophy with apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.","Cell death &amp; disease","26335715",2015,"England"
"Integrin Based Isolation Enables Purification of Murine Lineage Committed Cardiomyocytes.","In contrast to mature cardiomyocytes which have limited regenerative capacity, pluripotent stem cells represent a promising source for the generation of new cardiomyocytes. The tendency of pluripotent stem cells to form teratomas and the heterogeneity from various differentiation stages and cardiomyocyte cell sub-types, however, are major obstacles to overcome before this type of therapy could be applied in a clinical setting. Thus, the identification of extracellular markers for specific cardiomyocyte progenitors and mature subpopulations is of particular importance. The delineation of cardiomyocyte surface marker patterns not only serves as a means to derive homogeneous cell populations by FACS, but is also an essential tool to understand cardiac development. By using single-cell expression profiling in early mouse embryonic hearts, we found that a combination of integrin alpha-1, alpha-5, alpha-6 and N-cadherin enables isolation of lineage committed murine cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we were able to separate trabecular cardiomyocytes from solid ventricular myocardium and atrial murine cells. These cells exhibit expected subtype specific phenotype confirmed by electrophysiological analysis. We show that integrin expression can be used for the isolation of living, functional and lineage-specific murine cardiomyocytes. ","PloS one","26323090",2015,"United States"
"Evaluation of the role of miR-31-dependent reduction in dystrophin and nNOS on atrial-fibrillation-induced electrical remodelling in man.","BACKGROUND: The management of atrial fibrillation remains a challenge. This condition remodels atrial electrical properties, which promote resistance to treatment. Although remodelling has long been a therapeutic target in atrial fibrillation, its causes remain incompletely understood. We aimed to evaluate the role of miR-31-dependent reduction in dystrophin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, also known as NOS1) on atrial electrical properties and atrial fibrillation inducibility.METHODS: We recruited 258 patients (209 patients in sinus rhythm and 49 with permanent atrial fibrillation) from the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; written informed consent was obtained from each participant. We also used a goat model of pacing-induced atrial fibrillation (24 with atrial fibrillation vs 20 controls in normal sinus rythm) and nNos-knock-out mice (n=28 compared with 27 wild-type littermates). Gene expression of miR-31, dystrophin, and nNOS was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR; protein content was measured by immunoblotting; NOS activity was evaluated with high-performance liquid chromatography; action potential duration (APD) and rate dependent adaptation were assessed by single-cell patch-clamping, and atrial fibrillation inducibility was evaluated by transoesophageal atrial burst stimulation.FINDINGS: We found that atrial-specific upregulation of miR-31 in human atrial fibrillation caused dystrophin (DYS) translational repression and accelerated mRNA degradation of nNOS leading to a profound reduction in atrial DYS and nNOS protein content and in nitric oxide availability. In human atrial myocytes obtained from patients in sinus rhythm, nNOS inhibition was sufficient to recapitulate hallmark features of remodelling induced by atrial fibrillation, such as shortening of APD and loss of APD rate-dependency, but had no effect in patients with atrial fibrillation. In mice, nNos gene deletion or inhibition shortened atrial APD and increased atrial fibrillation inducibility in vivo. Inhibition of miR-31 in human atrial fibrillation recovered DYS and nNOS, and normalised APD and APD rate-dependency. Prevention of miR-31 binding to nNOS 3'UTR recovered both nNOS protein and gene expression but had no effect on the DYS protein or mRNA level (consistent with the mRNA degradation of nNOS by miR-31). Prevention of miR-31 binding to DYS 3'UTR increased DYS protein but not mRNA is consistent with translation repression of DYS by miR-31; recovery of DYS protein increased nNOS protein but not mRNA in keeping with a stabilising effect of DYS on nNOS protein. In goats, a reduction in dystrophin and nNOS protein content was associated with upregulation of miR-31 in the atria but not in the ventricles.INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that atrial-specific upregulation of miR-31 in human atrial fibrillation is a key mechanism causing atrial loss of dystrophin and nNOS; this loss leads to the electrical phenotype induced by atrial fibrillation.FUNDING: British Heart Foundation (BHF) Programme grant (for BC and XL), BHF Centre of Excellence in Oxford (SR), Leducq Foundation (in part for BC and SR), the European Union's seventh Framework Programme Grant Agree.","Lancet (London, England)","26312904",2015,"United Kingdom"

"Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis of Transplanted Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes After Acute Myocardial Infarction.","BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are attractive candidates for therapeutic use, with the potential to replace deficient cells and to improve functional recovery in injury or disease settings. Here, we test the hypothesis that human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) can secrete cytokines as a molecular basis to attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Human iPSCs were generated from skin fibroblasts and differentiated in vitro with a small molecule-based protocol. Troponin(+) iPSC-CMs were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and electrophysiological measurements. Afterward, 2¡Á10(6) iPSC-CMs derived from a cell line transduced with a vector expressing firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein were transplanted into adult NOD/SCID mice with acute left anterior descending artery ligation. Control animals received PBS injection. Bioluminescence imaging showed limited engraftment on transplantation into ischemic myocardium. However, magnetic resonance imaging of animals transplanted with iPSC-CMs showed significant functional improvement and attenuated cardiac remodeling compared with PBS-treated control animals. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, microfluidic single-cell profiling of harvested iPSC-CMs, laser capture microdissection of host myocardium, and in vitro ischemia stimulation were used to demonstrate that the iPSC-CMs could release significant levels of proangiogenic and antiapoptotic factors in the ischemic microenvironment.CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of human iPSC-CMs into an acute mouse myocardial infarction model can improve left ventricular function and attenuate cardiac remodeling. Because of limited engraftment, most of the effects are possibly explained by paracrine activity of these cells.","Circulation","26304668",2015,"United States"
"Cellular and Nuclear Alignment Analysis for Determining Epithelial Cell Chirality.","Left-right (LR) asymmetry is a biologically conserved property in living organisms that can be observed in the asymmetrical arrangement of organs and tissues and in tissue morphogenesis, such as the directional looping of the gastrointestinal tract and heart. The expression of LR asymmetry in embryonic tissues can be appreciated in biased cell alignment. Previously an in vitro chirality assay was reported by patterning multiple cells on microscale defined geometries and quantified the cell phenotype-dependent LR asymmetry, or cell chirality. However, morphology and chirality of individual cells on micropatterned surfaces has not been well characterized. Here, a Python-based algorithm was developed to identify and quantify immunofluorescence stained individual epithelial cells on multicellular patterns. This approach not only produces results similar to the image intensity gradient-based method reported previously, but also can capture properties of single cells such as area and aspect ratio. We also found that cell nuclei exhibited biased alignment. Around 35% cells were misaligned and were typically smaller and less elongated. This new imaging analysis approach is an effective tool for measuring single cell chirality inside multicellular structures and can potentially help unveil biophysical mechanisms underlying cellular chiral bias both in vitro and in vivo.

"UCP2 Modulates Cardioprotective Effects of Ru360 in Isolated Cardiomyocytes during Ischemia.","INTRODUCTION: Ruthenium 360 (Ru360) has been shown to induce cardioprotective mechanisms in perfused hearts. The agent is a specific blocker of the main cardiac mitochondrial uptake mechanism, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). UCP2, a mitochondrial membrane protein, which influences cardiac ROS formation was reported to interact with the MCU.METHODS: To prove whether Ru360 affects ischemic cell injury on the singular cell level, cell viability (CV) in isolated cardiomyocytes from wild type mice (WT) was measured in a model of pelleting hypoxia (PH). To explore a possible influence of UCP2 on cellular survival, as well as on Ru360 function, cardiomyocytes from UCP2-/- mice were investigated.RESULTS: During PH, Ru360 significantly improved CV in WT cardiomyocytes (Control 26.32% ¡À 1.58% vs. PH 13.60% ¡À 1.20% vs. PH+Ru360 19.98% ¡À 0.98%, n = 6; p &lt; 0.05). No differences in the rate of apoptosis were observed in UCP2-/- vs. WT. In UCP2-/- cardiomyocytes, Ru360 reduced the rate of cell death. However, the effect was less pronounced compared to WT cardiomyocytes.CONCLUSION: Ru360 significantly reduces hypoxic cell injury by preventing single cell apoptosis in WT cardiomyoctes. UCP2 does not affect cell survival in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, but it might modulate cardioprotective effects of Ru360 during ischemia.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)","26248074",2015,"Switzerland"

"Centrifugal microfluidic platform for single-cell level cardiomyocyte-based drug profiling and screening.","Drug screening and profiling is an important phase in drug discovery, development, and marketing. However, some profiling tests are not routinely done because of the needed additional technical skills and costly maintenance, which leads to cases of unexpected side effects or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study presents the design and operation of a microfluidic chip for single-cell level drug screening and profiling as an alternative platform for this purpose. Centrifugation was utilized to trap isolated single and groups of primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in the same chip. In the off-spin operation of the chip, the cells can be observed under a microscope and movies of the beat motion can be recorded. The beat profiles of the cells were generated by image correlation analysis of the recorded video to study the contractile characteristics (beating rate, beating strength, and inter-beat duration). By utilizing this non-invasive tool, long term continuous monitoring, right after trapping, was made possible and cell growth and dynamics were successfully observed in the chip. Media and liquid replacement does not require further centrifugation but instead utilizes capillary flow only. The effect of carbachol (100 ¦ÌM) and isoproterenol (4 ¦Ìg mL(-1)) on single cells and groups of cells was demonstrated and the feature for immunostaining (¦Â-actin) applicability of the chip was revealed.

Priming of MSCs with growth factors has been reported to improve their therapeutic efficacy through gap junction-mediated mechanisms. However, the expression pattern of Connexin43 (Cx43) in growth factor-stimulated MSC was not previously addressed. In this study we investigated how the pre-treatment with growth factors modulates MSC ability to integrate into the host tissue after transplantation, with particular focus on the expression of Cx43 and its cellular distribution. Our results showed that stimulation of MSCs with IGF-1, FGF-2, but not TGF¦Â, increased the level of Cx43 at both mRNA and protein levels. IGF-1 stimulation resulted in a shift of the fibroblast morphology into an epithelial morphology in several well-defined areas of stimulated cells. Confocal microscopy examination revealed that the increase of Cx43 was restricted to the epithelial-like cells and did not occur in other cells. In variance, FGF-2 induced a rod-shape morphology of every single cell, which achieved an extremely low cell index. FGF-2 stimulation also induced a time-dependent increase in Cx43, with a regular distribution pattern in all cells. Dye transfer assay coupled with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated functional in vitro cell coupling between FGF-2-stimulated MSCs as well as between FGF-2-stimulated cells and H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, a scenery that mimick MSC transplantation into the myocardium. We conclude that the stimulation of MSCs with FGF-2 prior to transplantation may facilitate their access among the myocardial cells and increase the functional coupling between transplanted and host cells.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","26187662",2015,"United States"

"Mitochondrial DNA mutations in single human blood cells.","Determination mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from extremely small amounts of DNA extracted from tissue of limited amounts and/or degraded samples is frequently employed in medical, forensic, and anthropologic studies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by DNA cloning is a routine method, especially to examine heteroplasmy of mtDNA mutations. In this review, we compare the mtDNA mutation patterns detected by three different sequencing strategies. Cloning and sequencing methods that are based on PCR amplification of DNA extracted from either single cells or pooled cells yield a high frequency of mutations, partly due to the artifacts introduced by PCR and/or the DNA cloning process. Direct sequencing of PCR product which has been amplified from DNA in individual cells is able to detect the low levels of mtDNA mutations present within a cell. We further summarize the findings in our recent studies that utilized this single cell method to assay mtDNA mutation patterns in different human blood cells. Our data show that many somatic mutations observed in the end-stage differentiated cells are found in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors within the CD34(+) cell compartment. Accumulation of mtDNA variations in the individual CD34+ cells is affected by both aging and family genetic background. Granulocytes harbor higher numbers of mutations compared with the other cells, such as CD34(+) cells and lymphocytes. Serial assessment of mtDNA mutations in a population of single CD34(+) cells obtained from the same donor over time suggests stability of some somatic mutations. CD34(+) cell clones from a donor marked by specific mtDNA somatic mutations can be found in the recipient after transplantation. The significance of these findings is discussed in terms of the lineage tracing of HSCs, aging effect on accumulation of mtDNA mutations and the usage of mtDNA sequence in forensic identification.

"Sex- and afferent-specific differences in histamine receptor expression in vagal afferents of rats: A potential mechanism for sexual dimorphism in prevalence and severity of asthma.","The incidence of asthma is more common in boys than in girls during the childhood, and more common in premenopausal female than age-matched males. Our previous study demonstrated a gender difference in histamine-mediated neuroexcitability in nodose ganglia neurons (NGNs), highlighting a possibility of histamine-mediated gender difference in asthma via visceral afferent function. In the present study, we aimed to explore the gender difference in expression profiles of histamine receptors (HRs) in nodose ganglia (NG) and individual identified NGNs to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms involved in sexual dimorphism of asthma. Western-blot and SYBR green RT-PCR showed that H2R and H3R were highly expressed in NG of females compared with males and downregulated in ovariectomized females. H1R was equally expressed in NG of both sexes and not altered by ovariectomy. Furthermore, this highly expressive H2R and H3R were distributed in both myelinated and unmyelinated NGNs isolated from adult female rats by immunofluorescence and single-cell RT-PCR. H3R widely distributed in all tested neuron subtypes and its expression did not show significant difference among neuron subtypes. H2R was widely and highly expressed in low-threshold and sex-specific subpopulation of myelinated Ah-types compared with myelinated A- and unmyelinated C-type NGNs. Unexpectedly, weak expression of H1R was detected in both myelinated and unmyelinated NGNs by immunofluorescence, which was further confirmed by single-cell RT-PCR. Our results suggest that the sexual dimorphism in the expression of H2R and H3R in vagal afferents very likely contributes, at least partially, to the gender difference in prevalence and severity of asthma.

"Effect of fiber diameter on the assembly of functional 3D cardiac patches.","The cardiac ECM has a unique 3D structure responsible for tissue morphogenesis and strong contractions. It is divided into three fiber groups with specific roles and distinct dimensions; nanoscale endomysial fibers, perimysial fibers with a diameter of 1 ¦Ìm, and epimysial fibers, which have a diameter of several micrometers. We report here on our work, where distinct 3D fibrous scaffolds, each of them recapitulating the dimension scales of a single fiber population in the heart matrix, were fabricated. We have assessed the mechanical properties of these scaffolds and the contribution of each fiber population to cardiomyocyte morphogenesis, tissue assembly and function. Our results show that the nanoscale fiber scaffolds were more elastic than the microscale scaffolds, however, cardiomyocytes cultured on microscale fiber scaffolds exhibited enhanced spreading and elongation, both on the single cell and on the engineered tissue levels. In addition, lower fibroblast proliferation rates were observed on these microscale topographies. Based on the collected data we have fabricated composite scaffolds containing micro and nanoscale fibers, promoting superior tissue morphogenesis without compromising tissue contraction. Cardiac tissues, engineered within these composite scaffolds exhibited superior function, including lower excitation threshold and stronger contraction forces than tissue engineered within the single-population fiber scaffolds.

"Protocols for Obtaining Zygotic and Somatic Embryos for Studying the Regulation of Early Embryo Development in the Model Legume Medicago truncatula.","Early embryogenesis starting from a single cell zygote goes through rapid cell division and morphogenesis, and is morphologically characterized by pre-globular, globular, heart, torpedo and cotyledon stages. This progressive development is under the tight regulation of a complex molecular network. Harvesting sufficient early embryos at a similar stage of development is essential for investigating the cellular and molecular regulation of early embryogenesis. This is not straightforward since early embryogenesis undergoes rapid morphogenesis in a short while e.g. 8 days for Medicago truncatula to reach the early cotyledon stage. Here, we address the issue by two approaches. The first one establishes a linkage between embryo development and pod morphology in helping indicate the stage of the zygotic embryo. This is particularly based on the number of pod spirals and development of the spines. An alternative way to complement the in vivo studies is via culturing leaf explants to produce somatic embryos. The medium includes an unusual hormone combination - an auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid), a cytokinin (6-benzylaminopurine), abscisic acid and gibberellic acid. The different stages can be discerned growing out of the callus without dissection. ","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","26131626",2015,"United States"
"The human cardiac and skeletal muscle proteomes defined by transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling.","BACKGROUND: To understand cardiac and skeletal muscle function, it is important to define and explore their molecular constituents and also to identify similarities and differences in the gene expression in these two different striated muscle tissues. Here, we have investigated the genes and proteins with elevated expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle in relation to all other major human tissues and organs using a global transcriptomics analysis complemented with antibody-based profiling to localize the corresponding proteins on a single cell level.RESULTS: Our study identified a comprehensive list of genes expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The genes with elevated expression were further stratified according to their global expression pattern across the human body as well as their precise localization in the muscle tissues. The functions of the proteins encoded by the elevated genes are well in line with the physiological functions of cardiac and skeletal muscle, such as contraction, ion transport, regulation of membrane potential and actomyosin structure organization. A large fraction of the transcripts in both cardiac and skeletal muscle correspond to mitochondrial proteins involved in energy metabolism, which demonstrates the extreme specialization of these muscle tissues to provide energy for contraction.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a comprehensive list of genes and proteins elevated in striated muscles. A number of proteins not previously characterized in cardiac and skeletal muscle were identified and localized to specific cellular subcompartments. These proteins represent an interesting starting point for further functional analysis of their role in muscle biology and disease.","BMC genomics","26109061",2015,"United States"
"Paracrine action of mesenchymal stem cells revealed by single cell gene profiling in infarcted murine hearts.","BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been recently demonstrated as a promising stem cell type to rescue damaged myocardium after acute infarction. One of the most important mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects is the secretion of paracrine factors. However, the expression profile of paracrine factors of MSCs in infarcted hearts, especially at single cell level, is poorly defined.METHODS AND RESULTS: We aimed to depict the transcriptional profile of paracrine factors secreted by MSCs in vivo, with particular interest in the comparison between normal and infarcted hearts. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and injected into mice hearts immediately after infarction surgery. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) indicated a proportion of cells still alive even up to 10 days post surgery. Paralleled with survived cells, cardiac function was significantly improved after MSC injection compared to that in PBS-injected mice, indicated by MRI and histology. Despite increased number of vessels in MSC-injected hearts, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes transdifferentiation were not observed in infarcted hearts 5 days after infarction. Furthermore, laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by high through-put real time PCR was employed in our study, uncovering that the injected MSCs, compared to local cardiomyocytes, displayed elevated levels of secreted factors. To further investigate the regulation of those factors, we performed single cell analysis to dissect the gene expression profile of MSCs at single cell level in infarcted and normal hearts, respectively. Consistent with the in vivo observation, a similar regulation pattern of those factors was detected in cultured MSCs under hypoxia.CONCLUSIONS: Our study, for the first time, elucidated gene expression profiles, as well as regulation of paracrine factors, of MSCs at single cell level in vivo, indicating that paracrine factors from MSCs account for the improvement of cardiac function after infarction.","PloS one","26043119",2015,"United States"
"Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism by Crassostrea gigas oyster extract inhibits noradrenaline-induced vascular contraction in Wistar rats.","OBJECTIVE: Crassostrea gigas oyster extract has been reported to have antioxidant, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering properties that may be useful for treating cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of C. gigas oyster extract on cardiovascular function in tissues from healthy rats.METHODS: Single-cell microelectrode and isolated thoracic aortic organ bath studies were performed on tissues from 8-week-old healthy Wistar rats, using varying concentrations of C. gigas oyster extract. To elucidate a mechanism of action for the oyster's vasoactive properties, concentration response curves were carried out in the presence of a calcium channel inhibitior (verapamil), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester), a potassium channel inhibitor (4-aminopyridine), in addition to the ¦Á-adrenoceptor inhibitor prazosin.RESULTS: Oyster solution at 7 500 mg/mL inhibited noradrenaline-induced contraction in isolated aortic rings. Cardiac electrophysiology results showed that neither concentration of oyster solution was able to significantly reduce action potential duration at all phases of repolarisation in left ventricular papillary muscles from healthy animals.CONCLUSION: When administered to healthy vascular tissue, C. gigas oyster extract inhibits contraction induced by noradrenaline. This effect is likely to be mediated through ¦Á-adrenoceptor inhibition, and to a lesser extent, calcium modulating activity.","Journal of integrative medicine","26006032",2015,"Netherlands"
"PDGFR¦Á demarcates the cardiogenic clonogenic Sca1+ stem/progenitor cell in adult murine myocardium.","Cardiac progenitor/stem cells in adult hearts represent an attractive therapeutic target for heart regeneration, though (inter)-relationships among reported cells remain obscure. Using single-cell qRT-PCR and clonal analyses, here we define four subpopulations of cardiac progenitor/stem cells in adult mouse myocardium all sharing stem cell antigen-1 (Sca1), based on side population (SP) phenotype, PECAM-1 (CD31) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-¦Á (PDGFR¦Á) expression. SP status predicts clonogenicity and cardiogenic gene expression (Gata4/6, Hand2 and Tbx5/20), properties segregating more specifically to PDGFR¦Á(+) cells. Clonal progeny of single Sca1(+) SP cells show cardiomyocyte, endothelial and smooth muscle lineage potential after cardiac grafting, augmenting cardiac function although durable engraftment is rare. PDGFR¦Á(-) cells are characterized by Kdr/Flk1, Cdh5, CD31 and lack of clonogenicity. PDGFR¦Á(+)/CD31(-) cells derive from cells formerly expressing Mesp1, Nkx2-5, Isl1, Gata5 and Wt1, distinct from PDGFR¦Á(-)/CD31(+) cells (Gata5 low; Flk1 and Tie2 high).

"A novel collagen gel-based measurement  technique for quantitation of cell  contraction force.","Cell contraction force plays an important role in wound healing, inflammation,angiogenesis and metastasis. This study describes a novel method to quantify single cell contraction force in vitro using human aortic adventitial fibroblasts embedded in a collagen gel. The technique is based on a depth sensing nano-indentation tester to measure the thickness and elasticity of collagen gels containing stimulated fibroblasts and a microscopy imaging system to estimate the gel area. In parallel, a simple theoretical model has been developed to calculate cell contraction force based on the measured parameters. Histamine (100 mM) was used to stimulate fibroblast contraction while the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7 (25 mM) was used to inhibit cell contraction. The collagen matrix used in the model provides a physiological environment for fibroblast contraction studies. Measurement of changes in collagen gel elasticity and thickness arising from histamine treatments provides a novel convenient technique to measure cell contraction force within a collagen matrix. This study demonstrates that histamine can elicit a significant increase in contraction force of fibroblasts embedded in collagen,while the Young's modulus of the gel decreases due to the gel degradation.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","25977960",2015,"United Kingdom"
"Approximate analytical solutions for excitation and propagation in cardiac tissue.","It is well known that a variety of cardiac arrhythmias are initiated by a focal excitation in heart tissue. At the single cell level these currents are typically induced by intracellular processes such as spontaneous calcium release (SCR). However, it is not understood how the size and morphology of these focal excitations are related to the electrophysiological properties of cardiac cells. In this paper a detailed physiologically based ionic model is analyzed by projecting the excitation dynamics to a reduced one-dimensional parameter space. Based on this analysis we show that the inward current required for an excitation to occur is largely dictated by the voltage dependence of the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)), and is insensitive to the detailed properties of the sodium current. We derive an analytical expression relating the size of a stimulus and the critical current required to induce a propagating action potential (AP), and argue that this relationship determines the necessary number of cells that must undergo SCR in order to induce ectopic activity in cardiac tissue. Finally, we show that, once a focal excitation begins to propagate, its propagation characteristics, such as the conduction velocity and the critical radius for propagation, are largely determined by the sodium and gap junction currents with a substantially lesser effect due to repolarizing potassium currents. These results reveal the relationship between ion channel properties and important tissue scale processes such as excitation and propagation.","Physical review.

"Stochastic spontaneous calcium release events trigger premature ventricular complexes by overcoming electrotonic load.","AIMS: Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) due to spontaneous calcium (Ca) release (SCR) events at the cell level can precipitate ventricular arrhythmias. However, the mechanistic link between SCRs and PVC formation remains incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the conditions under which delayed afterdepolarizations resulting from stochastic subcellular SCR events can overcome electrotonic source-sink mismatch, leading to PVC initiation.METHODS AND RESULTS: A stochastic subcellular-scale mathematical model of SCR was incorporated in a realistic model of the rabbit ventricles and Purkinje system (PS). Elevated levels of diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) (CaSR) were imposed until triggered activity was observed, allowing us to compile statistics on probability, timing, and location of PVCs. At CaSR¡Ý 1500 ¦Ìmol/L PVCs originated in the PS. When SCR was incapacitated in the PS, PVCs also emerged in the ventricles, but at a higher CaSR (¡Ý1550 ¦Ìmol/L) and with longer waiting times. For each model configuration tested, the probability of PVC occurrence increased from 0 to 100% within a well-defined critical CaSR range; this transition was much more abrupt in organ-scale models (¡«50 ¦Ìmol/L CaSR range) than in the tissue strand (¡«100 ¦Ìmol/L) or single-cell (¡«450 ¦Ìmol/L) models. Among PVCs originating in the PS, ¡«68% were located near Purkinje-ventricular junctions (&lt;1 mm).CONCLUSION: SCR events overcome source-sink mismatch to trigger PVCs at a critical CaSR threshold. Above this threshold, PVCs emerge due to increased probability and reduced variability in timing of SCR events, leading to significant diastolic depolarization. Sites of lower electronic load, such as the PS, are preferential locations for triggering.","Cardiovascular research","25969391",2015,"United States"
"Comparing mouse and human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac cells: Both systems have advantages for pharmacological and toxicological screening.","Pluripotent stem cells offer an unparalleled opportunity to investigate cardiac physiology, pharmacology, toxicology and pathophysiology. In this paper we describe the use of both mouse (Nkx2-5(eGFP/w)) and human (NKX2-5(eGFP/w)) pluripotent stem cell reporter lines, differentiated toward cardiac lineage, for live single cell high acquisition rate calcium imaging. We also assess the potential of NKX2-5(eGFP/w) cardiac lineage cells for use toxicological screening as well as establish their sensitivity to a shift between low and high oxygen environments. Differentiated mouse Nkx2-5(eGFP/w) cells demonstrated a wide range of spontaneous oscillation rates that could be reduced by ryanodine (10¦ÌM), thapsigargin (1¦ÌM) and ZD7288 (10¦ÌM). In contrast human NKX2-5(eGFP/w) cell activity was only reduced by thapsigargin (1¦ÌM). Human cell survival was sensitive to the addition of trastuzumab and doxorubicin, while the switch from a low to a high oxygen environment affected oscillation frequency. We suggest that the human NKX2-5(eGFP/w) cells are less suitable for studies of compounds affecting cardiac pacemaker activity than mouse Nkx2-5(eGFP/w) cells, but are very suitable for cardiac toxicity studies.

"Activation of Notch1 signalling promotes multi-lineage differentiation of c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) bone marrow stem cells: implication in stem cell translational medicine.","INTRODUCTION: Transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can repair injured hearts. However, whether BMSC populations contain cells with cardiac stem cell characteristics is ill-defined. We report here that Notch signalling can promote differentiation of c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells.METHODS: Total BMSCs were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat femurs and c-Kit(POS) cells were purified. c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) cells were isolated by single-cell cloning, and the presence of cardiomyocyte, smooth muscle cell (SMC), and endothelial cell differentiation markers assessed by immunofluorescence staining and semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Levels of c-Kit and Notch1-4 in total BMSCs and c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs were quantitated by flow cytometry. Following infection with an adenovirus over-expressing Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), total BMSCs and c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) cells were assessed for differentiation to cardiomyocyte, SMC, and endothelial cell lineages by immunofluorescence staining and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Total BMSCs and c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) cells were treated with the Notch1 ligand Jagged1 and markers of cardiomyocyte, SMC, and endothelial cell differentiation were examined by immunofluorescence staining and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis.RESULTS: c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) cells were present among total BMSC populations, and these cells did not express markers of adult cardiomyocyte, SMC, or endothelial cell lineages. c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs exhibited a multi-lineage differentiation potential similar to total BMSCs. Following sorting, the c-Kit level in c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs was 84.4%. Flow cytometry revealed that Notch1 was the predominant Notch receptor present in total BMSCs and c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs. Total BMSCs and c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs overexpressing NICD had active Notch1 signalling accompanied by differentiation into cardiomyocyte, SMC, and endothelial cell lineages. Treatment of total BMSCs and c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs with exogenous Jagged1 activated Notch1 signalling and drove multi-lineage differentiation, with a tendency towards cardiac lineage differentiation in c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs.CONCLUSIONS: c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) cells exist in total BMSC pools. Activation of Notch1 signalling contributed to multi-lineage differentiation of c-Kit(POS)/NKX2.5(POS) BMSCs, favouring differentiation into cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that modulation of Notch1 signalling may have potential utility in stem cell translational medicine.","Stem cell research &amp; therapy","25956503",2015,"England"
"Nanostructured cavity devices for extracellular stimulation of HL-1 cells.","Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are state-of-the-art devices for extracellular recording and stimulation on biological tissue. Furthermore, they are a relevant tool for the development of biomedical applications like retina, cochlear and motor prostheses, cardiac pacemakers and drug screening. Hence, research on functional cell-sensor interfaces, as well as the development of new surface structures and modifications for improved electrode characteristics, is a vivid and well established field. However, combining single-cell resolution with sufficient signal coupling remains challenging due to poor cell-electrode sealing. Furthermore, electrodes with diameters below 20 ¦Ìm often suffer from a high electrical impedance affecting the noise during voltage recordings. In this study, we report on a nanocavity sensor array for voltage-controlled stimulation and extracellular action potential recordings on cellular networks. Nanocavity devices combine the advantages of low-impedance electrodes with small cell-chip interfaces, preserving a high spatial resolution for recording and stimulation. A reservoir between opening aperture and electrode is provided, allowing the cell to access the structure for a tight cell-sensor sealing. We present the well-controlled fabrication process and the effect of cavity formation and electrode patterning on the sensor's impedance. Further, we demonstrate reliable voltage-controlled stimulation using nanostructured cavity devices by capturing the pacemaker of an HL-1 cell network. ","Nanoscale","25939765",2015,"England"

"Neuropeptide receptor transcript expression levels and magnitude of ionic current responses show cell type-specific differences in a small motor circuit.","We studied the relationship between neuropeptide receptor transcript expression and current responses in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis. We identified a transcript with high sequence similarity to crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) receptors in insects and mammalian neuropeptide S receptors. This transcript was expressed throughout the nervous system, consistent with the role of CCAP in a range of different behaviors. In the STG, single-cell qPCR showed expression in only a subset of neurons. This subset had previously been shown to respond to CCAP with the activation of a modulator-activated inward current (IMI), with one exception. In the one cell type that showed expression but no IMI responses, we found CCAP modulation of synaptic currents. Expression levels within STG neuron types were fairly variable, but significantly different between some neuron types. We tested the magnitude and concentration dependence of IMI responses to CCAP application in two identified neurons, the lateral pyloric (LP) and the inferior cardiac (IC) neurons. LP had several-fold higher expression and showed larger current responses. It also was more sensitive to low CCAP concentrations and showed saturation at lower concentrations, as sigmoid fits showed smaller EC50 values and steeper slopes. In addition, occlusion experiments with proctolin, a different neuropeptide converging onto IMI, showed that saturating concentrations of CCAP activated all available IMI in LP, but only approximately two-thirds in IC, the neuron with lower receptor transcript expression. The implications of these findings for comodulation are discussed. ","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","25926455",2015,"United States"
"Laser capture microdissection: Big data from small samples.","Any tissue is made up of a heterogeneous mix of spatially distributed cell types. In response to any (patho) physiological cue, responses of each cell type in any given tissue may be unique and cannot be homogenized across cell-types and spatial co-ordinates. For example, in response to myocardial infarction, on one hand myocytes and fibroblasts of the heart tissue respond differently. On the other hand, myocytes in the infarct core respond differently compared to those in the peri-infarct zone. Therefore, isolation of pure targeted cells is an important and essential step for the molecular analysis of cells involved in the progression of disease. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is powerful to obtain a pure targeted cell subgroup, or even a single cell, quickly and precisely under the microscope, successfully tackling the problem of tissue heterogeneity in molecular analysis. This review presents an overview of LCM technology, the principles, advantages and limitations and its down-stream applications in the fields of proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics.

"Fabrication of a myocardial patch with cells differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells.","The incidence of cardiovascular disease represents a significant and growing health-care challenge to the developed and developing world. The ability of native heart muscle to regenerate in response to myocardial infarct is minimal. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches represent one promising response to this difficulty. Here, we present methods for the construction of a cell-seeded cardiac patch with the potential to promote regenerative outcomes in heart muscle with damage secondary to myocardial infarct. This method leverages iPS cells and a fibrin-based scaffold to create a simple and commercially viable tissue-engineered cardiac patch. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can, in principle, be differentiated into cells of any lineage. However, most of the protocols used to generate hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) are unsatisfactory because the yield and phenotypic stability of the hiPSC-ECs are low, and the hiPSC-CMs are often purified via selection for expression of a promoter-reporter construct. In this chapter, we describe an hiPSC-EC differentiation protocol that generates large numbers of stable ECs and an hiPSC-CM differentiation protocol that does not require genetic manipulation, single-cell selection, or sorting with fluorescent dyes or other reagents. We also provide a simple but effective method that can be used to combine hiPSC-ECs and hiPSC-CMs with hiPSC-derived smooth muscle cells to engineer a contracting patch of cardiac cells.

"Cardiac myocyte alternans in intact heart: Influence of cell-cell coupling and ¦Â-adrenergic stimulation.","BACKGROUND: Cardiac alternans are proarrhythmic and mechanistically link cardiac mechanical dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Beat-to-beat alternans occur when beats with large Ca(2+) transients and long action potential duration (APD) alternate with the converse. APD alternans are typically driven by Ca(2+) alternans and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release alternans. But the effect of intercellular communication via gap junctions (GJ) on alternans in the intact heart remains unknown.OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of cell-to-cell coupling on local alternans in intact Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts, measuring single myocyte [Ca(2+)] alternans synchronization among neighboring cells, and effects of ¦Â-adrenergic receptor (¦Â-AR) activation and reduced GJ coupling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse hearts (C57BL/6) were retrogradely perfused and loaded with Fluo8-AM to record cardiac myocyte [Ca(2+)] in situ with confocal microscopy. Single cell resolution allowed analysis of alternans within the intact organ during alternans induction. Carbenoxolone (25 ¦ÌM), a GJ inhibitor, significantly increased the occurrence and amplitude of alternans in single cells within the intact heart. Alternans were concordant between neighboring cells throughout the field of view, except transiently during onset. ¦Â-AR stimulation only reduced Ca(2+) alternans in tissue that had reduced GJ coupling, matching effects seen in isolated myocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Ca(2+) alternans among neighboring myocytes is predominantly concordant, likely because of electrical coupling between cells. Consistent with this, partial GJ uncoupling increased propensity and amplitude of Ca(2+) alternans, and made them more sensitive to reversal by ¦Â-AR activation, as in isolated myocytes. Electrical coupling between myocytes may thus limit the alternans initiation, but also allow alternans to be more stable once established.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","25828762",2015,"United States"
"Nickel suppresses the PACAP-induced increase in guinea pig cardiac neuron excitability.","Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a potent intercellular signaling molecule involved in multiple homeostatic functions. PACAP/PAC1 receptor signaling increases excitability of neurons within the guinea pig cardiac ganglia, making them a unique system to establish mechanisms underlying PACAP modulation of neuronal function. Calcium influx is required for the PACAP-increased cardiac neuron excitability, although the pathway is unknown. This study tested whether PACAP enhancement of calcium influx through either T-type or R-type channels contributed to the modulation of excitability. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated transcripts for Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 T-type isoforms and R-type Cav2.3 in cardiac neurons. These neurons often exhibit a hyperpolarization-induced rebound depolarization that remains when cesium is present to block hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cationic currents (Ih). The T-type calcium channel inhibitors, nickel (Ni(2+)) or mibefradil, suppressed the rebound depolarization, and treatment with both drugs hyperpolarized cardiac neurons by 2-4 mV. Together, these results are consistent with the presence of functional T-type channels, potentially along with R-type channels, in these cardiac neurons. Fifty micromolar Ni(2+), a concentration that suppresses currents in both T-type and R-type channels, blunted the PACAP-initiated increase in excitability. Ni(2+) also blunted PACAP enhancement of the hyperpolarization-induced rebound depolarization and reversed the PACAP-mediated increase in excitability, after being initiated, in a subset of cells. Lastly, low voltage-activated currents, measured under perforated patch whole cell recording conditions and potentially flowing through T-type or R-type channels, were enhanced by PACAP. Together, our results suggest that a PACAP-enhanced, Ni(2+)-sensitive current contributes to PACAP-induced modulation of neuronal excitability.","American journal of physiology.

To our knowledge, a novel mathematical framework was developed in this work to address the effect of current fluctuations on the IBIs of sinoatrial pacemaker cells. Using statistical modeling and employing the Fokker-Planck formalism, our mathematical analysis suggests that increased stochastic current fluctuation variance linearly increases the slope of phase-4 depolarization, hence the rate of activations. Single-cell and two-dimensional computerized numerical modeling of the sinoatrial node was conducted to validate the theoretical predictions using established ionic kinetics of the rabbit pacemaker and atrial cells. Our models also provide, to our knowledge, a novel complementary or alternative explanation to recent experimental observations showing a strong reduction in the mean IBI of Cx30 deficient mice in comparison to wild-types, not fully explicable by the effects of intercellular decoupling.

"The sinus venosus myocardium contributes to the atrioventricular canal: potential role during atrioventricular node development?","The presence of distinct electrophysiological pathways within the atrioventricular node (AVN) is a prerequisite for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia to occur. In this study, the different cell contributions that may account for the anatomical and functional heterogeneity of the AVN were investigated. To study the temporal development of the AVN, the expression pattern of ISL1, expressed in cardiac progenitor cells, was studied in sequential stages performing co-staining with myocardial markers (TNNI2 and NKX2-5) and HCN4 (cardiac conduction system marker). An ISL1+/TNNI2+/HCN4+ continuity between the myocardium of the sinus venosus and atrioventricular canal was identified in the region of the putative AVN, which showed a pacemaker-like phenotype based on single cell patch-clamp experiments. Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed that even during early development, different cell populations can be identified in the region of the putative AVN. Fate mapping was performed by in ovo vital dye microinjection. Embryos were harvested and analysed 24 and 48<U+00A0>hrs post-injection. These experiments showed incorporation of sinus venosus myocardium in the posterior region of the atrioventricular canal. The myocardium of the sinus venosus contributes to the atrioventricular canal. It is postulated that the myocardium of the sinus venosus contributes to nodal extensions or transitional cells of the AVN since these cells are located in the posterior region of the AVN. This finding may help to understand the origin of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. ","Journal of cellular and molecular medicine","25752780",2015,"England"
"A model model: a commentary on DiFrancesco and Noble (1985) 'A model of cardiac electrical activity incorporating ionic pumps and concentration changes'.","This paper summarizes the advances made by the DiFrancesco and Noble (DFN) model of cardiac cellular electrophysiology, which was published in Philosophical Transactions B in 1985. This model was developed at a time when the introduction of new techniques and provision of experimental data had resulted in an explosion of knowledge about the cellular and biophysical properties of the heart. It advanced the cardiac modelling field from a period when computer models considered only the voltage-dependent channels in the surface membrane. In particular, it included a consideration of changes of both intra- and extracellular ionic concentrations. In this paper, we summarize the most important contributions of the DiFrancesco and Noble paper. We also describe how computer modelling has developed subsequently with the extension from the single cell to the whole heart as well as its use in understanding disease and predicting the effects of pharmaceutical interventions.

"Studying the dynamics of coronavirus replicative structures.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) generate specialized membrane compartments, which consist of double membrane vesicles connected to convoluted membranes, the so-called replicative structures, where viral RNA synthesis takes place. These sites harbor the CoV replication-transcription complexes (RTCs): multi-protein complexes consisting of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), the CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) and presumably host proteins. To successfully establish functional membrane-bound RTCs all of the viral and host constituents need to be correctly spatiotemporally organized during viral infection. Few studies, however, have investigated the dynamic processes involved in the formation and functioning of the (subunits of) CoV RTCs and the replicative structures in living cells. In this chapter we describe several protocols to perform time-lapse imaging of CoV-infected cells and to study the kinetics of (subunits of) the CoV replicative structures. The approaches described are not limited to CoV-infected cells; they can also be applied to other virus-infected or non-infected cells.

"Analysis of long- and short-range contribution to adhesion work in cardiac fibroblasts: an atomic force microscopy study.","Atomic force microscopy (AFM) for single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) and Poisson statistic were used to analyze the detachment work recorded during the removal of gold-covered microspheres from cardiac fibroblasts. The effect of Cytochalasin D, a disruptor of the actin cytoskeleton, on cell adhesion was also tested. The adhesion work was assessed using a Poisson analysis also derived from single-cell force spectroscopy retracting curves. The use of Poisson analysis to get adhesion work from AFM curves is quite a novel method, and in this case, proved to be effective to study the short-range and long-range contributions to the adhesion work. This method avoids the difficult identification of minor peaks in the AFM retracting curves by creating what can be considered an average adhesion work. Even though the effect of actin depolymerisation is well documented, its use revealed that control cardiac fibroblasts (CT) exhibit a work of adhesion at least 5 times higher than that of the Cytochalasin treated cells. However, our results indicate that in both cells short-range and long-range contributions to the adhesion work are nearly equal and the same heterogeneity index describes both cells. Therefore, we infer that the different adhesion behaviors might be explained by the presence of fewer membrane adhesion molecules available at the AFM tip-cell interface under circumstances where the actin cytoskeleton has been disrupted.

"Are zebrafish larvae suitable for assessing the hepatotoxicity potential of drug candidates?","Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is poorly predicted by single-cell-based assays, probably because of the lack of physiological interactions with other cells within the liver. An intact whole liver system such as one present in zebrafish larvae could provide added value in a screening strategy for DILI; however, the possible occurrence of other organ toxicities and the immature larval stage of the zebrafish might complicate accurate and fast analysis. We investigated whether expression analysis of liver-specific fatty acid binding protein 10a (lfabp10a) was an appropriate endpoint for assessing hepatotoxic effects in zebrafish larvae. It was found that expression analysis of lfabp10a was a valid marker, as after treatment with hepatotoxicants, dose-response curves could be obtained and statistically significant abnormal lfabp10 expression levels correlated with hepatocellular histopathological changes in the liver. However, toxicity in other vital organs such as the heart could impact liver outgrowth and thus had to be assessed concurrently. Whether zebrafish larvae were suitable for assessing human relevant drug-induced hepatotoxicity was assessed with hepatotoxicants and non-hepatotoxicants that have been marketed for human use and classified according to their mechanism of toxicity. The zebrafish larva showed promising predictivity towards a number of mechanisms and was capable of distinguishing between hepatotoxic and non-hepatotoxic chemical analogues, thus implying its applicability as a potential screening model for DILI.","Journal of applied toxicology : JAT","25663337",2015,"England"
"Rosiglitazone promotes AQP2 plasma membrane expression in renal cells via a Ca-dependent/cAMP-independent mechanism.","AIMS: Thiazolidinediones are highly beneficial in the treatment of type II diabetes. However, they are also associated with edema and increased risk of congestive heart failure. Several studies demonstrated that rosiglitazone (RGZ) increases the abundance of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) at the plasma membrane of renal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether RGZ might activate a transduction pathway facilitating AQP2 membrane accumulation in renal cells.METHODS: We analyzed the effect of RGZ on renal AQP2 intracellular trafficking in MCD4 renal cells by confocal microscopy and apical surface biotinylation. Cytosolic Ca(2+) dynamics were measured by a video-imaging approach in single cell. Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels expression was determined by RT-PCR.RESULTS: We showed that in MCD4 cells, short-term exposure to RGZ dramatically increases the amount of apically expressed AQP2 independently on cAMP production, PKA activation and AQP2 phosphorylation. RGZ elicited a cytosolic Ca(2+) transient due to Ca(2+) influx prevented by ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of TRP plasma membrane channels. We identified TRPV6 as the possible candidate mediating this effect.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results provide a possible molecular mechanism explaining the increased AQP2 membrane expression under RGZ treatment: in renal cells RGZ elicits Ca(2+) transients facilitating AQP2 exposure at the apical plasma membrane, thus increasing collecting duct water permeability. Importantly, this effect suggests an unexplored application of RGZ in the treatment of pathological states characterized by impaired AQP2 trafficking at the plasma membrane.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","25662477",2015,"Italy"
"Identification of cardiovascular lineage descendants at single-cell resolution.","The transcriptional profiles of cardiac cells derived from murine embryos and from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have primarily been studied within a cell population. However, the characterization of gene expression in these cells at a single-cell level might demonstrate unique variations that cannot be appreciated within a cell pool. In this study, we aimed to establish a single-cell quantitative PCR platform and perform side-by-side comparison between cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from mESCs and mouse embryos. We first generated a reference map for cardiovascular single cells through quantifying lineage-defining genes for CPCs, CMs, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (EDCs), fibroblasts and mESCs. This panel was then applied against single embryonic day 10.5 heart cells to demonstrate its ability to identify each endocardial cell and chamber-specific CM. In addition, we compared the gene expression profile of embryo- and mESC-derived CPCs and CMs at different developmental stages and showed that mESC-derived CMs are phenotypically similar to embryo-derived CMs up to the neonatal stage. Furthermore, we showed that single-cell expression assays coupled with time-lapse microscopy can resolve the identity and the lineage relationships between progenies of single cultured CPCs. With this approach, we found that mESC-derived Nkx2-5(+) CPCs preferentially become SMCs or CMs, whereas single embryo-derived Nkx2-5(+) CPCs represent two phenotypically distinct subpopulations that can become either EDCs or CMs. These results demonstrate that multiplex gene expression analysis in single cells is a powerful tool for examining the unique behaviors of individual embryo- or mESC-derived cardiac cells.

"Variable activation of the DNA damage response pathways in patients undergoing single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging.","BACKGROUND: Although single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) has improved the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with suspected coronary artery disease, it remains a primary source of low-dose radiation exposure for cardiac patients. To determine the biological effects of low-dose radiation from SPECT MPI, we measured the activation of the DNA damage response pathways using quantitative flow cytometry and single-cell gene expression profiling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples were collected from patients before and after SPECT MPI (n=63). Overall, analysis of all recruited patients showed no marked differences in the phosphorylation of proteins (H2AX, protein 53, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated) after SPECT. The majority of patients also had either downregulated or unchanged expression in DNA damage response genes at both 24 and 48 hours post-SPECT. Interestingly, a small subset of patients with increased phosphorylation had significant upregulation of genes associated with DNA damage, whereas those with no changes in phosphorylation had significant downregulation or no difference, suggesting that some patients may potentially be more sensitive to low-dose radiation exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that SPECT MPI resulted in a variable activation of the DNA damage response pathways. Although only a small subset of patients had increased protein phosphorylation and elevated gene expression postimaging, continued care should be taken to reduce radiation exposure to both the patients and operators.","Circulation.

"Systemic gene transfer enables optogenetic pacing of mouse hearts.","AIMS: Optogenetic pacing of the heart has been demonstrated in transgenic animals expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). However, for the clinical use of optogenetics to treat cardiac arrhythmias, gene transfer to non-transgenic hearts is required. The aim of this study was to describe a reliable method for gene transfer of ChR2 into a sufficient percentage of cardiomyocytes to overcome the electrical sink of all the coupled non-expressing cardiomyocytes during optical pacing of the whole heart in vivo.METHODS AND RESULTS: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) with cardiac tropism for expression of ChR2 in fusion with mCherry was systemically injected into wild-type mouse hearts. Bright mCherry fluorescence was detected in the whole heart 4-10 weeks later. Single-cell dissociation revealed that on average 58% cardiomyocytes were mCherry-positive. These showed light-induced inward currents, action potentials, and contractions. Pulsed illumination of the left ventricle induced ventricular pacing in vivo in 74% of mice, and higher light intensities were required for reduced pulse duration or size of illumination. Non-responding hearts showed low AAV expression, and the threshold for optical pacing was estimated to be 35-40% ChR2-expressing cardiomyocytes. Optical pacing in vivo was stable over extended periods without negative effects on normal sinus rhythm and ECG parameters after termination of stimulation indicating sufficient cardiac output during pacing.CONCLUSIONS: Gene transfer generates sufficient ChR2 photocurrent for reliable optogenetic pacing in vivo and lays out the basis for future optogenetic pacemaker and pain-free defibrillation therapies.","Cardiovascular research","25587047",2015,"England"
"SHOX2 overexpression favors differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiac pacemaker cells, improving biological pacing ability.","When pluripotency factors are removed, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergo spontaneous differentiation, which, among other lineages, also gives rise to cardiac sublineages, including chamber cardiomyocytes and pacemaker cells. Such heterogeneity complicates the use of ESC-derived heart cells in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. We sought to direct ESCs to differentiate specifically into cardiac pacemaker cells by overexpressing a transcription factor critical for embryonic patterning of the native cardiac pacemaker (the sinoatrial node). Overexpression of SHOX2 during ESC differentiation upregulated the pacemaker gene program, resulting in enhanced automaticity in<U+00A0>vitro and induced biological pacing upon transplantation in<U+00A0>vivo. The accentuated automaticity is accompanied by temporally evolving changes in the effectors and regulators of Wnt signaling. Our findings provide a strategy for enriching the cardiac pacemaker cell population from ESCs. ","Stem cell reports","25533636",2014,"United States"
"D-Glucose-Induced Cytotoxic, Genotoxic, and Apoptotic Effects on Human Breast Adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) Cells.","INTRODUCTION: Glucose is a simple sugar that plays an important role in energy production in biological systems. However, it has been linked to many long-term health problems including the risk of heart disease and stroke, erectile dysfunction in men and pregnancy complications in women, and damage to the kidneys, nerves, eye and vision. Also, the underlying mechanisms of diabetic complications are poorly understood.RESULTS: The results of MTT assay indicated that D-glucose significantly reduces the viability of MCF-7 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Similar trend was obtained with the trypan blue exclusion test. Data obtained from the Comet assay indicated that D-glucose causes DNA damage in MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The flow cytometry assessment (Annexin V FITC/PI) showed a strong dose-response relationship between D-glucose exposure and annexin V positive MCF-7 cells undergoing early apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Taking together, these data provide clear evidence that D-glucose induces cytotoxic, genotoxic, and apoptotic effects on MCF-7 cells.

"Single-cell analysis reveals gene-expression heterogeneity in syntrophic dual-culture of Desulfovibrio vulgaris with Methanosarcina barkeri.","Microbial syntrophic metabolism has been well accepted as the heart of how methanogenic and other anaerobic microbial communities function. In this work, we applied a single-cell RT-qPCR approach to reveal gene-expression heterogeneity in a model syntrophic system of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Methanosarcina barkeri, as compared with the D. vulgaris monoculture. Using the optimized primers and single-cell analytical protocol, we quantitatively determine gene-expression levels of 6 selected target genes in each of the 120 single cells of D. vulgaris isolated from its monoculture and dual-culture with M. barkeri. The results demonstrated very significant cell-to-cell gene-expression heterogeneity for the selected D. vulgaris genes in both the monoculture and the syntrophic dual-culture. Interestingly, no obvious increase in gene-expression heterogeneity for the selected genes was observed for the syntrophic dual-culture when compared with its monoculture, although the community structure and cell-cell interactions have become more complicated in the syntrophic dual-culture. In addition, the single-cell RT-qPCR analysis also provided further evidence that the gene cluster (DVU0148-DVU0150) may be involved syntrophic metabolism between D. vulgaris and M. barkeri. Finally, the study validated that single-cell RT-qPCR analysis could be a valuable tool in deciphering gene functions and metabolism in mixed-cultured microbial communities.

"Disrupted calcium release as a mechanism for atrial alternans associated with human atrial fibrillation.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, but our knowledge of the arrhythmogenic substrate is incomplete. Alternans, the beat-to-beat alternation in the shape of cardiac electrical signals, typically occurs at fast heart rates and leads to arrhythmia. However, atrial alternans have been observed at slower pacing rates in AF patients than in controls, suggesting that increased vulnerability to arrhythmia in AF patients may be due to the proarrythmic influence of alternans at these slower rates. As such, alternans may present a useful therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of AF, but the mechanism underlying alternans occurrence in AF patients at heart rates near rest is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine how cellular changes that occur in human AF affect the appearance of alternans at heart rates near rest. To achieve this, we developed a computational model of human atrial tissue incorporating electrophysiological remodeling associated with chronic AF (cAF) and performed parameter sensitivity analysis of ionic model parameters to determine which cellular changes led to alternans. Of the 20 parameters tested, only decreasing the ryanodine receptor (RyR) inactivation rate constant (kiCa) produced action potential duration (APD) alternans seen clinically at slower pacing rates. Using single-cell clamps of voltage, fluxes, and state variables, we determined that alternans onset was Ca2+-driven rather than voltage-driven and occurred as a result of decreased RyR inactivation which led to increased steepness of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release slope. Iterated map analysis revealed that because SR Ca2+ uptake efficiency was much higher in control atrial cells than in cAF cells, drastic reductions in kiCa were required to produce alternans at comparable pacing rates in control atrial cells. These findings suggest that RyR kinetics may play a critical role in altered Ca2+ homeostasis which drives proarrhythmic APD alternans in patients with AF.

"A thin layer angiogenesis assay: a modified basement matrix assay for assessment of endothelial cell differentiation.","BACKGROUND: Basement matrices such as Matrigel<U+2122> and Geltrex<U+2122> are used in a variety of cell culture assays of anchorage-dependent differentiation including endothelial cell tube formation assays. The volumes of matrix recommended for these assays (approximately 150 ¦Ìl/cm(2)) are costly, limit working distances for microscopy, and require cell detachment for subsequent molecular analysis. Here we describe the development and validation of a thin-layer angiogenesis (TLA) assay for assessing the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells that overcomes these limitations.RESULTS: Geltrex<U+2122> basement matrix at 5 ¦Ìl/cm(2) in 24-well (10 ¦Ìl) or 96-well (2 ¦Ìl) plates supports endothelial cell differentiation into tube-like structures in a comparable manner to the standard larger volumes of matrix. Since working distances are reduced, high-resolution single cell microscopy, including DIC and confocal imaging, can be used readily. Using MitoTracker dye we now demonstrate, for the first time, live mitochondrial dynamics and visualise the 3-dimensional network of mitochondria present in differentiated endothelial cells. Using a standard commercial total RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) we also show direct RNA extraction and RT-qPCR from differentiated endothelial cells without the need to initially detach cells from their supporting matrix.CONCLUSIONS: We present here a new thin-layer assay (TLA) for measuring the anchorage-dependent differentiation of endothelial cells into tube-like structures which retains all the characteristics of the traditional approach but with the added benefit of a greatly lowered cost and better compatibility with other techniques, including RT-qPCR and high-resolution microscopy.","BMC cell biology","25476021",2014,"United Kingdom"

"TNF-¦Á-mediated adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells-The role of ephrinA1.","The ligand ephrin A1 is more often discussed to play a role in the development of the atherosclerotic plaque and in this context especially in the monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. As tumor necrosis factor-¦Á (TNF-¦Á) is known to induce monocyte adhesion to endothelium and ephrin A1 expression, the present study focuses on the involvement of ephrin A1 in TNF-¦Á-mediated monocyte adhesion. The analysis of different members of the Eph/ephrin system in TNF-¦Á-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) revealed that especially ephrinA1 was found to be highly regulated by TNF-¦Á compared to other members of the Eph family. This effect is also present in arterial endothelial cells from the umbilical artery and from the coronary artery. This regulation is dependent on NF¦ÊB-activation as shown by the expression of a constitutive-active I¦ÊB-mutant. By using siRNA-mediated silencing and adenoviral overexpression of ephrinA1 in HUVEC, the involvement of ephrinA1 in the TNF-¦Á triggered monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells could be demonstrated. In addition, these results could be verified by quantitative adhesion measurement using atomic force microscopy-based single-cell force spectroscopy and under flow conditions. Furthermore, this effect is mediated via the EphA4 receptor. EphrinA1 does not influence the mRNA or protein expression of the adhesion receptors VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. However, the surface presentation of these adhesion receptors is modulated in an ephrinA1-dependent manner. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that ephrinA1 plays an important role in the TNF-¦Á-mediated adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells, which might be of great importance in the context of atherosclerosis.

"The role of short term memory and conduction velocity restitution in alternans formation.","Alternans is the periodic beat-to-beat short-long alternation in action potential duration (APD), which is considered to be a precursor of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In extended cardiac tissue, electrical alternans can be either spatially concordant (SCA, all cells oscillate in phase) or spatially discordant (SDA, cells in different regions oscillate out of phase). SDA gives rise to an increase in the spatial dispersion of repolarization, which is thought to be proarrhythmic. In this paper, we investigated the effect of two aspects of short term memory (STM) (¦Á, ¦Ó) and their interplay with conduction velocity (CV) restitution on alternans formation using numerical simulations of a mapping model with two beats of memory. Here, ¦Á quantifies the dependence of APD restitution on pacing history and ¦Ó characterizes APD accommodation, which is an exponential change of APD over time once basic cycle length (BCL) changes. Our main findings are as follows: In both single cell and spatially coupled homogeneous cable, the interplay between ¦Á and ¦Ó affects the dynamical behaviors of the system. For the case of large APD accommodation (¦Ó ¡Ý 290 ms), increase in ¦Á leads to suppression of alternans. However, if APD accommodation is small (¦Ó ¡Ü 250 ms), increase in ¦Á leads to appearance of additional alternans region. On the other hand, the slope of CV restitution does not change the regions of alternans in the cable. However, steep CV restitution leads to more complicated dynamical behaviors of the system. Specifically, SDA instead of SCA are observed. In addition, for steep CV restitution and sufficiently large ¦Ó, we observed formations of type II conduction block (CB2), transition from type I conduction block (CB1) to CB2, and unstable nodes.","Journal of theoretical biology","25435411",2014,"England"

"NS5806 partially restores action potential duration but fails to ameliorate calcium transient dysfunction in a computational model of canine heart failure.","AIMS: The study investigates how increased Ito, as mediated by the activator NS5806, affects excitation-contraction coupling in chronic heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that restoring spike-and-dome morphology of the action potential (AP) to a healthy phenotype would be insufficient to restore the intracellular Ca(2) (+) transient (CaT), due to HF-induced remodelling of Ca(2+) handling.METHODS AND RESULTS: An existing mathematical model of the canine ventricular myocyte was modified to incorporate recent experimental data from healthy and failing myocytes, resulting in models of both healthy and HF epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell variants. Affects of NS5806 were also included in HF models through its direct interaction with Kv4.3 and Kv1.4. Single-cell simulations performed in all models (control, HF, and HF + drug) and variants (epi, mid, and endo) assessed AP morphology and underlying ionic processes with a focus on calcium transients (CaT), how these were altered in HF across the ventricular wall, and the subsequent effects of varying compound concentration in HF. Heart failure model variants recapitulated a characteristic increase in AP duration (APD) in the disease. The qualitative effects of application of half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of NS5806 on APs and CaT are heterogeneous and non-linear. Deepening in the AP notch with drug is a direct effect of the activation of Ito; both Ito and consequent alteration of IK1 kinetics cause decrease in AP plateau potential. Decreased APD50 and APD90 are both due to altered IK1. Analysis revealed that drug effects depend on transmurality. Ca(2+) transient morphology changes-increased amplitude and shorter time to peak-are due to direct increase in ICa,L and indirect larger SR Ca(2+) release subsequent to Ito activation.CONCLUSIONS: Downstream effects of a compound acting exclusively on sarcolemmal ion channels are difficult to predict. Remediation of APD to pre-failing state does not ameliorate dysfunction in CaT; however, restoration of notch depth appears to impart modest benefit and a likelihood of therapeutic value in modulating early repolarization.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology","25362170",2014,"England"
"Single Cell Multiplex Protein Measurements through Rare Earth Element Immunolabeling, Laser Capture Microdissection and Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry.","Complex diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and aging are the primary causes of death in the US. These diseases cause heterogeneous conditions among cells, conditions that cannot be measured in tissue homogenates and require single cell approaches. Understanding protein levels within tissues is currently assayed using various molecular biology techniques (e.g., Western blots) that rely on milligram to gram quantities of tissue homogenates or immunofluorescent (IF) techniques that are limited by spectral overlap. Tissue homogenate studies lack references to tissue structure and mask signals from individual or rare cellular events. Novel techniques are required to bring protein measurement sensitivity to the single cell level and offer spatiotemporal resolution and scalability. We are developing a novel approach to protein quantification by exploiting the inherently low concentration of rare earth elements (REE) in biological systems. By coupling REE-antibody immunolabeling of cells with laser capture microdissection (LCM) and ICP-QQQ, we are achieving multiplexed protein measurement in histological sections of single cells. This approach will add to evolving single cell techniques and our ability to understand cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems and diseases.","Journal of cytology &amp; histology","27239387",2014,"United States"
"What makes a blood cell based miRNA expression pattern disease specific?--a miRNome analysis of blood cell subsets in lung cancer patients and healthy controls.","There is evidence of blood-borne miRNA signatures for various human diseases. To dissect the origin of disease-specific miRNA expression in human blood, we separately analyzed the miRNome of different immune cell subtypes, each in lung cancer patients and healthy individuals. Each immune cell type revealed a specific miRNA expression pattern also dependinging on the cell origin, line of defense, and function. The overall expression pattern of each leukocyte subtype showed great similarities between patients and controls. However, for each cell subtype we identified miRNAs that were deregulated in lung cancer patients including hsa-miR-21, a well-known oncomiR associated with poor lung cancer prognosis that was up-regulated in all leukocyte subtype comparisons of cancer versus controls. While the miRNome of cells of the adaptive immune system allowed only a weak separation between patients and controls, cells of the innate immune system allowed perfect or nearly perfect classification. Leukocytes of lung cancer patients show a cancer-specific miRNA expression profile. Our data also show that cancer specific miRNA expression pattern of whole blood samples are not determined by a single cell type. The data indicate that additional blood components, like erythrocytes, platelets, or exosomes might contribute to the disease specificity of a miRNA signature.

"Aggravation of cardiac myofibroblast arrhythmogeneicity by mechanical stress.","AIMS: Myofibroblasts (MFBs) as appearing in the myocardium during fibrotic remodelling induce slow conduction following heterocellular gap junctional coupling with cardiomyocytes (CMCs) in bioengineered tissue preparations kept under isometric conditions. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that strain as developed during diastolic filling of the heart chambers may modulate MFB-dependent slow conduction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of defined levels of strain on single-cell electrophysiology (patch clamp) and impulse conduction in patterned growth cell strands (optical mapping) were investigated in neonatal rat ventricular cell cultures (Wistar) grown on flexible substrates. While 10.5% strain only minimally affected conduction times in control CMC strands (+3.2%, n.s.), it caused a significant slowing of conduction in the fibrosis model consisting of CMC strands coated with MFBs (conduction times +26.3%). Increased sensitivity to strain of the fibrosis model was due to activation of mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) in both CMCs and MFBs that aggravated the MFB-dependent baseline depolarization of CMCs. As found in non-strained preparations, baseline depolarization of CMCs was partly due to the presence of constitutively active MSCs in coupled MFBs. Constitutive activity of MSCs was not dependent on the contractile state of MFBs, because neither stimulation (thrombin) nor suppression (blebbistatin) thereof significantly affected conduction velocities in the non-strained fibrosis model.CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that both constitutive and strain-induced activity of MSCs in MFBs significantly enhance their depolarizing effect on electrotonically coupled CMCs. Ensuing aggravation of slow conduction may contribute to the precipitation of strain-related arrhythmias in fibrotically remodelled hearts.","Cardiovascular research","25344366",2014,"England"
"Induction of diverse cardiac cell types by reprogramming fibroblasts with cardiac transcription factors.","Various combinations of cardiogenic transcription factors, including Gata4 (G), Hand2 (H), Mef2c (M) and Tbx5 (T), can reprogram fibroblasts into induced cardiac-like myocytes (iCLMs) in vitro and in vivo. Given that optimal cardiac function relies on distinct yet functionally interconnected atrial, ventricular and pacemaker (PM) cardiomyocytes (CMs), it remains to be seen which subtypes are generated by direct reprogramming and whether this process can be harnessed to produce a specific CM of interest. Here, we employ a PM-specific Hcn4-GFP reporter mouse and a spectrum of CM subtype-specific markers to investigate the range of cellular phenotypes generated by reprogramming of primary fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, we find that a combination of four transcription factors (4F) optimized for Hcn4-GFP expression does not generate beating PM cells due to inadequate sarcomeric protein expression and organization. However, applying strict single-cell criteria to GHMT-reprogrammed cells, we observe induction of diverse cellular phenotypes, including those resembling immature forms of all three major cardiac subtypes (i.e. atrial, ventricular and pacemaker). In addition, we demonstrate that cells induced by GHMT are directly reprogrammed and do not arise from an Nxk2.5(+) progenitor cell intermediate. Taken together, our results suggest a remarkable degree of plasticity inherent to GHMT reprogramming and provide a starting point for optimization of CM subtype-specific reprogramming protocols.","Development (Cambridge, England)","25344074",2014,"United States"
"Transcriptional repressor Tbx3 is required for the hormone-sensing cell lineage in mammary epithelium.","The transcriptional repressor Tbx3 is involved in lineage specification in several tissues during embryonic development. Germ-line mutations in the Tbx3 gene give rise to Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome (comprising reduced breast development) and Tbx3 is required for mammary epithelial cell identity in the embryo. Notably Tbx3 has been implicated in breast cancer, which develops in adult mammary epithelium, but the role of Tbx3 in distinct cell types of the adult mammary gland has not yet been characterized. Using a fluorescent reporter knock-in mouse, we show that in adult virgin mice Tbx3 is highly expressed in luminal cells that express hormone receptors, and not in luminal cells of the alveolar lineage (cells primed for milk production). Flow cytometry identified Tbx3 expression already in progenitor cells of the hormone-sensing lineage and co-immunofluorescence confirmed a strict correlation between estrogen receptor (ER) and Tbx3 expression in situ. Using in vivo reconstitution assays we demonstrate that Tbx3 is functionally relevant for this lineage because knockdown of Tbx3 in primary mammary epithelial cells prevented the formation of ER+ cells, but not luminal ER- or basal cells. Interestingly, genes that are repressed by Tbx3 in other cell types, such as E-cadherin, are not repressed in hormone-sensing cells, highlighting that transcriptional targets of Tbx3 are cell type specific. In summary, we provide the first analysis of Tbx3 expression in the adult mammary gland at a single cell level and show that Tbx3 is important for the generation of hormone-sensing cells.

"Single-cell microinjection coupled to confocal microscopy to characterize nuclear membrane receptors in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes.","Lipid bilayers, such as the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope, serve as effective cellular barriers to ions and macromolecules, thus allowing regulated access to subcellular compartments including the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Of course, these barriers are semipermeable and a wide variety of proteins including transporters, ion exchangers, pumps, and ion channels are required to permit access as well as establish and maintain molecular and ionic gradients across membranes. However, some experimental designs, such as specifically targeting intracellular receptors, require the administration of membrane-impermeable molecules directly into live cells. The microinjection technique described in this chapter is an efficient, technically simple, and reliable approach that can be used to introduce macromolecules into intracellular compartments while maintaining the integrity of the plasma membrane itself.

"Network analysis of time-lapse microscopy recordings.","Multicellular organisms rely on intercellular communication to regulate important cellular processes critical to life. To further our understanding of those processes there is a need to scrutinize dynamical signaling events and their functions in both cells and organisms. Here, we report a method and provide MATLAB code that analyzes time-lapse microscopy recordings to identify and characterize network structures within large cell populations, such as interconnected neurons. The approach is demonstrated using intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) recordings in neural progenitors and cardiac myocytes, but could be applied to a wide variety of biosensors employed in diverse cell types and organisms. In this method, network structures are analyzed by applying cross-correlation signal processing and graph theory to single-cell recordings. The goal of the analysis is to determine if the single cell activity constitutes a network of interconnected cells and to decipher the properties of this network. The method can be applied in many fields of biology in which biosensors are used to monitor signaling events in living cells. Analyzing intercellular communication in cell ensembles can reveal essential network structures that provide important biological insights.

"Transcriptional diversity during lineage commitment of human blood progenitors.","Blood cells derive from hematopoietic stem cells through stepwise fating events. To characterize gene expression programs driving lineage choice, we sequenced RNA from eight primary human hematopoietic progenitor populations representing the major myeloid commitment stages and the main lymphoid stage. We identified extensive cell type-specific expression changes: 6711 genes and 10,724 transcripts, enriched in non-protein-coding elements at early stages of differentiation. In addition, we found 7881 novel splice junctions and 2301 differentially used alternative splicing events, enriched in genes involved in regulatory processes. We demonstrated experimentally cell-specific isoform usage, identifying nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) as a regulator of megakaryocyte maturation-the platelet precursor. Our data highlight the complexity of fating events in closely related progenitor populations, the understanding of which is essential for the advancement of transplantation and regenerative medicine.

"Stochasticity intrinsic to coupled-clock mechanisms underlies beat-to-beat variability of spontaneous action potential firing in sinoatrial node pacemaker cells.","Recent evidence indicates that the spontaneous action potential (AP) of isolated sinoatrial node cells (SANCs) is regulated by a system of stochastic mechanisms embodied within two clocks: ryanodine receptors of the &quot;Ca(2+) clock&quot; within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, spontaneously activate during diastole and discharge local Ca(2+) releases (LCRs) beneath the cell surface membrane; clock crosstalk occurs as LCRs activate an inward Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger current (INCX), which together with If and decay of K(+) channels prompts the &quot;M clock,&quot; the ensemble of sarcolemmal-electrogenic molecules, to generate APs. Prolongation of the average LCR period accompanies prolongation of the average AP beating interval (BI). Moreover, the prolongation of the average AP BI accompanies increased AP BI variability. We hypothesized that both the average AP BI and AP BI variability are dependent upon stochasticity of clock mechanisms reported by the variability of LCR period. We perturbed the coupled-clock system by directly inhibiting the M clock by ivabradine (IVA) or the Ca(2+) clock by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). When either clock is perturbed by IVA (3, 10 and 30 ¦ÌM), which has no direct effect on Ca(2+) cycling, or CPA (0.5 and 5 ¦ÌM), which has no direct effect on the M clock ion channels, the clock system failed to achieve the basal AP BI and both AP BI and AP BI variability increased. The changes in average LCR period and its variability in response to perturbations of the coupled-clock system were correlated with changes in AP beating interval and AP beating interval variability. We conclude that the stochasticity within the coupled-clock system affects and is affected by the AP BI firing rate and rhythm via modulation of the effectiveness of clock coupling.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","25257916",2014,"United States"
"Single-cell analyses of regulatory network perturbations using enhancer-targeting TALEs suggest novel roles for PU.1 during haematopoietic specification.","Transcription factors (TFs) act within wider regulatory networks to control cell identity and fate. Numerous TFs, including Scl (Tal1) and PU.1 (Spi1), are known regulators of developmental and adult haematopoiesis, but how they act within wider TF networks is still poorly understood. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are a novel class of genetic tool based on the modular DNA-binding domains of Xanthomonas TAL proteins, which enable DNA sequence-specific targeting and the manipulation of endogenous gene expression. Here, we report TALEs engineered to target the PU.1-14kb and Scl+40kb transcriptional enhancers as efficient new tools to perturb the expression of these key haematopoietic TFs. We confirmed the efficiency of these TALEs at the single-cell level using high-throughput RT-qPCR, which also allowed us to assess the consequences of both PU.1 activation and repression on wider TF networks during developmental haematopoiesis. Combined with comprehensive cellular assays, these experiments uncovered novel roles for PU.1 during early haematopoietic specification. Finally, transgenic mouse studies confirmed that the PU.1-14kb element is active at sites of definitive haematopoiesis in vivo and PU.1 is detectable in haemogenic endothelium and early committing blood cells. We therefore establish TALEs as powerful new tools to study the functionality of transcriptional networks that control developmental processes such as early haematopoiesis.

"Fitting membrane resistance along with action potential shape in cardiac myocytes improves convergence: application of a multi-objective parallel genetic algorithm.","Fitting parameter sets of non-linear equations in cardiac single cell ionic models to reproduce experimental behavior is a time consuming process. The standard procedure is to adjust maximum channel conductances in ionic models to reproduce action potentials (APs) recorded in isolated cells. However, vastly different sets of parameters can produce similar APs. Furthermore, even with an excellent AP match in case of single cell, tissue behaviour may be very different. We hypothesize that this uncertainty can be reduced by additionally fitting membrane resistance (Rm). To investigate the importance of Rm, we developed a genetic algorithm approach which incorporated Rm data calculated at a few points in the cycle, in addition to AP morphology. Performance was compared to a genetic algorithm using only AP morphology data. The optimal parameter sets and goodness of fit as computed by the different methods were compared. First, we fit an ionic model to itself, starting from a random parameter set. Next, we fit the AP of one ionic model to that of another. Finally, we fit an ionic model to experimentally recorded rabbit action potentials. Adding the extra objective (Rm, at a few voltages) to the AP fit, lead to much better convergence. Typically, a smaller MSE (mean square error, defined as the average of the squared error between the target AP and AP that is to be fitted) was achieved in one fifth of the number of generations compared to using only AP data. Importantly, the variability in fit parameters was also greatly reduced, with many parameters showing an order of magnitude decrease in variability. Adding Rm to the objective function improves the robustness of fitting, better preserving tissue level behavior, and should be incorporated. ","PloS one","25250956",2014,"United States"
"Longstanding complex regional pain syndrome is associated with activating autoantibodies against alpha-1a adrenoceptors.","Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a limb-confined posttraumatic pain syndrome with sympathetic features. The cause is unknown, but the results of a randomized crossover trial on low-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) treatment point to a possible autoimmune mechanism. We tested purified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) from patients with longstanding CRPS for evidence of antibodies interacting with autonomic receptors on adult primary cardiomyocytes, comparing with control IgG from healthy and diseased controls, and related the results to the clinical response to treatment with low-dose IVIG. We simultaneously recorded both single-cell contractions and intracellular calcium handling in an electrical field. Ten of 18 CRPS preparations and only 1/57 control preparations (P&lt;0.0001) increased the sensitivity of the myocytes to the electric field, and this effect was abrogated by preincubation with ¦Á-1a receptor blockers. By contrast, effects on baseline calcium were blocked by preincubation with atropine. Interestingly, serum-IgG preparations from all 4 CRPS patients who had responded to low-dose IVIG with meaningful pain relief were effective in these assays, although 4/8 of the nonresponders were also active. To see if there were antibodies to the ¦Á-1a receptor, CRPS-IgG was applied to ¦Á-1a receptor-transfected rat-1 fibroblast cells. The CRPS serum IgG induced calcium flux, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that there was serum IgG binding to the cells. The results suggest that patients with longstanding CRPS have serum antibodies to ¦Á-1a receptors, and that measurement of these antibodies may be useful in the diagnosis and management of the patients.

"Single-cell analysis for BDNF and TrkB receptors in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.","Recent studies revealed that BDNF-TrkB pathway plays an important role in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) mediated myocardial angiogenesis. Single-cell analysis is a powerful tool for studying gene expression in individuals since cellular heterogeneity and dynamic microenvironments which individual cell will experience. Little is currently known about the expression of BDNF and TrkB receptors at the single CMEC level. Our single-cell analysis of seven randomly selected CMECs for BDNF and TrkB receptors (FL, T1, T2) showed that under an in vitro culture environment, BDNF was expressed in two of the seven selected CMECs. None of the single CMEC expressed TrkB-FL. TrkB-T1 was expressed in all seven selected CMECs, while, TrkB-T2 was expressed in three of these. In addition, none of single CMEC was found to express both BDNF and three TrkB receptors or BDNF and TrkB-FL simultaneously. These results suggest that a stochastic or random expression pattern for BDNF and their receptors might be set in each of the CMEC to response requirement of the time and spatial change, regulation or pathophysiological change.

"Ultrasound-mediated local drug and gene delivery using nanocarriers.","With the development of nanotechnology, nanocarriers have been increasingly used for curative drug/gene delivery. Various nanocarriers are being introduced and assessed, such as polymer nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles. As a novel theranostic system, nanocarriers hold great promise for ultrasound molecular imaging, targeted drug/gene delivery, and therapy. Nanocarriers, with the properties of smaller particle size, and long circulation time, would be advantageous in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Nanocarriers can pass through blood capillary walls and cell membrane walls to deliver drugs. The mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and nanocarriers are not clearly understood, which may be related to cavitation, mechanical effects, thermal effects, and so forth. These effects may induce transient membrane permeabilization (sonoporation) on a single cell level, cell death, and disruption of tissue structure, ensuring noninvasive, targeted, and efficient drug/gene delivery and therapy. The system has been used in various tissues and organs (in vitro or in vivo), including tumor tissues, kidney, cardiac, skeletal muscle, and vascular smooth muscle.

"Cardiac tissue slice transplantation as a model to assess tissue-engineered graft thickness, survival, and function.","BACKGROUND: Cell therapies offer the potential to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Although injection of single-cell suspensions has proven safe, cell retention and survival rates are low. Tissue-engineered grafts allow cell delivery with minimal initial cell loss and mechanical support to the heart. However, graft performance cannot be easily compared, and optimal construct thickness, vascularization, and survival kinetics are unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac tissue slices (CTS) were generated by sectioning mouse hearts (n=40) expressing firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein into slices of defined size and thickness using a vibrating blade microtome. Bioluminescence imaging of CTS transplanted onto hearts of immunodeficient mice demonstrated survival of ¡Ü30% of transplanted cells. Cardiac slice perfusion was re-established within 3 days, likely through anastomosis of pre-existing vessels with the host vasculature and invasion of vessels from the host. Immunofluorescence showed a peak in cell death 3 days after transplantation and a gradual decline thereafter. MRI revealed preservation of contractile function and an improved ejection fraction 1 month after transplantation of CTS (28¡À2% CTS versus 22¡À2% control; P=0.05). Importantly, this effect was specific to CTS because transplantation of skeletal muscle tissue slices led to faster dilative remodeling and higher animal mortality.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this is the first study to use CTS as a benchmark to validate and model tissue-engineered graft studies. CTS transplantation improved cell survival, established reperfusion, and enhanced cardiac function after myocardial infarction. These findings also confirm that dilative remodeling can be attenuated by topical transplantation of CTS but not skeletal muscle tissue grafts.","Circulation","25200059",2014,"Austria"
"Cytometric patterns reveal growth states of Shewanella putrefaciens.","Bacterial growth is often difficult to estimate beyond classical cultivation approaches. Low cell numbers, particles or coloured and dense media may disturb reliable growth assessment. Further difficulties appear when cells are attached to surfaces and detachment is incomplete. Therefore, flow cytometry was tested and used for analysis of bacterial growth on the single-cell level. Shewanella putrefaciens was cultivated as a model organism in planktonic or biofilm culture. Materials of smooth and rough surfaces were used for biofilm cultivation. Both aerobic and anaerobic as well as feast and famine conditions were applied. Visualization of growth was also done using Environmental Scanning and Phase Contrast Microscopy. Bioinformatic tools were applied for data interpretation. Cytometric proliferation patterns based on distributions of DNA contents per cell corresponded distinctly to the various lifestyles, electron acceptors and substrates tested. Therefore, cell cycling profiles of S.<U+2009>putrefaciens were found to mirror growth conditions. The cytometric patterns were consistently detectable with exception of some biofilm types whose resolution remained challenging. Corresponding heat maps proved to be useful for clear visualization of growth behaviour under all tested conditions. Therefore, flow cytometry in combination with bioinformatic tools proved to be powerful means to determine various growth states of S.<U+2009>putrefaciens, even in constrained environments. The approach is universal and will also be applicable for other bacterial species. ","Microbial biotechnology","25185955",2014,"United States"

"Early lineage restriction in temporally distinct populations of Mesp1 progenitors during mammalian heart development.","Cardiac development arises from two sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first heart field (FHF) and the second (SHF). Mesp1 has been proposed to mark the most primitive multipotent cardiac progenitors common for both heart fields. Here, using clonal analysis of the earliest prospective cardiovascular progenitors in a temporally controlled manner during early gastrulation, we found that Mesp1 progenitors consist of two temporally distinct pools of progenitors restricted to either the FHF or the SHF. FHF progenitors were unipotent, whereas SHF progenitors were either unipotent or bipotent. Microarray and single-cell PCR with reverse transcription analysis of Mesp1 progenitors revealed the existence of molecularly distinct populations of Mesp1 progenitors, consistent with their lineage and regional contribution. Together, these results provide evidence that heart development arises from distinct populations of unipotent and bipotent cardiac progenitors that independently express Mesp1 at different time points during their specification, revealing that the regional segregation and lineage restriction of cardiac progenitors occur very early during gastrulation.

"Stable, covalent attachment of laminin to microposts improves the contractility of mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes.","The mechanical output of contracting cardiomyocytes, the muscle cells of the heart, relates to healthy and disease states of the heart. Culturing cardiomyocytes on arrays of elastomeric microposts can enable inexpensive and high-throughput studies of heart disease at the single-cell level. However, cardiomyocytes weakly adhere to these microposts, which limits the possibility of using biomechanical assays of single cardiomyocytes to study heart disease. We hypothesized that a stable covalent attachment of laminin to the surface of microposts improves cardiomyocyte contractility. We cultured cells on polydimethylsiloxane microposts with laminin covalently bonded with the organosilanes 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane with glutaraldehyde. We measured displacement of microposts induced by the contractility of mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes, which attach better than mature cardiomyocytes to substrates. We observed time-dependent changes in contractile parameters such as micropost deformation, contractility rates, contraction and relaxation speeds, and the times of contractions. These parameters were affected by the density of laminin on microposts and by the stability of laminin binding to micropost surfaces. Organosilane-mediated binding resulted in higher laminin surface density and laminin binding stability. 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane provided the highest laminin density but did not provide stable protein binding with time. Higher surface protein binding stability and strength were observed with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane with glutaraldehyde. In cultured cardiomyocytes, contractility rate, contraction speeds, and contraction time increased with higher laminin stability. Given these variations in contractile function, we conclude that binding of laminin to microposts via 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane with glutaraldehyde improves contractility observed by an increase in beating rate and contraction speed as it occurs during the postnatal maturation of cardiomyocytes. This approach is promising for future studies to mimic in vivo tissue environments. ","ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces","25133578",2014,"United States"
"Dissemination of Orientia tsutsugamushi and inflammatory responses in a murine model of scrub typhus.","Central aspects in the pathogenesis of scrub typhus, an infection caused by Orientia (O.) tsutsugamushi, have remained obscure. Its organ and cellular tropism are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze the kinetics of bacterial dissemination and associated inflammatory responses in infected tissues in an experimental scrub typhus mouse model, following infection with the human pathogenic strain Karp. We provide a thorough analysis of O. tsutsugamushi infection in inbred Balb/c mice using footpad inoculation, which is close to the natural way of infection. By a novel, highly sensitive qPCR targeting the multi copy traD genes, we quantitatively monitored the spread of O. tsutsugamushi Karp from the skin inoculation site via the regional lymph node to the internal target organs. The highest bacterial loads were measured in the lung. Using confocal imaging, we also detected O. tsutsugamushi at the single cell level in the lung and found a predominant macrophage rather than endothelial localization. Immunohistochemical analysis of infiltrates in lung and brain revealed differently composed lesions with specific localizations: iNOS-expressing macrophages were frequent in infiltrative parenchymal noduli, but uncommon in perivascular lesions within these organs. Quantitative analysis of the macrophage response by immunohistochemistry in liver, heart, lung and brain demonstrated an early onset of macrophage activation in the liver. Serum levels of interferon (IFN)-¦Ã were increased during the acute infection, and we showed that IFN-¦Ã contributed to iNOS-dependent bacterial growth control. Our data show that upon inoculation to the skin, O. tsutsugamushi spreads systemically to a large number of organs and gives rise to organ-specific inflammation patterns. The findings suggest an essential role for the lung in the pathogenesis of scrub typhus. The model will allow detailed studies on host-pathogen interaction and provide further insight into the pathogenesis of O. tsutsugamushi infection.

"Pro-inflammatory T-lymphocytes rapidly infiltrate into the brain and contribute to neuronal injury following cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Although inflammatory mechanisms have been linked to neuronal injury following global cerebral ischemia, the presence of infiltrating peripheral immune cells remains understudied. We performed flow cytometry of single cell suspensions obtained from the brains of mice at varying time points after global cerebral ischemia induced by cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) to characterize the influx of lymphocytes into the injured brain. We observed that CA/CPR caused a large influx of lymphocytes within 3h of resuscitation that was maintained for the 3day duration of our experiments. Using cell staining flow cytometry we observed that the large majority of infiltrating lymphocytes were CD4(+) T cells. Intracellular stains revealed a large proportion of pro-inflammatory T cells expressing either TNF¦Á or INF¦Ã. Importantly, the lack of functional T cells in TCR¦Á knockout mice reduced neuronal injury following CA/CPR, implicating pro-inflammatory T cells in the progression of ischemic neuronal injury. Finally, we made the remarkable observation that the novel CD4(+)CD40(+) (Th40) population of pro-inflammatory T cells that are strongly associated with autoimmunity are present in large numbers in the injured brain. These data indicate that studies investigating the neuro-immune response after global cerebral ischemia should consider the role of infiltrating T cells in orchestrating the acute and sustained immune response.

The extract from the leaves of Serratula coronata was added to the water of animals of experimental groups 2 and 3 (n = 8 in each group) daily at the dose of 5 and 15 mg phytoecdysteroids per kg of body weight respectively. Animals of the control group 1 (n = 8) received water alone throughout the experiment. Daily volume of drunk fluid was recorded. At the 15th day of the experiment animals were taken out using the decapitation under the light ether anesthesia. The content of corticosterone, prostaglandin E2 and beta-endorphin in rat blood plasma were determined by ELISA test. Plasma level of noradrenaline was determined by HPLC. DNA damage and percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index) were measured in isolated cells of the thymus, heart and brain by single-cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay). Significantly lower concentration of norepinephrine was detected in plasma of experimental animals from groups 2 and 3 (10.3 +/- 1.1 and 7.2 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, respectively) compared to the same index in the control group (20.4 +/- 3.4 ng/ml). Significant differences of other biochemical parameters for all groups of animals have not been identified. Statistical significant difference in the ratio of corticosterone/norepinephrine compared with control animals was detected for a group of rats consumed the highest dose of phytoecdysteroids. There was no statistically significant difference in DNA fragmentation and apoptosis index in animals consumed phytoecdysteroids in compare with the control group of animals. The absence of the activity of apoptosis in cells of the heart, brain and thymus of rats treated with phytoecdysteroid extract may indicate the safety of its use in the diet of the animals.","Voprosy pitaniia","25059064",2014,"Russia (Federation)"

"From beat rate variability in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived pacemaker cells to heart rate variability in human subjects.","BACKGROUND: We previously reported that induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes manifest beat rate variability (BRV) resembling heart rate variability (HRV) in the human sinoatrial node. We now hypothesized the BRV-HRV continuum originates in pacemaker cells.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cellular BRV is a source of HRV dynamics, we hypothesized 3 levels of interaction among different cardiomyocyte entities: (1) single pacemaker cells, (2) networks of electrically coupled pacemaker cells, and (3) the in situ sinoatrial node.METHODS: We measured BRV/HRV properties in single pacemaker cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived contracting embryoid bodies (EBs), and electrocardiograms from the same individual.RESULTS: Pronounced BRV/HRV was present at all 3 levels. The coefficient of variance of interbeat intervals and Poincar¨¦ plot indices SD1 and SD2 for single cells were 20 times greater than those for EBs (P &lt; .05) and the in situ heart (the latter two were similar; P &gt; .05). We also compared BRV magnitude among single cells, small EBs (~5-10 cells), and larger EBs (&gt;10 cells): BRV indices progressively increased with the decrease in the cell number (P &lt; .05). Disrupting intracellular Ca(2+) handling markedly augmented BRV magnitude, revealing a unique bimodal firing pattern, suggesting that intracellular mechanisms contribute to BRV/HRV and the fractal behavior of heart rhythm.CONCLUSION: The decreased BRV magnitude in transitioning from the single cell to the EB suggests that the HRV of in situ hearts originates from the summation and integration of multiple cell-based oscillators. Hence, complex interactions among multiple pacemaker cells and intracellular Ca(2+) handling determine HRV in humans and cardiomyocyte networks.","Heart rhythm","25052725",2014,"United States"

Although resident stem cell populations have been identified to support cardiomyocyte turnover, the source of the cardiac stem cells and their niche remain elusive. Using Cre/Lox-based cell lineage tracing strategies, we discovered that labeling of endothelial cells in the adult heart yields progeny that have cardiac stem cell characteristics and express Gata4 and Sca1. Endothelial-derived cardiac progenitor cells were localized in the arterial coronary walls with quiescent and proliferative cells in the media and adventitia layers, respectively. Within the myocardium, we identified labeled cardiomyocytes organized in clusters of single-cell origin. Pulse-chase experiments showed that generation of individual clusters was rapid but confined to specific regions of the heart, primarily in the right anterior and left posterior ventricular walls and the junctions between the two ventricles.

"Load dependency in force-length relations in isolated single cardiomyocytes.","The previously reported pressure-volume (PV) relationship in frog hearts shows that end-systolic PV relation (ESPVR) is load dependent, whereas ESPVR in canine hearts is load independent. To study intrinsic cardiac mechanics in detail, it is desirable to study mechanics in a single isolated cardiomyocyte that is free from interstitial connective tissue. Previous single cell mechanics studies used a pair of carbon fibers (CF) attached to the upper surface of opposite cell ends to stretch cells. These studies showed that end-systolic force-length (FL) relation (ESFLR) is load independent. However, the range of applicable mechanical load using the conventional technique is limited because of weak cell-CF attachment. Therefore, the behavior of ESFLR in single cells under physiologically possible conditions of greater load is not yet well known. To cover wider loading range, we contrived a new method to hold cell-ends more firmly using two pairs of CF attached to both upper and bottom surfaces of cells. The new method allowed stretching cells to 2.2<U+00A0>¦Ìm or more in end-diastolic sarcomere length. ESFLR virtually behaves in a load independent manner only with end-diastolic sarcomere length less than 1.95<U+00A0>¦Ìm. It exhibited clear load dependency with higher preload, especially with low afterload conditions. Instantaneous cellular elastance curves showed that decreasing afterload enhanced relaxation and slowed time to peak elastance, as previously reported. A simulation study of a mathematical model with detailed description of thin filament activation suggested that velocity dependent thin filament inactivation is crucial for the observed load dependent behaviors and previously reported afterload dependent change in Ca(2+) transient shape.

"High-resolution traction force microscopy.","Cellular forces generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton and transmitted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through discrete, integrin-based protein assemblies, that is, focal adhesions, are critical to developmental morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis, as well as disease progression in cancer.

Here, we provide detailed protocols for measuring cellular forces exerted on two-dimensional elastic substrates with a high-resolution traction force microscopy (TFM) method. We describe fabrication of polyacrylamide substrates labeled with multiple colors of fiducial markers, functionalization of the substrates with ECM proteins, setting up the experiment, and imaging procedures. In addition, we provide the theoretical background of traction reconstruction and experimental considerations important to design a high-resolution TFM experiment. We describe the implementation of a new algorithm for processing of images of fiducial markers that are taken below the surface of the substrate, which significantly improves data quality. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm and explain how to choose a regularization parameter for suppression of the measurement error.

In contrast with prediction approaches that define enhancers based on histone marks or p300 sites from a single cell line, we trained EnhancerFinder on hundreds of experimentally verified human developmental enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser. We comprehensively evaluated EnhancerFinder using cross validation and found that our integrative method improves the identification of enhancers over approaches that consider a single type of data, such as sequence motifs, evolutionary conservation, or the binding of enhancer-associated proteins. We find that VISTA enhancers active in embryonic heart are easier to identify than enhancers active in several other embryonic tissues, likely due to their uniquely high GC content. We applied EnhancerFinder to the entire human genome and predicted 84,301 developmental enhancers and their tissue specificity. These predictions provide specific functional annotations for large amounts of human non-coding DNA, and are significantly enriched near genes with annotated roles in their predicted tissues and lead SNPs from genome-wide association studies. We demonstrate the utility of EnhancerFinder predictions through in vivo validation of novel embryonic gene regulatory enhancers from three developmental transcription factor loci. Our genome-wide developmental enhancer predictions are freely available as a UCSC Genome Browser track, which we hope will enable researchers to further investigate questions in developmental biology.

"A novel stretching platform for applications in cell and tissue mechanobiology.","Tools that allow the application of mechanical forces to cells and tissues or that can quantify the mechanical properties of biological tissues have contributed dramatically to the understanding of basic mechanobiology. These techniques have been extensively used to demonstrate how the onset and progression of various diseases are heavily influenced by mechanical cues. This article presents a multi-functional biaxial stretching (BAXS) platform that can either mechanically stimulate single cells or quantify the mechanical stiffness of tissues. The BAXS platform consists of four voice coil motors that can be controlled independently. Single cells can be cultured on a flexible substrate that can be attached to the motors allowing one to expose the cells to complex, dynamic, and spatially varying strain fields. Conversely, by incorporating a force load cell, one can also quantify the mechanical properties of primary tissues as they are exposed to deformation cycles. In both cases, a proper set of clamps must be designed and mounted to the BAXS platform motors in order to firmly hold the flexible substrate or the tissue of interest. The BAXS platform can be mounted on an inverted microscope to perform simultaneous transmitted light and/or fluorescence imaging to examine the structural or biochemical response of the sample during stretching experiments. This article provides experimental details of the design and usage of the BAXS platform and presents results for single cell and whole tissue studies. The BAXS platform was used to measure the deformation of nuclei in single mouse myoblast cells in response to substrate strain and to measure the stiffness of isolated mouse aortas. The BAXS platform is a versatile tool that can be combined with various optical microscopies in order to provide novel mechanobiological insights at the sub-cellular, cellular and whole tissue levels.

"Hypoxia induced DNA damage in children with isolated septal defect and septal defect with great vessel anomaly of heart.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: In Congenital Heart Disease (CHD), shunting of blood occurs through the anatomical defects which lead to mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Chronic hypoxia which occurs due to the above said mechanism has the potency to cause DNA damage in children with CHD. In chronic hypoxia, there is a liberation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) due to tissue injury as a result of ischemia and induction of hypoxia inducible factor - 1HIF-1 and p53 which in turn activates pro-apoptotic factors leading to alteration in the regulation of pro-apoptotic gene Blc-2 to be involved in causing the DNA damage. The extent of chronic hypoxia and the DNA damage depends on the nature of the anatomical heart defect. Hence, the present case-control study was conducted to find out the DNA damage in children with isolated septal defect and septal defect with great vessel anomaly of heart and to compare the same.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group was categorized into those with isolated septal defects and septal defects associated with great vessel anomaly based on echo-cardiogram. Age and sex matched healthy children were taken as controls. Single-cell gel electrophoresis - Comet Assay of Alkaline Version was performed conventionally and the comets were analyzed using comet score software.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The comet metrics was found to be statistically significant in children with isolated septal defect and septal defect with great vessel anomaly when compared with that of the controls. In addition, comet metrics also showed significantly increased DNA damage among children with septal defects associated with great vessel anomaly when compared to isolated septal defects. The data strongly suggests a linear correlation of severity of the anomaly involved with the degree of DNA damage as evidenced by lesser extent of DNA damage in isolated septal defect and greater in septal defect with great vessel anomaly.","Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","24959493",2014,"India"
"Sequential third-party mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.","We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the administration of 4 sequential doses (intravenously administered on days 1, 4, 11, and 18) of cryopreserved bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) expanded with platelet lysate and obtained from third-party donors as a second-line treatment for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host (aGVHD) disease in a series of 25 patients. All patients received at least 2 doses of MSC, whereas 21 received 3 doses and 18 received the initially planned 4 doses. Because of the achievement of partial response, 4 patients received additional doses of MSC. Median single cell dose administered was 1.1<U+00A0>¡Á<U+00A0>10(6) MSC/kg of recipient body weight. There were no adverse events related to the MSC infusion in the 99 procedures performed, with the exception of a cardiac ischemic event that occurred twice in a patient with prior history of cardiac ischemia. Response to MSC at 60<U+00A0>days after the first dose was evaluable in 24 patients. Seventeen patients (71%) responded (11 complete and 6 partial responses), with a median time to response of 28<U+00A0>days after the first MSC dose, whereas 7 patients did not respond. In summary, we can conclude that sequential cryopreserved third-party MSC therapy administered on days 1, 4, 11, and 18 is a safe procedure for patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD. This strategy may provide a high rate of overall responses of aGVHD with a low toxicity profile.

"Inhibition of apoptosis in human induced pluripotent stem cells during expansion in a defined culture using angiopoietin-1 derived peptide QHREDGS.","Adhesion molecule signaling is critical to human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) survival, self-renewal, and differentiation. Thus, hPSCs are grown as clumps of cells on feeder cell layers or poorly defined extracellular matrices such as Matrigel. We sought to define a small molecule that would initiate adhesion-based signaling to serve as a basis for a defined substrate for hPSC culture. Soluble angiopoeitin-1 (Ang-1)-derived peptide QHREDGS added to defined serum-free media increased hPSC colony cell number and size during long- and short-term culture when grown on feeder cell layers or Matrigel, i.e. on standard substrates, without affecting hPSC morphology, growth rate or the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages both in<U+00A0>vitro and in<U+00A0>vivo. Importantly, QHREDGS treatment decreased hPSC apoptosis during routine passaging and single-cell dissociation. Mechanistically, the interaction of QHREDGS with ¦Â1-integrins increased expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), increased expression and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), and decreased caspase-3/7 activity. QHREDGS immobilization to polyethylene glycol hydrogels significantly increased cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. We propose QHREDGS as a small molecule inhibitor of hPSC apoptosis and the basis of an affordable defined substrate for hPSC maintenance. ","Biomaterials","24930852",2014,"United States"
"Sca-1+ cardiac progenitor cells and heart-making: a critical synopsis.","The identification, in the adult, of cardiomyocyte turnover events and of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) has revolutionized the field of cardiovascular medicine. However, the low rate of CPCs differentiation events reported both in vitro and in vivo, even after injury, raised concerns on the biological significance of these subsets. In this Comprehensive Review, we discuss the current understanding of cardiac Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells in light of what is also known for cellular compartments with similar phenotypes in other organs. The Lin(-)Sca-1(+) heart subset is heterogeneous and displays a mesenchymal profile, characterized by a limited ability to generate cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo, even after injury. There is no evidence for Sca-1 expression in embryonic cardiovascular progenitors. In other organs, Sca-1 expression is mainly observed on mesoderm-derived cells, although it is not restricted to stem/progenitor cell populations. It is urgent to determine, at a single cell level, to which extent cardiac Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells overlap with the fibroblast compartment. ","Stem cells and development","24926741",2014,"United States"
"Epigenetic state network approach for describing cell phenotypic transitions.","Recent breakthroughs of cell phenotype reprogramming impose theoretical challenges on unravelling the complexity of large circuits maintaining cell phenotypes coupled at many different epigenetic and gene regulation levels, and quantitatively describing the phenotypic transition dynamics. A popular picture proposed by Waddington views cell differentiation as a ball sliding down a landscape with valleys corresponding to different cell types separated by ridges. Based on theories of dynamical systems, we establish a novel 'epigenetic state network' framework that captures the global architecture of cell phenotypes, which allows us to translate the metaphorical low-dimensional Waddington epigenetic landscape concept into a simple-yet-predictive rigorous mathematical framework of cell phenotypic transitions. Specifically, we simplify a high-dimensional epigenetic landscape into a collection of discrete states corresponding to stable cell phenotypes connected by optimal transition pathways among them. We then apply the approach to the phenotypic transition processes among fibroblasts (FBs), pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs). The epigenetic state network for this case predicts three major transition pathways connecting FBs and CMs. One goes by way of PSCs. The other two pathways involve transdifferentiation either indirectly through cardiac progenitor cells or directly from FB to CM. The predicted pathways and multiple intermediate states are supported by existing microarray data and other experiments. Our approach provides a theoretical framework for studying cell phenotypic transitions. Future studies at single-cell levels can directly test the model predictions.

"Stiffness of left ventricular cardiac fibroblasts is associated with ventricular dilation in patients with recent-onset nonischemic and nonvalvular cardiomyopathy.","BACKGROUND: Ventricular dilation is known as a pivotal predictor in recent-onset cardiomyopathy (ROCM), but its pathophysiology is not fully understood. In the present study we investigated whether single-cell stiffness of right and left ventricular-derived fibroblasts has an effect on cardiac phenotype in patients with ROCM.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with endomyocardial biopsy-proven ROCM were included (n=10). Primary cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) were cultured from left and right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies and their single-cell stiffness was analyzed by quantification of Young's modulus using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy. Cardiac fibrosis was analyzed by Masson's trichrome staining. CFBs from the left ventricle showed significantly decreased stiffness when compared with CFBs from the right ventricle, indexed by decreased stiffness (Young's modulus 3,374¡À389 vs. 4,837¡À690 Pa; P&lt;0.05). Young's modulus of CFBs derived from the left ventricle correlated negatively with the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension derived from 2-dimensional echocardiography (R(2)=0.77; P&lt;0.01). Neither left nor right ventricular fibrosis correlated with the respective ventricular dimensions.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a decrease in single-cell stiffness of left ventricular fibroblasts could trigger left ventricular dilation in patients with ROCM. This implies a new potential mechanism for the ventricular dilation with this disease.","Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society","24899232",2014,"Japan"
"NO, via its target Cx37, modulates calcium signal propagation selectively at myoendothelial gap junctions.","BACKGROUND: Gap junctional calcium signal propagation (transfer of calcium or a calcium releasing messenger via gap junctions) between vascular cells has been shown to be involved in the control of vascular tone. We have shown before that nitric oxide (NO) inhibits gap junctional communication in HeLa cells exclusively expressing connexin 37 (HeLa-Cx37) but not in HeLa-Cx40 or HeLa-Cx43. Here we studied the effect of NO on the gap junctional calcium signal propagation in endothelial cells which, in addition to Cx37, also express Cx40 and Cx43. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of NO on intermuscle and on myoendothelial gap junction-dependent calcium signal propagation. Since specific effects of NO at one of these three junctional areas (interendothelial/ myoendothelial/ intermuscle) may depend on a differential membrane localization of the connexins, we also studied the distribution of the vascular connexins in small resistance arteries.RESULTS: In endothelial (HUVEC) or smooth muscle cells (HUVSMC) alone, NO did not affect gap junctional Ca2+ signal propagation as assessed by analyzing the spread of Ca2+ signals after mechanical stimulation of a single cell. In contrast, at myoendothelial junctions, it decreased Ca2+ signal propagation in both directions by about 60% (co-cultures of HUVEC and HUVSMC). This resulted in a longer maintenance of calcium elevation at the endothelial side and a faster calcium signal propagation at the smooth muscle side, respectively. Immunohistochemical stainings (confocal and two-photon-microscopy) of cells in co-cultures or of small arteries revealed that Cx37 expression was relatively higher in endothelial cells adjoining smooth muscle (culture) or in potential areas of myoendothelial junctions (arteries). Accordingly, Cx37 - in contrast to Cx40 - was not only expressed on the endothelial surface of small arteries but also in deeper layers (corresponding to the internal elastic lamina IEL). Holes of the IEL where myoendothelial contacts can only occur, stained significantly more frequently for Cx37 and Cx43 than for Cx40 (endothelium) or Cx45 (smooth muscle).CONCLUSION: NO modulates the calcium signal propagation specifically between endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The effect is due to an augmented distribution of Cx37 towards myoendothelial contact areas and potentially counteracts endothelial Ca2+ signal loss from endothelial to smooth muscle cells. This targeted effect of NO may optimize calcium dependent endothelial vasomotor function.","Cell communication and signaling : CCS","24885166",2014,"England"
"HIP-55 negatively regulates myocardial contractility at the single-cell level.","Myocardial contractility is crucial for cardiac output and heart function. But the detailed mechanisms of regulation remain unclear. In the present study, we found that HIP-55, an actin binding protein, negatively regulates myocardial contractility at the single-cell level. HIP-55 was overexpressed and knocked down in cardiomyocytes with an adenovirus infection. The traction forces exerted by single cardiomyocyte were measured using cell traction force microscopy. The results showed that HIP-55 knockdown significantly increased the contractility of the cardiomyocytes and HIP-55 overexpression could markedly reverse this process. Furthermore, HIP-55 was obviously co-localized with F-actin in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that HIP-55 regulated cardiac contractile function through the interaction between HIP-55 and F-actin. This study reveals the regulatory mechanisms of myocardial contractility and provides a new target for preventing and treating cardiovascular disease.

"Isolation and functional characterization of human ventricular cardiomyocytes from fresh surgical samples.","Cardiomyocytes from diseased hearts are subjected to complex remodeling processes involving changes in cell structure, excitation contraction coupling and membrane ion currents. Those changes are likely to be responsible for the increased arrhythmogenic risk and the contractile alterations leading to systolic and diastolic dysfunction in cardiac patients. However, most information on the alterations of myocyte function in cardiac diseases has come from animal models. Here we describe and validate a protocol to isolate viable myocytes from small surgical samples of ventricular myocardium from patients undergoing cardiac surgery operations. The protocol is described in detail. Electrophysiological and intracellular calcium measurements are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of a number of single cell measurements in human ventricular cardiomyocytes obtained with this method. The protocol reported here can be useful for future investigations of the cellular and molecular basis of functional alterations of the human heart in the presence of different cardiac diseases. Further, this method can be used to identify novel therapeutic targets at cellular level and to test the effectiveness of new compounds on human cardiomyocytes, with direct translational value.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","24798397",2014,"Italy"
"A module of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptional network containing primitive and differentiation markers is related to specific cardiovascular health variables.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including rare circulating stem and progenitor cells (CSPCs), have important yet poorly understood roles in the maintenance and repair of blood vessels and perfused organs. Our hypothesis was that the identities and functions of CSPCs in cardiovascular health could be ascertained by analyzing the patterns of their co-expressed markers in unselected PBMC samples. Because gene microarrays had failed to detect many stem cell-associated genes, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the expression of 45 primitive and tissue differentiation markers in PBMCs from healthy and hypertensive human subjects. We compared these expression levels to the subjects' demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, including vascular stiffness. The tested marker genes were expressed in all of samples and organized in hierarchical transcriptional network modules, constructed by a bottom-up approach. An index of gene expression in one of these modules (metagene), defined as the average standardized relative copy numbers of 15 pluripotency and cardiovascular differentiation markers, was negatively correlated (all p&lt;0.03) with age (R2<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.23), vascular stiffness (R2<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.24), and central aortic pressure (R2<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.19) and positively correlated with body mass index (R2<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.72, in women). The co-expression of three neovascular markers was validated at the single-cell level using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The overall gene expression in this cardiovascular module was reduced by 72¡À22% in the patients compared with controls. However, the compactness of both modules was increased in the patients' samples, which was reflected in reduced dispersion of their nodes' degrees of connectivity, suggesting a more primitive character of the patients' CSPCs. In conclusion, our results show that the relationship between CSPCs and vascular function is encoded in modules of the PBMCs transcriptional network. Furthermore, the coordinated gene expression in these modules can be linked to cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease; thus, this measure may be useful for their diagnosis and prognosis.

"Study of flow behaviors on single-cell manipulation and shear stress reduction in microfluidic chips using computational fluid dynamics simulations.","Various single-cell retention structures (SCRSs) were reported for analysis of single cells within microfluidic devices. Undesirable flow behaviors within micro-environments not only influence single-cell manipulation and retention significantly but also lead to cell damage, biochemical heterogeneity among different individual cells (e.g., different cell signaling pathways induced by shear stress). However, the fundamentals in flow behaviors for single-cell manipulation and shear stress reduction, especially comparison of these behaviors in different microstructures, were not fully investigated in previous reports. Herein, flow distribution and induced shear stress in two different single-cell retention structures (SCRS I and SCRS II) were investigated in detail to study their effects on single-cell trapping using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. The results were successfully verified by experimental results. Comparison between these two SCRS shows that the wasp-waisted configuration of SCRS II has a better performance in trapping and manipulating long cylinder-shaped cardiac myocytes and provides a safer &quot;harbor&quot; for fragile cells to prevent cell damage due to the shear stress induced from strong flows. The simulation results have not only explained flow phenomena observed in experiments but also predict new flow phenomena, providing guidelines for new chip design and optimization, and a better understanding of the cell micro-environment and fundamentals of microfluidic flows in single-cell manipulation and analysis.

Temporal STV of field potential duration (FPD) showed a potential to predict the risks of lethal arrhythmia originated from repolarization dispersion for false negative compounds, which was not correctly predicted by conventional measurements using animal cells, even for non-QT prolonging clinical positive compounds. Spatial STV of conduction time delay also unveiled the proarrhythmic risk of asynchronous propagation in cell networks, whose risk cannot be correctly predicted by single-cell-based measurements, indicating the importance of the spatiotemporal fluctuation viewpoint of in vitro cell networks for precise prediction of lethal arrhythmia reaching clinical assessment such as thorough QT assay.

The analysis of the beating behavior of single cardiomyocytes, especially ones derived from stem cells, is challenging but well warranted. In this study, a video-based method that is non-invasive and label-free is introduced and applied for the study of single human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.METHODS: The beating of dissociated stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes was visualized with a microscope and the motion was video-recorded. Minimum quadratic difference, a digital image correlation method, was used for beating analysis with geometrical sectorial cell division and radial/tangential directions. The time series of the temporal displacement vector fields of a single cardiomyocyte was computed from video data. The vector field data was processed to obtain cell-specific, contraction-relaxation dynamics signals. Simulated cardiomyocyte beating was used as a reference and the current clamp of real cardiomyocytes was used to analyze the electrical functionality of the beating cardiomyocytes.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that our sectorized image correlation method is capable of extracting single cell beating characteristics from the video data of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes that have no clear movement axis, and that the method can accurately identify beating phases and time parameters.CONCLUSION: Our video analysis of the beating motion of single human cardiomyocytes provides a robust, non-invasive and label-free method to analyze the mechanobiological functionality of cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.

"Visualizing protein-DNA interactions in live bacterial cells using photoactivated single-molecule tracking.","Protein-DNA interactions are at the heart of many fundamental cellular processes.

We recently introduced a method for quantifying DNA-repair activities in live Escherichia coli cells using Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) combined with single-molecule tracking. Our general approach identifies individual DNA-binding events by the change in the mobility of a single protein upon association with the chromosome.

"Adhesion molecule expression and function of primary endothelial cells in benign and malignant tissues correlates with proliferation.","BACKGROUND: Comparative analysis of the cellular biology of the microvasculature in different tissues requires the availability of viable primary endothelial cells (ECs). This study describes a novel method to isolate primary ECs from healthy organs, repair blastemas and tumors as examples of non-proliferating and proliferating benign and malignant tissues and their functional characterization.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Single cell suspensions from hearts, lungs, repair blastemas and tumors were incubated consecutively with an anti-CD31 antibody and magnetic micro-beads, coupled to a derivative of biotin and streptavidin, respectively. Following magnetic bead separation, CD31-positive ECs were released by biotin-streptavidin competition. In the absence of micro-beads, ECs became adherent to plastic surfaces. ECs from proliferating repair blastemas and tumors were larger and exhibited higher expression densities of CD31, CD105 and CD102 compared to those from non-proliferating normal tissues such as heart and lung. The expression density of CD34 was particularly high in tumor-derived ECs, and that of CD54 and CD144 in ECs of repair blastemas. Functionally, ECs of non-proliferating and proliferating tissues differed in their capacity to form tubes in matrigel and to align under flow conditions.SIGNIFICANCE: This method provides a powerful tool to generate high yields of viable, primary ECs of different origins. The results suggest that an altered expression of adhesion molecules on ECs in proliferating tissues contribute to loss of EC function that might cause a chaotic tumor vasculature.","PloS one","24632811",2014,"United States"
"Defined 2-D microtissues on soft elastomeric silicone rubber using lift-off epoxy-membranes for biomechanical analyses.","Surface patterning with complex molecules has become a valuable tool in cell biology and biotechnology, as it enables one to control cell shape and function in culture. However, this technique for micro-contact printing is normally performed on rigid substrates, e.g. Petri dishes or glass. Despite the fact that these substrates can easily be patterned they are artificially stiff environments for cells affecting their morphology and function. Those artifacts can be avoided on tissue elasticity resembling substrates, leading to a nature like cell morphology and behavior. However, reproducible patterning of very soft elastomeric substrates is challenging. Here, we describe a simple and highly accurate method through cavities of lift-off membranes for protein patterning of silicone rubber substrates in an elasticity range down to 1.5 kPa without altering their mechanical properties. Membranes are made of epoxy resin with feature sizes that can be chosen almost arbitrarily including widths down to 5 ¦Ìm and aspect ratios of 100 and more. Different feature shapes were used to actively manipulate cell adhesion, cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton on soft substrates. Manipulation of cytoskeletal organization furthermore allowed the comparison of myofibril alignment and cellular forces of cardiac myocytes. These data could show that cell forces are largely unaffected upon active disordering of overall myofibril alignment on a single cell level while aligned multicellular systems generate cell forces in an additive manner.

"Measuring the contractile forces of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with arrays of microposts.","Human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes hold promise for heart repair, disease modeling, drug screening, and for studies of developmental biology. All of these applications can be improved by assessing the contractility of cardiomyocytes at the single cell level. We have developed an in vitro platform for assessing the contractile performance of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes that is compatible with other common endpoints such as microscopy and molecular biology. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were seeded onto elastomeric micropost arrays in order to characterize the contractile force, velocity, and power produced by these cells. We assessed contractile function by tracking the deflection of microposts beneath an individual hiPSC-CM with optical microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining of these cells was employed to assess their spread area, nucleation, and sarcomeric structure on the microposts. Following seeding of hiPSC-CMs onto microposts coated with fibronectin, laminin, and collagen IV, we found that hiPSC-CMs on laminin coatings demonstrated higher attachment, spread area, and contractile velocity than those seeded on fibronectin or collagen IV coatings. Under optimized conditions, hiPSC-CMs spread to an area of approximately 420<U+2009>¦Ìm2, generated systolic forces of approximately 15 nN/cell, showed contraction and relaxation rates of 1.74<U+2009>¦Ìm/s and 1.46<U+2009>¦Ìm/s, respectively, and had a peak contraction power of 29 fW. Thus, elastomeric micropost arrays can be used to study the contractile strength and kinetics of hiPSC-CMs. This system should facilitate studies of hiPSC-CM maturation, disease modeling, and drug screens as well as fundamental studies of human cardiac contraction.

"A microstructural model of reentry arising from focal breakthrough at sites of source-load mismatch in a central region of slow conduction.","Regions of cardiac tissue that have a combination of focal activity and poor, heterogeneous gap junction coupling are often considered to be arrhythmogenic; however, the relationship between the properties of the cardiac microstructure and patterns of abnormal propagation is not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of microstructure on the initiation of reentry from focal stimulation inside a poorly coupled region embedded in more well-coupled tissue. Two-dimensional discrete computer models of ventricular monolayers (1 ¡Á 1 cm) were randomly generated to represent heterogeneity in the cardiac microstructure. A small, central poorly coupled patch (0.40 ¡Á 0.40 cm) was introduced to represent the site of focal activity. Simulated unipolar electrogram recordings were computed at various points in the tissue. As the gap conductance of the patch decreased, conduction slowed and became increasingly complex, marked by fractionated electrograms with reduced amplitude. Near the limit of conduction block, isolated breakthrough sites occurred at single cells along the patch boundary and were marked by long cell-to-cell delays and negative deflections on electrogram recordings. The strongest determinant of the site of wavefront breakthrough was the connectivity of the brick wall architecture, which enabled current flow through small regions of overlapping cells to drive propagation into the well-coupled zone. In conclusion, breakthroughs at the size scale of a single cell can occur at the boundary of source-load mismatch allowing focal activations from slow conducting regions to produce reentry. These breakthrough regions, identifiable by distinct asymmetric, reduced amplitude electrograms, are sensitive to tissue architecture and may be targets for ablation.

"Influenza a virus assembly intermediates fuse in the cytoplasm.","Reassortment of influenza viral RNA (vRNA) segments in co-infected cells can lead to the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential. Replication of influenza vRNA occurs in the nucleus of infected cells, while progeny virions bud from the plasma membrane. However, the intracellular mechanics of vRNA assembly into progeny virions is not well understood. Here we used recent advances in microscopy to explore vRNA assembly and transport during a productive infection. We visualized four distinct vRNA segments within a single cell using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and observed that foci containing more than one vRNA segment were found at the external nuclear periphery, suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported to the cytoplasm individually. Although many cytoplasmic foci contain multiple vRNA segments, not all vRNA species are present in every focus, indicating that assembly of all eight vRNA segments does not occur prior to export from the nucleus. To extend the observations made in fixed cells, we used a virus that encodes GFP fused to the viral polymerase acidic (PA) protein (WSN PA-GFP) to explore the dynamics of vRNA assembly in live cells during a productive infection. Since WSN PA-GFP colocalizes with viral nucleoprotein and influenza vRNA segments, we used it as a surrogate for visualizing vRNA transport in 3D and at high speed by inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy. We observed cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing and traveling together en route to the plasma membrane. Our data strongly support a model in which vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus as complexes that assemble en route to the plasma membrane through dynamic colocalization events in the cytoplasm.

"Loss of myoferlin redirects breast cancer cell motility towards collective migration.","Cell migration plays a central role in the invasion and metastasis of tumors. As cells leave the primary tumor, they undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate as single cells. Epithelial tumor cells may also migrate in a highly directional manner as a collective group in some settings. We previously discovered that myoferlin (MYOF) is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and depletion of MYOF results in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and reduced invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the biomechanical mechanisms governing cell motility during MYOF depletion are poorly understood. We first demonstrated that lentivirus-driven shRNA-induced MYOF loss in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA-231(MYOF-KD)) leads to an epithelial morphology compared to the mesenchymal morphology observed in control (MDA-231(LTVC)) and wild-type cells. Knockdown of MYOF led to significant reductions in cell migration velocity and MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells migrated directionally and collectively, while MDA-231(LTVC) cells exhibited single cell migration. Decreased migration velocity and collective migration were accompanied by significant changes in cell mechanics. MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells exhibited a 2-fold decrease in cell stiffness, a 2-fold increase in cell-substrate adhesion and a 1.5-fold decrease in traction force generation. In vivo studies demonstrated that when immunocompromised mice were implanted with MDA-231(MYOF-KD) cells, tumors were smaller and demonstrated lower tumor burden. Moreover, MDA-231(MYOF-KD) tumors were highly circularized and did not invade locally into the adventia in contrast to MDA-231(LTVC)-injected animals. Thus MYOF loss is associated with a change in tumor formation in xenografts and leads to smaller, less invasive tumors. These data indicate that MYOF, a previously unrecognized protein in cancer, is involved in MDA-MB-231 cell migration and contributes to biomechanical alterations. Our results indicate that changes in biomechanical properties following loss of this protein may be an effective way to alter the invasive capacity of cancer cells.","PloS one","24586247",2014,"United States"

"Machine learning classification of cell-specific cardiac enhancers uncovers developmental subnetworks regulating progenitor cell division and cell fate specification.","The Drosophila heart is composed of two distinct cell types, the contractile cardial cells (CCs) and the surrounding non-muscle pericardial cells (PCs), development of which is regulated by a network of conserved signaling molecules and transcription factors (TFs). Here, we used machine learning with array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data and TF sequence motifs to computationally classify cell type-specific cardiac enhancers. Extensive testing of predicted enhancers at single-cell resolution revealed the added value of ChIP data for modeling cell type-specific activities. Furthermore, clustering the top-scoring classifier sequence features identified novel cardiac and cell type-specific regulatory motifs. For example, we found that the Myb motif learned by the classifier is crucial for CC activity, and the Myb TF acts in concert with two forkhead domain TFs and Polo kinase to regulate cardiac progenitor cell divisions. In addition, differential motif enrichment and cis-trans genetic studies revealed that the Notch signaling pathway TF Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] discriminates PC from CC enhancer activities. Collectively, these studies elucidate molecular pathways used in the regulatory decisions for proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, implicate Su(H) in regulating cell fate decisions of these progenitors, and document the utility of enhancer modeling in uncovering developmental regulatory subnetworks.

"Contractile dysfunction in a mouse model expressing a heterozygous MYBPC3 mutation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","The etiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been ascribed to mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. In particular, mutations in MYBPC3, a gene which encodes cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C), have been implicated in over one third of HCM cases. Of these mutations, 70% are predicted to result in C'-truncated protein products, which are undetectable in tissue samples. Heterozygous carriers of these truncation mutations exhibit varying penetrance of HCM, with symptoms often occurring later in life. We hypothesize that heterozygous carriers of MYBPC3 mutations, while seemingly asymptomatic, have subtle functional impairments that precede the development of overt HCM. This study compared heterozygous (+/t) knock-in MYBPC3 truncation mutation mice with wild-type (+/+) littermates to determine whether functional alterations occur at the whole-heart or single-cell level before the onset of hypertrophy. The +/t mice show ¡«40% reduction in MYBPC3 transcription, but no changes in cMyBP-C level, phosphorylation status, or cardiac morphology. Nonetheless, +/t mice show significantly decreased maximal force development at sarcomere lengths of 1.9 ¦Ìm (+/t 68.5 ¡À 4.1 mN/mm(2) vs. +/+ 82.2 ¡À 3.2) and 2.3 ¦Ìm (+/t 79.2 ¡À 3.1 mN/mm(2) vs. +/+ 95.5 ¡À 2.4).

"Single cell stochastic regulation of pilus phase variation by an attenuation-like mechanism.","The molecular triggers leading to virulence of a number of human-adapted commensal bacteria such as Streptococcus gallolyticus are largely unknown. This opportunistic pathogen is responsible for endocarditis in the elderly and associated with colorectal cancer. Colonization of damaged host tissues with exposed collagen, such as cardiac valves and pre-cancerous polyps, is mediated by appendages referred to as Pil1 pili. Populations of S. gallolyticus are heterogeneous with the majority of cells weakly piliated while a smaller fraction is hyper piliated. We provide genetic evidences that heterogeneous pil1 expression depends on a phase variation mechanism involving addition/deletion of GCAGA repeats that modifies the length of an upstream leader peptide. Synthesis of longer leader peptides potentiates the transcription of the pil1 genes through ribosome-induced destabilization of a premature stem-loop transcription terminator. This study describes, at the molecular level, a new regulatory mechanism combining phase variation in a leader peptide-encoding gene and transcription attenuation. This simple and robust mechanism controls a stochastic heterogeneous pilus expression, which is important for evading the host immune system while ensuring optimal tissue colonization.

"A study of early afterdepolarizations in a model for human ventricular tissue.","Sudden cardiac death is often caused by cardiac arrhythmias. Recently, special attention has been given to a certain arrhythmogenic condition, the long-QT syndrome, which occurs as a result of genetic mutations or drug toxicity. The underlying mechanisms of arrhythmias, caused by the long-QT syndrome, are not fully understood. However, arrhythmias are often connected to special excitations of cardiac cells, called early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are depolarizations during the repolarizing phase of the action potential. So far, EADs have been studied mainly in isolated cardiac cells. However, the question on how EADs at the single-cell level can result in fibrillation at the tissue level, especially in human cell models, has not been widely studied yet. In this paper, we study wave patterns that result from single-cell EAD dynamics in a mathematical model for human ventricular cardiac tissue. We induce EADs by modeling experimental conditions which have been shown to evoke EADs at a single-cell level: by an increase of L-type Ca currents and a decrease of the delayed rectifier potassium currents. We show that, at the tissue level and depending on these parameters, three types of abnormal wave patterns emerge. We classify them into two types of spiral fibrillation and one type of oscillatory dynamics. Moreover, we find that the emergent wave patterns can be driven by calcium or sodium currents and we find phase waves in the oscillatory excitation regime. From our simulations we predict that arrhythmias caused by EADs can occur during normal wave propagation and do not require tissue heterogeneities. Experimental verification of our results is possible for experiments at the cell-culture level, where EADs can be induced by an increase of the L-type calcium conductance and by the application of I[Formula: see text] blockers, and the properties of the emergent patterns can be studied by optical mapping of the voltage and calcium.

"Cardiogenic and myogenic gene expression in mesenchymal stem cells after 5-azacytidine treatment.","OBJECTIVE: 5-Azacytidine is a hypomethylating agent that is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. This histone modifier is widely employed and plays a nonspecific role in influencing the differentiation capability of stem cells. The ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into cardiomyocyte- and myocyte-like cells after exposure to 3 different doses of 5-azacytidine has been evaluated and compared. The aim of the study was to optimize the effective dose of 5-azacytidine for promoting the cardiomyocyte and myocyte differentiation capabilities of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human bone marrow aspirations were collected from healthy donors. MSCs were used for the study of mesodermal differentiation. MSCs were cultured to promote osteoblast differentiation and adipocyte differentiation. The evaluation of osteogenic or adipogenic properties was then performed through immunocytochemical staining. BMMSCs were trypsinized into single-cell suspensions and then prepared for flow cytometric analysis. The MSCs were treated with 5, 10, or 15 ¦ÌM 5-azacytidine for 24 h and then cultured for 3 weeks. Total RNA was extracted from untreated and 5-azacytidine-treated cells. Troponin T and GATA4 antibodies were used as cardiogenic markers, whereas myogenin and MyoD antibodies were used as myocyte markers.RESULTS: The morphology and growth rate of MSCs that were treated with any of the 3 doses of 5-azacytidine were similar to the morphology and growth rate of control MSCs. An immunofluorescence analysis examining the expression of the cardiac-specific markers GATA4 and troponin T and the skeletal muscle-specific markers MyoD and myogenin revealed that cells treated with 15 ¦ÌM 5-azacytidine were strongly positive for these markers. Real-time RT-PCR results were examined; these amplifications indicated that there were higher expression levels of cardiac- and skeletal muscle-specific mRNAs in MSCs treated with 15 ¦Ìm 5-azacytidine than in MSCs that had either been treated with lower doses of 5-azacytidine or left untreated.CONCLUSION: MSCs treated with 5-azacytidine demonstrated the capacity to differentiate into both cardiomyocytes and skeletal myocytes, and 15 ¦ÌM 5-azacytidine could be the optimal dose of this drug. Other promoting factors should be examined to investigate the possibility of promoting the differentiation of MSCs into specific cell types.CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None declared.","Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology","24385773",2014,"Turkey"

The method is first illustrated and validated on simulated images of a fluorescently-labeled protein translocating from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and then applied to experimental data obtained with fluorescently-labeled hexokinase 2 in different cell types imaged by regular or confocal microscopy. The method was found to be robust with respect to cell morphology changes and mitochondrial dynamics (fusion, fission, movement) during the time-lapse imaging. Its ease of implementation should facilitate its application to a broad spectrum of time-lapse imaging studies. ","PloS one","24376509",2014,"United States"
"Utilization and control of bioactuators across multiple length scales.","In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the emerging field of bioactuators across a multitude of length scales. First, we discuss the use and control of biomolecules as nanoscale actuators. Molecular motors, such as DNA, kinesin, myosin, and F1-ATPase, have been shown to exert forces in the range between 1 pN to 45 pN. Second, we discuss the use and control of single and small clusters of cells to power microscale devices. Microorganisms, such as flagellated bacteria, protozoa, and algae, can naturally swim at speeds between 20 ¦Ìm s(-1) to 2 mm s(-1) and produce thrust forces between 0.3 pN to 200 pN. Individual and clustered mammalian cells, such as cardiac and skeletal cells, can produce even higher contractile forces between 80 nN to 3.5 ¦ÌN. Finally, we discuss the use and control of 2D- and 3D-assembled muscle tissues and muscle tissue explants as bioactuators to power devices. Depending on the size, composition, and organization of these hierarchical tissue constructs, contractile forces have been demonstrated to produce between 25 ¦ÌN to 1.18 mN.

We have previously identified human cardiac C-kit+CD45- cells, but only found evidence of endothelial commitment. A small cardiac committed subpopulation within the C-kit+CD45- population might however be present. To investigate this at single-cell level, right and left atrial biopsies were dissociated and analyzed by FACS. Only right atrial biopsies contained a clearly distinguishable C-kit+CD45- population, which was single-cell sorted for qPCR. A minor portion of the sorted cells (1.1%) expressed early cardiac gene NKX2.5 while most of the cells (81%) expressed late endothelial gene VWF. VWF- cells were analyzed for a wider panel of genes. One group of these cells expressed endothelial genes (FLK-1, CD31) while another group expressed late cardiac genes (TNNT2, ACTC1). In conclusion, human C-kit+CD45- cells were predominantly localized to the right atrium. While most of these cells expressed endothelial genes, a minor portion expressed cardiac genes.

"Electrophysiological properties of rostral ventrolateral medulla presympathetic neurons modulated by the respiratory network in rats.","The respiratory pattern generator modulates the sympathetic outflow, the strength of which is enhanced by challenges produced by hypoxia. This coupling is due to the respiratory-modulated presympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), but the underlining electrophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. For a better understanding of the neural substrates responsible for generation of this respiratory-sympathetic coupling, we combined immunofluorescence, single cell qRT-pCR, and electrophysiological recordings of the RVLM presympathetic neurons in in situ preparations from normal rats and rats submitted to a metabolic challenge produced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Our results show that the spinally projected cathecholaminergic C1 and non-C1 respiratory-modulated RVLM presympathetic neurons constitute a heterogeneous neuronal population regarding the intrinsic electrophysiological properties, respiratory synaptic inputs, and expression of ionic currents, albeit all neurons presented persistent sodium current-dependent intrinsic pacemaker properties after synaptic blockade. A specific subpopulation of non-C1 respiratory-modulated RVLM presympathetic neurons presented enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs from the respiratory network after CIH. This phenomenon may contribute to the increased sympathetic activity observed in CIH rats. We conclude that the different respiratory-modulated RVLM presympathetic neurons contribute to the central generation of respiratory-sympathetic coupling as part of a complex neuronal network, which in response to the challenges produced by CIH contribute to respiratory-related increase in the sympathetic activity.

"Pericellular Ca(2+) recycling potentiates thrombin-evoked Ca(2+) signals in human platelets.","We have previously demonstrated that Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCXs) potentiate Ca(2+) signaling evoked by thapsigargin in human platelets, via their ability to modulate the secretion of autocoids from dense granules. This link was confirmed in platelets stimulated with the physiological agonist, thrombin, and experiments were performed to examine how Ca(2+) removal by the NCX modulates platelet dense granule secretion. In cells loaded with the near-membrane indicator FFP-18, thrombin stimulation was observed to elicit an NCX-dependent accumulation of Ca(2+) in a pericellular region around the platelets. To test whether this pericellular Ca(2+) accumulation might be responsible for the influence of NCXs over platelet function, platelets were exposed to fast Ca(2+) chelators or had their glycocalyx removed. Both manipulations of the pericellular Ca(2+) rise reduced thrombin-evoked Ca(2+) signals and dense granule secretion. Blocking Ca(2+)-permeable ion channels had a similar effect, suggesting that Ca(2+) exported into the pericellular region is able to recycle back into the platelet cytosol. Single cell imaging with extracellular Fluo-4 indicated that thrombin-evoked rises in extracellular [Ca(2+)] occurred within the boundary described by the cell surface, suggesting their presence within the open canalicular system (OCS). FFP-18 fluorescence was similarly distributed. These data suggest that upon thrombin stimulation, NCX activity creates a rise in [Ca(2+)] within the pericellular region of the platelet from where it recycles back into the platelet cytosol, acting to both accelerate dense granule secretion and maintain the initial rise in cytosolic [Ca(2+)].

"Action potential duration heterogeneity of cardiac tissue can be evaluated from cell properties using Gaussian Green's function approach.","Action potential duration (APD) heterogeneity of cardiac tissue is one of the most important factors underlying initiation of deadly cardiac arrhythmias. In many cases such heterogeneity can be measured at tissue level only, while it originates from differences between the individual cardiac cells. The extent of heterogeneity at tissue and single cell level can differ substantially and in many cases it is important to know the relation between them. Here we study effects from cell coupling on APD heterogeneity in cardiac tissue in numerical simulations using the ionic TP06 model for human cardiac tissue. We show that the effect of cell coupling on APD heterogeneity can be described mathematically using a Gaussian Green's function approach. This relates the problem of electrotonic interactions to a wide range of classical problems in physics, chemistry and biology, for which robust methods exist. We show that, both for determining effects of tissue heterogeneity from cell heterogeneity (forward problem) as well as for determining cell properties from tissue level measurements (inverse problem), this approach is promising.

"Limb compression induces multi-system genetic damage in rats.","Muscle crush injury is a common trauma in the modern society after as a result of mass disasters after penetration into muscle by high-velocity projectiles, blunt external trauma, or by gravity during prolonged immobilization in comatose patients after head trauma, alcoholic or drug overdose. However, the underlying mechanisms linking these alterations are still not fully understood, especially in acute phase. The aim of this study was to analyze genomic instability in multiple organs of rats after acute muscle injury by means of single cell gel (comet) assay. Rats were randomly distributed into three groups (n=6 each group): control group and experimental groups: sacrificed 6h as 12h after muscle compression. These results indicate genetic damage in peripheral blood cells as depicted by tail moment results. DNA breakage was also detected in liver, lung and kidney cells after acute muscle injury for two times evaluated. Heart cells showed genetic damage after 12h following muscle compression. Taken together, our results suggest that acute muscle injury induces genomic damage in multiple organs of Wistar rats.

"Essential role of the m2R-RGS6-IKACh pathway in controlling intrinsic heart rate variability.","Normal heart function requires generation of a regular rhythm by sinoatrial pacemaker cells and the alteration of this spontaneous heart rate by the autonomic input to match physiological demand. However, the molecular mechanisms that ensure consistent periodicity of cardiac contractions and fine tuning of this process by autonomic system are not completely understood. Here we examined the contribution of the m2R-I(KACh) intracellular signaling pathway, which mediates the negative chronotropic effect of parasympathetic stimulation, to the regulation of the cardiac pacemaking rhythm. Using isolated heart preparations and single-cell recordings we show that the m2R-I(KACh) signaling pathway controls the excitability and firing pattern of the sinoatrial cardiomyocytes and determines variability of cardiac rhythm in a manner independent from the autonomic input. Ablation of the major regulator of this pathway, Rgs6, in mice results in irregular cardiac rhythmicity and increases susceptibility to atrial fibrillation. We further identify several human subjects with variants in the RGS6 gene and show that the loss of function in RGS6 correlates with increased heart rate variability. These findings identify the essential role of the m2R-I(KACh) signaling pathway in the regulation of cardiac sinus rhythm and implicate RGS6 in arrhythmia pathogenesis.","PloS one","24204714",2013,"United States"

"Altered cardiac electrophysiology and SUDEP in a model of Dravet syndrome.","OBJECTIVE: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of intractable pediatric epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP: Sudden Unexpected Death in epilepsy. Cardiac arrhythmias are a proposed cause for some cases of SUDEP, yet the susceptibility and potential mechanism of arrhythmogenesis in Dravet syndrome remain unknown. The majority of Dravet syndrome patients have de novo mutations in SCN1A, resulting in haploinsufficiency. We propose that, in addition to neuronal hyperexcitability, SCN1A haploinsufficiency alters cardiac electrical function and produces arrhythmias, providing a potential mechanism for SUDEP.METHODS: Postnatal day 15-21 heterozygous SCN1A-R1407X knock-in mice, expressing a human Dravet syndrome mutation, were used to investigate a possible cardiac phenotype. A combination of single cell electrophysiology and in vivo electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were performed.RESULTS: We observed a 2-fold increase in both transient and persistent Na(+) current density in isolated Dravet syndrome ventricular myocytes that resulted from increased activity of a tetrodotoxin-resistant Na(+) current, likely Nav1.5. Dravet syndrome myocytes exhibited increased excitability, action potential duration prolongation, and triggered activity. Continuous radiotelemetric ECG recordings showed QT prolongation, ventricular ectopic foci, idioventricular rhythms, beat-to-beat variability, ventricular fibrillation, and focal bradycardia. Spontaneous deaths were recorded in 2 DS mice, and a third became moribund and required euthanasia.INTERPRETATION: These data from single cell and whole animal experiments suggest that altered cardiac electrical function in Dravet syndrome may contribute to the susceptibility for arrhythmogenesis and SUDEP. These mechanistic insights may lead to critical risk assessment and intervention in human patients.","PloS one","24155976",2013,"United States"

This is particularly evident with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs): microenvironmental heterogeneity limits hPSC cell fate control. We developed a high-throughput platform to screen hPSCs in configurable microenvironments in which we optimized colony size, cell density and other parameters to achieve rapid and robust cell fate responses to exogenous cues. We used this platform to perform single-cell protein expression profiling, revealing that Oct4 and Sox2 costaining discriminates pluripotent, neuroectoderm, primitive streak and extraembryonic cell fates. We applied this Oct4-Sox2 code to analyze dose responses of 27 developmental factors to obtain lineage-specific concentration optima and to quantify cell line-specific endogenous signaling pathway activation and differentiation bias. We demonstrated that short-term responses predict definitive endoderm induction efficiency and can be used to rescue differentiation of cell lines reticent to cardiac induction.

"Robust pluripotent stem cell expansion and cardiomyocyte differentiation via geometric patterning.","Geometric factors including the size, shape, density, and spacing of pluripotent stem cell colonies play a significant role in the maintenance of pluripotency and in cell fate determination. These factors are impossible to control using standard tissue culture methods. As such, there can be substantial batch-to-batch variability in cell line maintenance and differentiation yield. Here, we demonstrate a simple, robust technique for pluripotent stem cell expansion and cardiomyocyte differentiation by patterning cell colonies with a silicone stencil. We have observed that patterning human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies improves the uniformity and repeatability of their size, density, and shape. Uniformity of colony geometry leads to improved homogeneity in the expression of pluripotency markers SSEA4 and Nanog as compared with conventional clump passaging. Patterned cell colonies are capable of undergoing directed differentiation into spontaneously beating cardiomyocyte clusters with improved yield and repeatability over unpatterned cultures seeded either as cell clumps or uniform single cell suspensions. Circular patterns result in a highly repeatable 3D ring-shaped band of cardiomyocytes which electrically couple and lead to propagating contraction waves around the ring. Because of these advantages, geometrically patterning stem cells using stencils may offer greater repeatability from batch-to-batch and person-to-person, an increase in differentiation yield, a faster experimental workflow, and a simpler protocol to communicate and follow. Furthermore, the ability to control where cardiomyocytes arise across a culture well during differentiation could greatly aid the design of electrophysiological assays for drug-screening.

"On-chip cellomics: Single-cell-based constructive cell-network assay for quasi-in vivo screening of cardiotoxicity.","We have developed methods and systems of analyzing epigenetic information in cells, as well as that of genetic information, to expand our understanding of how living systems are determined. A system of analyzing epigenetic information was developed starting from the twin complementary viewpoints of cell regulation as an 'algebraic' system (emphasis on temporal aspects) and as a 'geometric' system (emphasis on spatial aspects). As an example of the 'geometric' system, we have developed an quasi-in vivo hiPS cardiomyocyte network assay and confirmed that it can predict the risk of lethal arrythmia correctly in 22 compounds. The knowlege acquired from this study may lead to the use of cells that fully control practical applications like cell-based drug screening and the regeneration of organs.

"The effect of encapsulation of cardiac stem cells within matrix-enriched hydrogel capsules on cell survival, post-ischemic cell retention and cardiac function.","Transplantation of ex<U+00A0>vivo proliferated cardiac stem cells (CSCs) is an emerging therapy for ischemic cardiomyopathy but outcomes are limited by modest engraftment and poor long-term survival. As such, we explored the effect of single cell microencapsulation to increase CSC engraftment and survival after myocardial injection. Transcript and protein profiling of human atrial appendage sourced CSCs revealed strong expression the pro-survival integrin dimers ¦ÁV¦Â3 and ¦Á5¦Â1- thus rationalizing the integration of fibronectin and fibrinogen into a supportive intra-capsular matrix. Encapsulation maintained CSC viability under hypoxic stress conditions and, when compared to standard suspended CSC, media conditioned by encapsulated CSCs demonstrated superior production of pro-angiogenic/cardioprotective cytokines, angiogenesis and recruitment of circulating angiogenic cells. Intra-myocardial injection of encapsulated CSCs after experimental myocardial infarction favorably affected long-term retention of CSCs, cardiac structure and function. Single cell encapsulation prevents detachment induced cell death while boosting the mechanical retention of CSCs to enhance repair of damaged myocardium. ","Biomaterials","24099706",2013,"Canada"
"Ultrasound-guided intracardial injection and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of single cells in mice as a paradigm for hematogenous metastases.","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important technique for noninvasive cell tracking in preclinical research. Following appropriate cell labeling MRI can be used to detect larger cell cohorts and also single cells in vivo in mice. Cell distribution to different organs such as brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys can be visualized, semi-quantified, and followed over time. Thus, the fate of single tumor cells and their eventual development to solid metastases could be investigated. Mesenchymal stromal cells can be used as a paradigm for metastasizing tumor cells. We have demonstrated a strategy for magnetic and fluorescent co-labeling of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), ultrasound-guided intracardial cell injection with efficient systemic cell delivery, and high-resolution MRI for repetitive visualization of disseminated co-labeled MSC on a single-cell level in vivo in mice. Furthermore, the fluorescent labeling of cells enabled effective histopathological validation. ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","24092442",2013,"United States"
"Motion compensation using a suctioning stabilizer for intravital microscopy.","Motion artifacts continue to present a major challenge to single cell imaging in cardiothoracic organs such as the beating heart, blood vessels, or lung. In this study, we present a new water-immersion suctioning stabilizer that enables minimally invasive intravital fluorescence microscopy using water-based stick objectives. The stabilizer works by reducing major motion excursions and can be used in conjunction with both prospective or retrospective gating approaches. We show that the new approach offers cellular resolution in the beating murine heart without perturbing normal physiology. In addition, because this technique allows multiple areas to be easily probed, it offers the opportunity for wide area coverage at high resolution.","Intravital","24086796",2013,"United States"
"Single cell tracking of gadolinium labeled CD4+ T cells by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.","Cellular therapy is emerging as a promising alternative to conventional immunosuppression in the fields of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, autoimmune disease, and solid organ transplantation. Determining the persistence of cell-based therapies in vivo is crucial to understanding their regulatory function and requires the combination of an extremely sensitive detection technique and a stable, long-lifetime cell labeling agent. This paper reports the first application of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to perform single cell detection of T cell populations relevant to cellular immunotherapy. Purified human CD4(+) T cells were labeled with commercially available Gd-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, Omniscan and Dotarem, which enabled passive loading of up to 10(8) Gd atoms per cell. In mixed preparations of labeled and unlabeled cells, LA-ICP-MS was capable of enumerating labeled cells at close to the predicted ratio. More importantly, LA-ICP-MS single cell analysis demonstrated that the cells retained a sufficient label to remain detectable for up to 10 days post-labeling both in vitro and in vivo in an immunodeficient mouse model.

"Apparent mtDNA sequence heterogeneity in single human blood CD34+ cells is markedly affected by storage and transport.","Single CD34(+) cells from adult human peripheral blood show mtDNA sequence heterogeneity. In this study, we compared mtDNA sequence variation in single CD34(+) cells from peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the same donors but under different conditions of storage and transport: group I, MNCs from heparinized PB that inadvertently required six days to be transported to the testing laboratory; group II, MNCs which were isolated from PB within a day of phlebotomy and frozen prior to transportation and storage. We observed more cell death for MNCs of group I than group II. Concordantly, group I CD34(+) cells had a very low potential for hematopoietic colony formation in vitro compared with group II cells. CD34(+) cells of group II showed an unexpectedly higher level of mtDNA sequence heterogeneity than was present in group I cells. These observations suggest that reduced mtDNA sequence heterogeneity in single CD34(+) cells of group I was likely due to elimination of cells harboring mutations. CD34(+) cells that survive stress ex vivo may be more enriched in quiescent primitive hematopoietic stem cells, with fewer mtDNA mutations than are present in committed progenitors. Technically, attention is required to conditions of preparation of human blood samples for single cell mtDNA analysis. ","Mutation research","24044942",2013,"United States"
"Congenital heart block maternal sera autoantibodies target an extracellular epitope on the ¦Á1G T-type calcium channel in human fetal hearts.","BACKGROUND: Congenital heart block (CHB) is a transplacentally acquired autoimmune disease associated with anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB maternal autoantibodies and is characterized primarily by atrioventricular (AV) block of the fetal heart. This study aims to investigate whether the T-type calcium channel subunit ¦Á1G may be a fetal target of maternal sera autoantibodies in CHB.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate differential mRNA expression of the T-type calcium channel CACNA1G (¦Á1G gene) in the AV junction of human fetal hearts compared to the apex (18-22.6 weeks gestation). Using human fetal hearts (20-22 wks gestation), our immunoprecipitation (IP), Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) staining results, taken together, demonstrate accessibility of the ¦Á1G epitope on the surfaces of cardiomyocytes as well as reactivity of maternal serum from CHB affected pregnancies to the ¦Á1G protein. By ELISA we demonstrated maternal sera reactivity to ¦Á1G was significantly higher in CHB maternal sera compared to controls, and reactivity was epitope mapped to a peptide designated as p305 (corresponding to aa305-319 of the extracellular loop linking transmembrane segments S5-S6 in ¦Á1G repeat I). Maternal sera from CHB affected pregnancies also reacted more weakly to the homologous region (7/15 amino acids conserved) of the ¦Á1H channel. Electrophysiology experiments with single-cell patch-clamp also demonstrated effects of CHB maternal sera on T-type current in mouse sinoatrial node (SAN) cells.SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results indicate that CHB maternal sera antibodies readily target an extracellular epitope of ¦Á1G T-type calcium channels in human fetal cardiomyocytes. CHB maternal sera also show reactivity for ¦Á1H suggesting that autoantibodies can target multiple fetal targets.","PloS one","24039792",2013,"Canada"
"From cellular characteristics to disease diagnosis: uncovering phenotypes with supercells.","Cell heterogeneity and the inherent complexity due to the interplay of multiple molecular processes within the cell pose difficult challenges for current single-cell biology. We introduce an approach that identifies a disease phenotype from multiparameter single-cell measurements, which is based on the concept of &quot;supercell statistics&quot;, a single-cell-based averaging procedure followed by a machine learning classification scheme. We are able to assess the optimal tradeoff between the number of single cells averaged and the number of measurements needed to capture phenotypic differences between healthy and diseased patients, as well as between different diseases that are difficult to diagnose otherwise. We apply our approach to two kinds of single-cell datasets, addressing the diagnosis of a premature aging disorder using images of cell nuclei, as well as the phenotypes of two non-infectious uveitides (the ocular manifestations of Beh<U+00E7>et's disease and sarcoidosis) based on multicolor flow cytometry. In the former case, one nuclear shape measurement taken over a group of 30 cells is sufficient to classify samples as healthy or diseased, in agreement with usual laboratory practice. In the latter, our method is able to identify a minimal set of 5 markers that accurately predict Beh<U+00E7>et's disease and sarcoidosis. This is the first time that a quantitative phenotypic distinction between these two diseases has been achieved. To obtain this clear phenotypic signature, about one hundred CD8(+) T cells need to be measured. Although the molecular markers identified have been reported to be important players in autoimmune disorders, this is the first report pointing out that CD8(+) T cells can be used to distinguish two systemic inflammatory diseases. Beyond these specific cases, the approach proposed here is applicable to datasets generated by other kinds of state-of-the-art and forthcoming single-cell technologies, such as multidimensional mass cytometry, single-cell gene expression, and single-cell full genome sequencing techniques.

"Single-cell quantitative HER2 measurement identifies heterogeneity and distinct subgroups within traditionally defined HER2-positive patients.","Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker for breast and gastric cancer prognosis and patient treatment decisions. HER2 positivity, as defined by IHC or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, remains an imprecise predictor of patient response to HER2-targeted therapies. Challenges to correct HER2 assessment and patient stratification include intratumoral heterogeneity, lack of quantitative and/or objective assays, and differences between measuring HER2 amplification at the protein versus gene level. We developed a novel immunofluorescence method for quantitation of HER2 protein expression at the single-cell level on FFPE patient samples. Our assay uses automated image analysis to identify and classify tumor versus non-tumor cells, as well as quantitate the HER2 staining for each tumor cell. The HER2 staining level is converted to HER2 protein expression using a standard cell pellet array stained in parallel with the tissue sample. This approach allows assessment of HER2 expression and heterogeneity within a tissue section at the single-cell level. By using this assay, we identified distinct subgroups of HER2 heterogeneity within traditional definitions of HER2 positivity in both breast and gastric cancers. Quantitative assessment of intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity may offer an opportunity to improve the identification of patients likely to respond to HER2-targeted therapies. The broad applicability of the assay was demonstrated by measuring HER2 expression profiles on multiple tumor types, and on normal and diseased heart tissues.","The American journal of pathology","24035511",2013,"United States"
"Heart failure-induced changes of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and cell excitability in rat cardiac postganglionic neurons.","Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by decreased cardiac parasympathetic and increased cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. This autonomic imbalance increases the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with CHF. We hypothesized that the molecular and cellular alterations of cardiac postganglionic parasympathetic (CPP) neurons located in the intracardiac ganglia and sympathetic (CPS) neurons located in the stellate ganglia (SG) possibly link to the cardiac autonomic imbalance in CHF. Rat CHF was induced by left coronary artery ligation. Single-cell real-time PCR and immunofluorescent data showed that L (Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3), P/Q (Ca(v)2.1), N (Ca(v)2.2), and R (Ca(v)2.3) types of Ca2+ channels were expressed in CPP and CPS neurons, but CHF decreased the mRNA and protein expression of only the N-type Ca2+ channels in CPP neurons, and it did not affect mRNA and protein expression of all Ca2+ channel subtypes in the CPS neurons. Patch-clamp recording confirmed that CHF reduced N-type Ca2+ currents and cell excitability in the CPP neurons and enhanced N-type Ca2+ currents and cell excitability in the CPS neurons. N-type Ca2+ channel blocker (1 ¦ÌM ¦Ø-conotoxin GVIA) lowered Ca2+ currents and cell excitability in the CPP and CPS neurons from sham-operated and CHF rats. These results suggest that CHF reduces the N-type Ca2+ channel currents and cell excitability in the CPP neurons and enhances the N-type Ca2+ currents and cell excitability in the CPS neurons, which may contribute to the cardiac autonomic imbalance in CHF.","American journal of physiology.

"Determinants of beat-to-beat variability of repolarization duration in the canine ventricular myocyte: a computational analysis.","Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization duration (BVR) is an intrinsic characteristic of cardiac function and a better marker of proarrhythmia than repolarization prolongation alone. The ionic mechanisms underlying baseline BVR in physiological conditions, its rate dependence, and the factors contributing to increased BVR in pathologies remain incompletely understood. Here, we employed computer modeling to provide novel insights into the subcellular mechanisms of BVR under physiological conditions and during simulated drug-induced repolarization prolongation, mimicking long-QT syndromes type 1, 2, and 3. We developed stochastic implementations of 13 major ionic currents and fluxes in a model of canine ventricular-myocyte electrophysiology. Combined stochastic gating of these components resulted in short- and long-term variability, consistent with experimental data from isolated canine ventricular myocytes. The model indicated that the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations is rate dependent due to the rate dependence of action-potential (AP) duration (APD). This process (the &quot;active&quot; component) and the intrinsic nonlinear relationship between membrane current and APD (&quot;intrinsic component&quot;) contribute to the rate dependence of BVR. We identified a major role in physiological BVR for stochastic gating of the persistent Na(+) current (INa) and rapidly activating delayed-rectifier K(+) current (IKr). Inhibition of IKr or augmentation of INa significantly increased BVR, whereas subsequent ¦Â-adrenergic receptor stimulation reduced it, similar to experimental findings in isolated myocytes. In contrast, ¦Â-adrenergic stimulation increased BVR in simulated long-QT syndrome type 1. In addition to stochastic channel gating, AP morphology, APD, and beat-to-beat variations in Ca(2+) were found to modulate single-cell BVR. Cell-to-cell coupling decreased BVR and this was more pronounced when a model cell with increased BVR was coupled to a model cell with normal BVR. In conclusion, our results provide new insights into the ionic mechanisms underlying BVR and suggest that BVR reflects multiple potentially proarrhythmic parameters, including increased ion-channel stochasticity, prolonged APD, and abnormal Ca(2+) handling.","PLoS computational biology","23990775",2013,"United States"
"Knockdown of PSMB7 induces autophagy in cardiomyocyte cultures: possible role in endoplasmic reticulum stress.","Proteasomal and autophagic pathways of protein degradation are two essential, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated proteolytic systems involved in the ER stress response. The functional interaction between them has been shown by proteasome pharmacological inhibition. However, little data have been found concerning autophagy induction using an RNA interference approach due to the multisubunit composition of proteolytic systems. We suggested that silencing of single proteasome subunits can induce massive autophagy. Psmb7-specific small interference RNA added to isolated cardiomyocytes significantly affected mRNA expression of essential ER stress marker proteins, including DDIT3/CHOP and HSPA5/GRP78. mRNA expression of the key autophagy regulator MTOR was also increased. These findings were confirmed by single-cell reverse transcription real-time PCR on individual monodansylcadaverine (MDC)-labeled cardiomyocytes. RNA interference that decreased the levels of non-catalytic PSMB7 subunits of the proteasome had no influence on chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities, but significantly decreased peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activity. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased levels of LC3-marked vacuoles in the cytoplasm of Psmb7-knockdown cells, and MDC staining showed significantly increased numbers of neonatal cardiomyocytes with autophagic vacuoles. After anoxia-reoxygenation, the number of cells with signs of autophagy after Psmb7 gene silencing was higher. Our results indicate that Psmb7 knockdown induces ER stress and autophagy in cardiomyocytes, which may be a useful approach to activate specific autophagy.

"A miniaturized multipurpose platform for rapid, label-free, and simultaneous separation, patterning, and in vitro culture of primary and rare cells.","Given that current cell isolation techniques are expensive, time consuming, yield low isolation purities, and/or alter target cell properties, a versatile, cost effective, and easy-to-operate microchip with the capability to simultaneously separate, capture, pattern, and culture rare and primary cells in vitro is developed. The platform is based on target cell adhesion onto the micro-fabricated interfaces produced by microcontact printing of cell-specific antibodies. Results show over 95% separation efficiency in less than 10 min for the separation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and cardiomyocytes from rat brain and heart mixtures, respectively. Target cell attachment and single cell spreading can be precisely controlled on the basis of the designed patterns. Both cell types can maintain their biofunctionality. Indeed, isolated OPCs can proliferate and differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, while isolated cardiomyocytes retain their contractile properties on the separation platform. Successful separation of two dissimilar cell types present in varying concentrations in their respective cell mixtures and the demonstration of their integrity after separation open new avenues for time and cost-effective sorting of various cell types using the developed miniaturized platform.

"Effect of engineered anisotropy on the susceptibility of human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes to arrhythmias.","Human (h) pluripotent stem cells (PSC) such as embryonic stem cells (ESC) can be directed into cardiomyocytes (CMs), representing a potential unlimited cell source for disease modeling, cardiotoxicity screening and myocardial repair. Although the electrophysiology of single hESC-CMs is now better defined, their multi-cellular arrhythmogenicity has not been thoroughly assessed due to the lack of a suitable experimental platform. Indeed, the generation of ventricular (V) fibrillation requires single-cell triggers as well as sustained multi-cellular reentrant events. Although native VCMs are aligned in a highly organized fashion such that electrical conduction is anisotropic for coordinated contractions, hESC-derived CM (hESC-CM) clusters are heterogenous and randomly organized, and therefore not representative of native conditions. Here, we reported that engineered alignment of hESC-VCMs on biomimetic grooves uniquely led to physiologically relevant responses. Aligned but not isotropic control preparations showed distinct longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) conduction velocities (CV), resembling the native human V anisotropic ratio (AR<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>LCV/TCV<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>1.8-2.0). Importantly, the total incidence of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias significantly reduced from 57% in controls to 17-23% of aligned preparations, thereby providing a physiological baseline for assessing arrhythmogenicity. As such, promotion of pro-arrhythmic effect (e.g., spatial dispersion by ¦Â adrenergic stimulation) could be better predicted. Mechanistically, such anisotropy-induced electrical stability was not due to maturation of the cellular properties of hESC-VCMs but their physical arrangement. In conclusion, not only do functional anisotropic hESC-VCMs engineered by multi-scale topography represent a more accurate model for efficacious drug discovery and development as well as arrhythmogenicity screening (of pharmacological and genetic factors), but our approach may also lead to future transplantable prototypes with improved efficacy and safety against arrhythmias.

"Lipid rescue reverses the bupivacaine-induced block of the fast Na+ current (INa) in cardiomyocytes of the rat left ventricle.","BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular resuscitation upon intoxication with lipophilic ion channel-blocking agents has proven most difficult. Recently, favorable results have been reported when lipid rescue therapy is performed, i.e., the infusion of a triglyceride-rich lipid emulsion during resuscitation. However, the mechanism of action is poorly understood.METHODS: The authors investigate the effects of a clinically used lipid emulsion (Lipoven<U+00F6>s<U+00AE> MCT 20%; Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) on the block of the fast Na current (INa) induced by the lipophilic local anesthetic bupivacaine in adult rat left ventricular myocytes by using the whole cell patch clamp technique.RESULTS: Bupivacaine at 10 ¦Ìm decreased INa by 54% (-19.3 ¡À 1.9 pApF vs. -42.3 ¡À 4.3 pApF; n = 17; P &lt; 0.001; VPip = -40 mV, 1 Hz). Addition of 10% lipid emulsion in the presence of bupivacaine produced a 37% increase in INa (-26.4 ¡À 2.8 pApF; n = 17; P &lt; 0.001 vs. bupivacaine alone). To test whether these results could be explained by a reduction in the free bupivacaine concentration by the lipid (lipid-sink effect), the authors removed the lipid phase from the bupivacaine-lipid mixture by ultracentrifugation. Also, the resulting water phase led to an increase in INa (+19%; n = 17; P &lt; 0.001 vs. bupivacaine), demonstrating that part of the bupivacaine had been removed during ultracentrifugation. The substantially less lipophilic mepivacaine (40 ¦Ìm) reduced INa by 27% (n = 24; P &lt; 0.001). The mepivacaine-lipid mixture caused a significant increase in INa (+17%; n = 24; P &lt; 0.001). For mepivacaine, only a small lipid-sink effect could be demonstrated (+8%; n = 23; P &lt; 0.01), reflecting its poor lipid solubility.CONCLUSION: The authors demonstrate lipid rescue on the single-cell level and provide evidence for a lipid-sink mechanism.","Anesthesiology","23941864",2013,"United States"
"Optimisation of ionic models to fit tissue action potentials: application to 3D atrial modelling.","A 3D model of atrial electrical activity has been developed with spatially heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. The atrial geometry, reconstructed from the male Visible Human dataset, included gross anatomical features such as the central and peripheral sinoatrial node (SAN), intra-atrial connections, pulmonary veins, inferior and superior vena cava, and the coronary sinus. Membrane potentials of myocytes from spontaneously active or electrically paced in vitro rabbit cardiac tissue preparations were recorded using intracellular glass microelectrodes. Action potentials of central and peripheral SAN, right and left atrial, and pulmonary vein myocytes were each fitted using a generic ionic model having three phenomenological ionic current components: one time-dependent inward, one time-dependent outward, and one leakage current. To bridge the gap between the single-cell ionic models and the gross electrical behaviour of the 3D whole-atrial model, a simplified 2D tissue disc with heterogeneous regions was optimised to arrive at parameters for each cell type under electrotonic load. Parameters were then incorporated into the 3D atrial model, which as a result exhibited a spontaneously active SAN able to rhythmically excite the atria. The tissue-based optimisation of ionic models and the modelling process outlined are generic and applicable to image-based computer reconstruction and simulation of excitable tissue.

"Lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus directly affects cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium transients.","Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is the key pathogenic factor of gram-positive bacteria and contributes significantly to organ dysfunction in sepsis, a frequent complication in critical care patients. We hypothesized that LTA directly affects cardiomyocyte function, thus contributing to cardiac failure in sepsis. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of LTA on contractile properties and calcium-transients of isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. When myocytes were exposed to LTA for 1h prior to analysis, the amplitudes of calcium-transients as well as sarcomere shortening increased to 130% and 142% at 1 Hz stimulation frequency. Relengthening of sarcomeres as well as decay of calcium-transients was accelerated after LTA incubation. Exposure to LTA for 24 h resulted in significant depression of calcium-transients as well as of sarcomere shortening compared to controls. One of the major findings of our experiments is that LTA most likely affects calcium-handling of the cardiomyocytes. The effect is exacerbated by reduced extracellular calcium, which resembles the clinical situation in septic patients. Functionally, an early stimulating effect of LTA with increased contractility of the cardiomyocytes may be an in vitro reflection of early hyperdynamic phases in clinical sepsis. Septic disorders have been shown to induce late hypodynamic states of the contractile myocardium, which is also supported at the single-cell level in vitro by results of our 24h-exposure to LTA.","Molecular immunology","23933512",2013,"England"

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in establishing single-cell SL in Langendorff-perfused hearts loaded with the membrane dye di-4-ANEPPS.CONCLUSIONS: Remote focusing microscopy can measure cell orientation in complex 2-photon data sets without capturing full z stacks.

"From cell phenotype to epigenetic mechanisms: new insights into regenerating myocardium.","The self-regenerating property of the adult myocardium is not a new discovery. Even though we could not confirm that the adult myocardium is a post-mitotic tissue, we should consider that its plasticity is extremely low. Studies are still in progress to decipher the mechanisms underlying the abovementioned potential fetal features of the adult heart. The modest results of several clinical trials based on the transplantation of millions of autologous stem cells into the dysfunctional heart have confirmed that the cross-talk of different signals, such as the microenvironment, promotes the regeneration of adult myocardium. Recent scientific evidence has revealed that cellular cross-talk does not depend on the action of a single cell phenotype. It is conceivable that the limited turnover of cardiomyocytes is ensured by the interplay of adult cardiac cells in response to environmental changes. The epigenetic state of a cell serves as a dynamic interface between the environment and phenotype. The epigenetic modulation of the adult cardiac cells by natural active compounds encourages further studies to improve myocardial plasticity. In this review, we will highlight the most relevant studies demonstrating the epigenetic modulation of myocardial regeneration without the use of stem cell transplantation.

"Single color FRET based measurements of conformational changes of proteins resulting from translocation inside cells.","Translocation of proteins to different parts of the cell is necessary for many cellular mechanisms as a means for regulation and a variety of other functions. Identifying how these proteins undergo conformational changes or interact with various partners during these events is critical to understanding how these mechanisms are executed. A protocol is presented that identifies conformational changes in a protein that occur during translocation while overcoming challenges in extracting distance information in very different environments of a living cell. Only two samples are required to be prepared and are observed with one optical setup. Live-cell FRET imaging has been applied to identify conformational changes between two native cysteines in Bax, a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulates apoptosis. Bax exists in the cytosol and translocates to the mitochondria outer membrane upon apoptosis induction. The distance, r, between the two native cysteines in the cytosolic structure of Bax necessitates the use of a FRET donor-accepter pair with R0~r as the most sensitive probe for identifying structural changes at these positions. Alexa Fluor 546 and Dabcyl, a dark acceptor, were used as FRET pairs - resulting in single color intensity variations of Alexa-546 as a measure of FRET efficiency. An internal reference, conjugated to Bax, was employed to normalize changes in fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor 546 due to inherent inhomogeneities in the living cell. This correction allowed the true FRET effects to be measured with increased precision during translocation. Normalization of intensities to the internal reference identified a FRET efficiency of 0.45¡À0.14 in the cytosol and 0.11¡À0.20 in the mitochondria. The procedure for the conjugation of the internal reference and FRET probes as well as the data analysis is presented. ","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)","23872323",2013,"United States"
"Single cell gene profiling revealed heterogeneity of paracrine effects of bone marrow cells in mouse infarcted hearts.","It is now recognized that transplantation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) into infarcted hearts has the capacity to improve the cardiac function through paracrine effects. However, detailed expression levels of paracrine factors in BMCs in infarcted hearts are poorly described. By use of laser capture microdissection combined with real-time PCR, we depicted the expression profiles of paracrine factors in infarcted hearts versus normal hearts. Consistent with the in vivo observation, a similar expression pattern was evidenced in cultured BMCs. Furthermore, BMCs displayed heterogeneity of paracrine effects in infarcted hearts as analyzed at the single cell level using single cell PCR. Interestingly, the CD45(+) subpopulation showed higher expression levels of angiogenic factors compared to other subpopulations. Finally, most angiogenic factors were induced under the microenvironment of infarction. Our study demonstrated the heterogeneity of paracrine effects in BMCs at single cell level in infarcted hearts, highlighting preferential expression of angiogenic factors in the CD45(+) subpopulation. These findings broaden our understanding of paracrine effects of BMCs in vivo, and offer new insights into BMCs therapy in myocardial infarction (MI). ","PloS one","23861876",2013,"United States"

"In silico investigation of the short QT syndrome, using human ventricle models incorporating electromechanical coupling.","INTRODUCTION: Genetic forms of the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) arise due to cardiac ion channel mutations leading to accelerated ventricular repolarization, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Results from experimental and simulation studies suggest that changes to refractoriness and tissue vulnerability produce a substrate favorable to re-entry. Potential electromechanical consequences of the SQTS are less well-understood. The aim of this study was to utilize electromechanically coupled human ventricle models to explore electromechanical consequences of the SQTS.METHODS AND RESULTS: The Rice et al. mechanical model was coupled to the ten Tusscher et al. ventricular cell model. Previously validated K(+) channel formulations for SQT variants 1 and 3 were incorporated. Functional effects of the SQTS mutations on [Ca(2+)] i transients, sarcomere length shortening and contractile force at the single cell level were evaluated with and without the consideration of stretch-activated channel current (I sac). Without I sac, at a stimulation frequency of 1Hz, the SQTS mutations produced dramatic reductions in the amplitude of [Ca(2+)] i transients, sarcomere length shortening and contractile force. When I sac was incorporated, there was a considerable attenuation of the effects of SQTS-associated action potential shortening on Ca(2+) transients, sarcomere shortening and contractile force. Single cell models were then incorporated into 3D human ventricular tissue models. The timing of maximum deformation was delayed in the SQTS setting compared to control.CONCLUSION: The incorporation of I sac appears to be an important consideration in modeling functional effects of SQT 1 and 3 mutations on cardiac electro-mechanical coupling. Whilst there is little evidence of profoundly impaired cardiac contractile function in SQTS patients, our 3D simulations correlate qualitatively with reported evidence for dissociation between ventricular repolarization and the end of mechanical systole.","Frontiers in physiology","23847545",2013,"Switzerland"
"In utero exposure to dicyclohexyl and di-n-hexyl phthalate possess genotoxic effects on testicular cells of male rats after birth in the comet and TUNEL assays.","Phthalates are diester derivatives of phthalic acid widely used in many commercial applications. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate possible genotoxicity of di-n-hexyl phthalate (DHP) and dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) at different concentrations using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays in testes samples of male rat pups. DCHP and DHP in corn oil were administered to the pregnant rats by gavage at the doses of 0 (vehicle), 20, 100, and 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1) from gestational day 6 (GD6) to GD19. After delivery, male rats were allowed to grow until prepubertal, pubertal, and adulthood. At necropsy, the blood samples were collected from heart and were excised immediately. The apoptotic cells of prepubertal, pubertal, and adult testis were detected using TUNEL assay. The comet assay was performed on blood lymphocytes and testes samples of adult male rats. The comet assay results showed that tail length, tail intensity, olive tail moment (OTM), and percentage of DNA present in tail were higher when DHP content was increased. Judging from the values of OTM and percentage of DNA, DHP could significantly induce DNA breakage at doses of 100 and 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1) compared with the control group. An increase in TUNEL-positive cells of prepubertal, pubertal, and adult testicular cells was observed in the treated groups. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to DHP and DCHP may possess genotoxic risk to testicular cells of rats at all stages of development, even at adulthood.

"Guiding cell migration by tugging.","The ability of cells to move directionally toward areas of stiffer extracellular matrix (ECM) via a process known as 'durotaxis' is thought to be critical for development and wound healing, but durotaxis can also drive cancer metastasis. Migration is driven by integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs), protein assemblies that couple contractile actomyosin bundles to the plasma membrane, transmit force generated by the cytoskeleton to the ECM, and convert the mechanical properties of the microenvironment into biochemical signals. To probe the stiffness of the ECM, motile fibroblasts modulate FA mechanics on the nanoscale and exert forces that are reminiscent of repeated tugging on the ECM. Within a single cell, all FAs tug autonomously and thus act as local rigidity sensors, allowing discernment of differences in the extracellular matrix rigidity at high spatial resolution. In this article, we review current advances that may shed light on the mechanism of traction force fluctuations within FAs. We also examine plausible downstream effectors of tugging forces which may regulate cytoskeletal and FA dynamics to guide cell migration in response to ECM stiffness gradients.

"Quantitative single cell and single molecule proteomics for clinical studies.","A central aspect of cellular systems biology is the study of cell-to-cell variability driven by network control of molecular noise. Proteins are produced in stochastic bursts and, although time averaging smoothes their accumulated levels, variation in their copy number is substantial in members of environmental sensing and signalling networks. We have developed a label-free, microfluidic antibody capture chip platform called the MAC chip, to quantify precisely the copy numbers of many proteins from a single cell in a multiplexed single assay format. We intend to investigate protein noise in circulating tumour cells (CTCs) isolated from biopsies of cancer patients through the identification of biomolecular signatures, such as p53 tumour suppressor protein, which correlate with biological properties and clinical outcomes during treatment.

"Sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells share a common progenitor in the neural crest in vivo.","BACKGROUND: The neural crest (NC) is a transient embryonic structure unique to vertebrates, which generates peripheral sensory and autonomic neurons, glia, neuroendocrine chromaffin and thyroid C-cells, melanocytes, and mesenchymal derivatives such as parts of the skull, heart, and meninges. The sympathoadrenal (SA) cell lineage is one major sub-lineage of the NC that gives rise to sympathetic neurons, chromaffin cells, and the intermediate small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. A key question is when during NC ontogeny do multipotent progenitors segregate into the different NC-derived lineages. Recent evidence suggested that sympathetic, sensory, and melanocyte progenitors delaminate from the thoracic neural tube (NT) in successive, largely non-overlapping waves and that at least certain NC progenitors are already fate-restricted within the NT. Whether sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells, suggested by cell culture studies to share a common progenitor, are also fate segregated in ovo prior to emigration, is not known.RESULTS: We have conducted single cell electroporations of a GFP-encoding plasmid into the dorsal midline of E2 chick NTs at the adrenomedullary level of the NC. Analysis of their derivatives, performed at E6, revealed that in most cases, labelled progeny was detected in both sympathetic ganglia and adrenal glands, where cells co-expressed characteristic marker combinations.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells share a common progenitor in the NT. Together with previous findings we suggest that phenotypic diversification of these sublineages is likely to occur after delamination from the NT and prior to target encounter.","Neural development","23777568",2013,"England"
"Cardiotoxicity and apoptotic activity in subacute endosulfan toxicity and the protective effect of vitamin C in rabbits: a pathological study.","Cardiovascular disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in humans and animals, and its etiology is usually unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the cardiac pathology of endosulfan toxicity and the protective effect of vitamin C in rabbits. Twenty-four rabbits were divided into 4 groups: (1) the END group was given a daily sublethal dose of endosulfan in corn oil by oral gavage for 6 weeks; (2) the END + C group received the endosulfan as well as vitamin C over the same 6-week period; (3) the OIL + C group received corn oil daily and vitamin C every other day; and (4) the OIL group received only corn oil daily. We observed microscopic hemorrhages, single-cell necrosis, inflammatory reactions, and fibrotic changes in the myocardium in the END group. Small hemorrhages and single-cell necrosis also were seen in some hearts in the END + C group, but no inflammation was observed. Caspase-3 immunoreactivity was more significant in myocardial cells in the END group compared with the others. A protective effect of vitamin C on lesions was observed in the END + C group. These results showed that endosulfan resulted in toxic changes in the hearts of rabbits, but this toxicity could be decreased with vitamin C treatment.","Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer","23758152",2013,"United States"
"Effect of azelnidipine and amlodipine on single cell mechanics in mouse cardiomyocytes.","Azelnidipine and amlodipine are dihydropyridine-type Ca(2+) channel blockers for the treatment of hypertension. Although these drugs have high vasoselectivity and small negative inotropic effects in vivo, little is known regarding their direct effects on cellular contractility without humoral regulation or the additive effects of these drugs with other antihypertensive drugs on myocardial contractility. To investigate the effects of Ca(2+) channel blockers on single cell mechanics, mouse cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated, and a pair of carbon fibers was attached to opposite cell-ends to stretch the cells. Cells were paced at 4 Hz superfused in normal Tyrode solution at 37¡ãC. Cell length and active/passive force calculated from carbon fiber bending were recorded in 6 different preload conditions. Slopes of end-systolic force-length relation curves (maximum elastance) were measured as an index of contractility before and after drugs were administered. Azelnidipine at 10nM and 100 nM did not change maximum elastance, while amlodipine at 100 nM did decrease maximum elastance. The combination of RNH-6270 (active form of angiotensin II receptor blocker, olmesartan, 10nM) and either amlodipine (10nM) or azelnidipine (10nM) did not affect maximum elastance. Although both amlodipine and azelnidipine can be used safely at therapeutically relevant concentrations even in combination with olmesartan, the present results suggest that azelnidipine has a less negative inotropic action compared to amlodipine.","European journal of pharmacology","23747592",2013,"Netherlands"
"Determination of local and global elastic moduli of valve interstitial cells cultured on soft substrates.","The elasticity of the extracellular matrix profoundly affects biological responses of cells, but also their mechanical properties. Single cell mechanical properties are often measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), but technical guidelines for AFM measurement of cells grown on soft substrates are not well established. In this study, the local and global elastic moduli of aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) cultured on soft polyacrylamide substrates (3-144kPa) were characterized via AFM force mapping using pyramidal and spherical tips, respectively. Local and global VIC modulus values both increased with substrate stiffness (p&lt;0.05), with the average local cell modulus being consistently two to three times greater than the global modulus (p&lt;0.05). For local measurements, a minimum of four measurements was required to observe the trend of increasing cell modulus with substrate stiffness, but there was no advantage to testing additional spots. The Hertz model was relatively accurate in estimating the global cell elastic modulus (&lt;12% error, based on validated finite element analyses), despite the cells being of finite thickness and grown on deformable substrates, neither of which are accounted for in the Hertz model. The results of this study provide practical guidelines for efficient AFM-based measurement of the mechanical properties of cells on gels. They also provide new physiologically-relevant data on VIC mechanical properties and their correlation with substrate stiffness-dependent cytoskeletal changes, with relevance to heart valve mechanobiology and disease.

"The CPVT-associated RyR2 mutation G230C enhances store overload-induced Ca2+ release and destabilizes the N-terminal domains.","CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) is an inherited life-threatening arrhythmogenic disorder. CPVT is caused by DADs (delayed after-depolarizations) that are induced by spontaneous Ca2+ release during SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) Ca2+ overload, a process also known as SOICR (store-overload-induced Ca2+ release). A number of mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor RyR2 are linked to CPVT. Many of these CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for SOICR and DADs by sensitizing RyR2 to luminal or luminal/cytosolic Ca2+ activation. Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. This observation led to the suggestion of a SOICR-independent disease mechanism for the G230C mutation. However, the cellular impact of this mutation on SOICR is yet to be determined. To this end, we generated stable inducible HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cell lines expressing the RyR2 WT (wild-type) and the G230C mutant. Using single-cell Ca2+ imaging, we found that the G230C mutation markedly enhanced the propensity for SOICR and reduced the SOICR threshold. Furthermore, the G230C mutation increased the sensitivity of single RyR2 channels to both luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation and the Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding. In addition, the G230C mutation decreased the thermal stability of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-547) of RyR2. These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2.

Described in this overview are different ways to measure hERG, from recent advances in automated electrophysiology to the quantification of channel protein trafficking and binding. The contribution of other cardiac ion channels to hERG data interpretation is also discussed. In addition, endpoint measures of the integrated activity of cardiac ion channels at the single-cell, tissue, and whole-animal level, including for example the well-established action potential to the more recent beat-to-beat variability, transmural dispersion of repolarization, and field potential duration, are described in the context of their ability to predict QT prolongation and torsadogenicity in humans.","Current protocols in pharmacology","23744708",2013,"United States"
"Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of atrial fibrillation-induced electrical remodelling: insights from the three-dimensional virtual human atria.","Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with structural and electrical remodelling in the atria, which are associated with a high recurrence of AF. Through biophysically detailed computer modelling, this study investigated mechanisms by which AF-induced electrical remodelling promotes and perpetuates AF. A family of Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel variant models of human atrial cell action potentials (APs), taking into account of intrinsic atrial electrophysiological properties, was modified to incorporate various experimental data sets on AF-induced changes of major ionic channel currents (ICaL, IKur, Ito, IK1, IKs, INaCa) and on intracellular Ca(2+) handling. The single cell models for control and AF-remodelled conditions were incorporated into multicellular three-dimensional (3D) atrial tissue models. Effects of the AF-induced electrical remodelling were quantified as the changes of AP profile, AP duration (APD) and its dispersion across the atria, and the vulnerability of atrial tissue to the initiation of re-entry. The dynamic behaviour of re-entrant excitation waves in the 3D models was characterised. In our simulations, AF-induced electrical remodelling abbreviated atrial APD non-uniformly across the atria; this resulted in relatively short APDs co-existing with marked regional differences in the APD at junctions of the crista terminalis/pectinate muscle, pulmonary veins/left atrium. As a result, the measured tissue vulnerability to re-entry initiation at these tissue junctions was increased. The AF-induced electrical remodelling also stabilized and accelerated re-entrant excitation waves, leading to rapid and sustained re-entry. Under the AF-remodelled condition, re-entrant scroll waves in the 3D model degenerated into persistent and erratic wavelets, leading to fibrillation. In conclusion, realistic 3D atrial tissue models indicate that AF-induced electrical remodelling produces regionally heterogeneous and shortened APD; these respectively facilitate initiation and maintenance of re-entrant excitation waves.","The Journal of physiology","23732649",2013,"United Kingdom"
"Simple suspension culture system of human iPS cells maintaining their pluripotency for cardiac cell sheet engineering.","In this study, a simple three-dimensional (3D) suspension culture method for the expansion and cardiac differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is reported. The culture methods were easily adapted from two-dimensional (2D) to 3D culture without any additional manipulations. When hiPSCs were directly applied to 3D culture from 2D in a single-cell suspension, only a few aggregated cells were observed. However, after 3<U+2009>days, culture of the small hiPSC aggregates in a spinner flask at the optimal agitation rate created aggregates which were capable of cell passages from the single-cell suspension. Cell numbers increased to approximately 10-fold after 12<U+2009>days of culture. The undifferentiated state of expanded hiPSCs was confirmed by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR, and the hiPSCs differentiated into three germ layers. When the hiPSCs were subsequently cultured in a flask using cardiac differentiation medium, expression of cardiac cell-specific genes and beating cardiomyocytes were observed. Furthermore, the culture of hiPSCs on Matrigel-coated dishes with serum-free medium containing activin A, BMP4 and FGF-2 enabled it to generate robust spontaneous beating cardiomyocytes and these cells expressed several cardiac cell-related genes, including HCN4, MLC-2a and MLC-2v. This suggests that the expanded hiPSCs might maintain the potential to differentiate into several types of cardiomyocytes, including pacemakers. Moreover, when cardiac cell sheets were fabricated using differentiated cardiomyocytes, they beat spontaneously and synchronously, indicating electrically communicative tissue. This simple culture system might enable the generation of sufficient amounts of beating cardiomyocytes for use in cardiac regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.","Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine","23728860",2013,"England"
"Human stem cell-based three-dimensional microtissues for advanced cardiac cell therapies.","Cardiac stem cell therapy has been proposed as a therapy option to treat the diseased myocardium. However, the low retention rate of transplanted single-cell suspensions remains a major issue of current therapy strategies. Therefore, the concept of scaffold-free cellular self-assembly into three-dimensional microtissues (3D-MTs) prior to transplantation may be beneficial to enhance retention and survival. We compared clinically relevant, human stem cell sources for their ability to generate 3D-MTs with particular regards to formation characteristics, proliferation-activity, viability and extracellular-matrix production. Single-cell suspensions of human bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs and hATMSCs), Isl1(+) cardiac progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-Isl1(+) cells), and undifferentiated human induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs) were characterized before to generate 3D-MTs using a hanging-drop culture. Besides the principal feasibility of cell-specific 3D-MT formation, a detailed head-to-head comparison between cell sources was performed using histology, immunocyto- and histo-chemistry as well as flow cytometry. Round-oval shaped and uniform 3D-MTs could be successfully generated from all cell types starting with a loose formation within the first 24 h that fully stabilized after 3 days and resulting in a mean 3D-MT diameter of 194.56 ¡À 18.01 ¦Ìm (hBMMSCs), 194.56 ¡À 16.30 ¦Ìm (hATMSCs), 159.73 ¡À 19.20 ¦Ìm (hESC-Isl1(+) cells) and 120.95 ¡À 7.97 ¦Ìm (hiPSCs). While all 3D-MTs showed a homogenous cell distribution, hiPSC-derived 3D-MTs displayed a compact cell formation primarily located at the outer margin. hESC-Isl1(+) and hiPSC-derived 3D-MTs maintained their proliferation-activity which was rather limited in the MSC-based 3D-MTs. All four 3D-MT types revealed a comparable viability in excess of 70% and showed a cell-specific expression profile being comparable to their single-cell counterparts. Extracellular matrix (ECM) production during 3D-MT formation was observed for all cell-specific 3D-MTs, with hiPSC-derived 3D-MTs being the fastest one. Interestingly, ECM distribution was homogenous for hATMSC- and hiPSC-based 3D-MTs, while it appeared to be primarily concentrated within in the center of hESC-Isl1(+) and hBMMSC-based 3D-MTs. The results of this head-to-head comparative study indicated that 3D-MTs can be successfully generated from hESC-derived Isl1(+) cells, hiPSCs and MSC lines upon hanging drop culture. Cell-specific 3D-MTs displayed sufficient viability and instant ECM formation. The concept of 3D-MT in vitro generation prior to cell transplantation may represent a promising delivery format for future strategies to enhance cellular engraftment and survival.","Biomaterials","23727259",2013,"Netherlands"

As it is well recognized that molecular cues that regulate leukocyte trafficking into inflammatory sites differ between various tissues, it is important to study organ-specific responses. Recently, intravital two-photon microscopy has been expanded to moving organs in the mouse such as beating hearts. Unlike previous experimental approaches to image cardiac tissue explants or isolated perfused heart preparations by two-photon microscopy, intravital imaging accounts for the mechanical force transmitted to vessels by the heartbeat and accurately assesses dynamic leukocyte behavior in the coronary vessels and myocardial tissue. Intravital two-photon imaging of beating hearts is a promising experimental tool that will help elucidate cellular and molecular immune processes that contribute to a variety of cardiovascular diseases.

"Suppression of cardiac alternans by alternating-period-feedback stimulations.","Alternans response, comprising a sequence of alternating long and short action potential durations in heart tissue, seen during rapid periodic pacing can lead to conduction block resulting in potentially fatal cardiac failure. A method of pacing with feedback control is proposed to reduce the alternans and therefore the probability of subsequent cardiac failure. The reduction is achieved by feedback control using small perturbations of constant magnitude to the original, alternans-generating pacing period T, viz., using sequences of two alternating periods of T+¦¤T and T-¦¤T, with ¦¤T&lt;T. Such a control scheme for alternans suppression is demonstrated experimentally in isolated whole heart experiments. This alternans suppression scheme is further confirmed and investigated in detail by simulations of ion-channel-based cardiac models both for a single cell and in one-dimensional spatially extended systems. The mechanism of the success of our method can be understood in terms of dynamics in phase space, viz., as the state of activity of the cell being confined within a narrow volume of phase space for the duration of control, resulting in extremely diminished variation in successive action potential durations. Our method is much more robust to noise than previous alternans reduction techniques based on fixed point stabilization and should thus be more efficient in terms of experimental implementation, which has implications for clinical treatment for arrhythmia.","Physical review.

"Reconstruction of retrospective cardiac activity--numerical study in a single cell and in a linear strand.","Although computational modeling of the prospective electrical activity in the cardiac tissue is well established and robust, the retrospective extrapolation of this activity has not been explored to date. Here, we establish an algorithm for the backward-in-time extrapolation of electrical activity from measurements taken in the present. Using minimal human cardiac kinetic models and a modified Newton-Raphson algorithm, we demonstrate the feasibility of past activity reconstruction in a single cell and in a linear strand. In a single cell, reconstruction of state variables' shape, the action potential morphology, and the time of stimulation was successful for up to 1300<U+2009>ms poststimulation and for data with signal-to-noise ratio levels higher than 40<U+2009>dB. For linear strands, the action potential morphology was reconstructed for 500<U+2009>ms poststimulation, and the reconstructed conduction velocity remained unaffected for signal-to-noise ratio levels higher than 50<U+2009>dB. Moreover, tissue restitution properties due to various pacing rates were successfully reconstructed by the backward-in-time algorithm. These preliminary results demonstrate that past cardiac activity may be reconstructed from measurements in the present. We envision that this methodology could be implemented in future clinical applications, for example to trace the location and timing of ectopic foci during ablation procedures.","International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering","23640786",2013,"England"
"Calcium dysregulation in ventricular myocytes from mice expressing constitutively active Rac1.","Increased Rac1 activity and its concomitant elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels is believed to be involved in the development of cardiac diseases such as hypertrophy and arrhythmia. To study the effects of activated Rac1 on the properties of isolated ventricular myocytes we used a transgenic mouse model (RacET) expressing constitutively active Rac1. Concurrent with dilated cardiomyopathy global Ca(2+) handling as well as single cell contractility was substantially decreased. Cellular ROS levels were assessed with two independent assays and unexpectedly depicted decreased ROS production in RacET that was uncoupled from hormonal stimulation. Western blot analysis illustrated a massive increase in cellular Rac1 activity concomitant with a reduction in NADPH-oxidase activity. Analysis of the Ca(2+) current, the ryanodine receptor and fractional Ca(2+) release uncovered defective excitation-contraction (ec) coupling and a substantial increase in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak together with a larger Ca(2+) spark amplitude and frequency. We conclude that Rac1 activity plays an important role for cardiac diseases but can be uncoupled from NADPH-oxidase activity. Rac1-mediated partial uncoupling of the ec-coupling machinery results in a ROS-independent disarrayed cellular Ca(2+) handling, contractility and impaired cardiac function.","Cell calcium","23631848",2013,"Netherlands"
"Global protein quantification of mouse heart tissue based on the SILAC mouse.","Metabolic labeling of living organisms with stable isotopes has become a powerful tool for global protein quantitation. The SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) approach is based on the incorporation of nonradioactive-labeled isotopic forms of amino acids into cellular proteins. The effective SILAC labeling of immortalized cells and single-cell organisms (e.g., yeast and bacteria) was recently extended to more complex organisms, including worms, flies, and even rodents. The administration of a (13)C6-lysine (heavy) containing diet for one mouse generation leads to a complete exchange of the natural (light) isotope (12)C6-lysine. SILAC-labeled organisms are mainly used as a heavy &quot;spike-in&quot; standard into nonlabeled counterparts, and the combination with high-performance mass spectrometers allows for global proteomic screening. Here we used the fully labeled SILAC mice to identify proteins based on SILAC pairs from isolated cardiomyocytes, and we analyzed ¦Â-parvin-deficient hearts. Our approach confirmed the absence ¦Â-parvin and revealed simultaneously a clear up regulation of ¦Á-parvin in heart tissue. In this protocol, we describe the generation of a SILAC mouse colony and show two approaches to perform a proteome-wide analysis of heart tissue. Thus, the SILAC mouse spike-in approach is a readily available procedure and allows for a straightforward systematic analysis of disease models and knockout mice.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","23606247",2013,"United States"
"Mimicking white matter tract topography using core-shell electrospun nanofibers to examine migration of malignant brain tumors.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the deadliest forms of human cancer, is characterized by its high infiltration capacity, partially regulated by the neural extracellular matrix (ECM). A major limitation in developing effective treatments is the lack of in vitro models that mimic features of GBM migration highways. Ideally, these models would permit tunable control of mechanics and chemistry to allow the unique role of each of these components to be examined. To address this need, we developed aligned nanofiber biomaterials via core-shell electrospinning that permit systematic study of mechanical and chemical influences on cell adhesion and migration. These models mimic the topography of white matter tracts, a major GBM migration 'highway'. To independently investigate the influence of chemistry and mechanics on GBM behaviors, nanofiber mechanics were modulated by using different polymers (i.e., gelatin, poly(ethersulfone), poly(dimethylsiloxane)) in the 'core' while employing a common poly(¦Å-caprolactone) (PCL) 'shell' to conserve surface chemistry. These materials revealed GBM sensitivity to nanofiber mechanics, with single cell morphology (Feret diameter), migration speed, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) expression all showing a strong dependence on nanofiber modulus. Similarly, modulating nanofiber chemistry using extracellular matrix molecules (i.e., hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen, and Matrigel) in the 'shell' material with a common PCL 'core' to conserve mechanical properties revealed GBM sensitivity to HA; specifically, a negative effect on migration. This system, which mimics the topographical features of white matter tracts, should allow further examination of the complex interplay of mechanics, chemistry, and topography in regulating brain tumor behaviors.","Biomaterials","23601662",2013,"United States"

"PGD for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: the route to universal tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.","Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is a method of testing in vitro embryos as an alternative to prenatal diagnosis with possible termination of pregnancy in case of an affected child. Recently, PGD for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has found its way in specialized labs. We describe the route to universal single-cell PGD tests for carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. Originally, mutation-specific protocols with one or two markers were set up and changed when new couples were not informative. This route of changing protocols was finalized after 2 years with universal tests for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers based on haplotyping of, respectively, 6 (BRCA1) and 8 (BRCA2) microsatellite markers in a multiplex PCR. Using all protocols, 30 couples had a total of 47 PGD cycles performed. Eight cycles were cancelled upon IVF treatment due to hypostimulation. Of the remaining 39 cycles, a total of 261 embryos were biopsied and a genetic diagnosis was obtained in 244 (93%). In 34 of the 39 cycles (84.6%), an embryo transfer was possible and resulted in 8 pregnancies leading to a fetal heart beat per oocyte retrieval of 20.5% and a fetal heart beat per embryonic transfer of 23.5%. The preparation time and costs for set-up and validation of tests are minimized. The informativity of microsatellite markers used in the universal PGD-PCR tests is based on CEPH and deCODE pedigrees, making the tests applicable in 90% of couples coming from these populations.

"The TGR5 receptor mediates bile acid-induced itch and analgesia.","Patients with cholestatic disease exhibit pruritus and analgesia, but the mechanisms underlying these symptoms are unknown. We report that bile acids, which are elevated in the circulation and tissues during cholestasis, cause itch and analgesia by activating the GPCR TGR5. TGR5 was detected in peptidergic neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord that transmit itch and pain, and in dermal macrophages that contain opioids. Bile acids and a TGR5-selective agonist induced hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglia neurons and stimulated the release of the itch and analgesia transmitters gastrin-releasing peptide and leucine-enkephalin. Intradermal injection of bile acids and a TGR5-selective agonist stimulated scratching behavior by gastrin-releasing peptide- and opioid-dependent mechanisms in mice. Scratching was attenuated in Tgr5-KO mice but exacerbated in Tgr5-Tg mice (overexpressing mouse TGR5), which exhibited spontaneous pruritus. Intraplantar and intrathecal injection of bile acids caused analgesia to mechanical stimulation of the paw by an opioid-dependent mechanism. Both peripheral and central mechanisms of analgesia were absent from Tgr5-KO mice. Thus, bile acids activate TGR5 on sensory nerves, stimulating the release of neuropeptides in the spinal cord that transmit itch and analgesia.

Incidents of adverse cardiac drug reactions are more common in patients with preexisting heart disease than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac drug toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds.METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potential duration and drug-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Disease phenotypes were verified in long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy hiPSC-CMs by immunostaining and single cell patch clamp. Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human ether-a-go-go-related gene expressing human embryonic kidney cells were used as controls. Single cell PCR confirmed expression of all cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in human embryonic kidney cells. Disease-specific hiPSC-CMs demonstrated increased susceptibility to known cardiotoxic drugs as measured by action potential duration and quantification of drug-induced arrhythmias such as early afterdepolarizations and delayed afterdepolarizations.CONCLUSIONS: We have recapitulated drug-induced cardiotoxicity profiles for healthy subjects, long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy patients at the single cell level for the first time. Our data indicate that healthy and diseased individuals exhibit different susceptibilities to cardiotoxic drugs and that use of disease-specific hiPSC-CMs may predict adverse drug responses more accurately than the standard human ether-a-go-go-related gene test or healthy control hiPSC-CM/hESC-CM screening assays.","Circulation","23519760",2013,"United States"
"Automated micropipette aspiration of single cells.","This paper presents a system for mechanically characterizing single cells using automated micropipette aspiration. Using vision-based control and position control, the system controls a micromanipulator, a motorized translation stage, and a custom-built pressure system to position a micropipette (4 ¦Ìm opening) to approach a cell, form a seal, and aspirate the cell into the micropipette for quantifying the cell's elastic and viscoelastic parameters as well as viscosity. Image processing algorithms were developed to provide controllers with real-time visual feedback and to accurately measure cell deformation behavior on line. Experiments on both solid-like and liquid-like cells demonstrated that the system is capable of efficiently performing single-cell micropipette aspiration and has low operator skill requirements.","Annals of biomedical engineering","23508635",2013,"United States"
"Unique mechanistic insights into the beneficial effects of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors in the prevention of cardiac fibrosis.","Tissue fibrosis represents one of the largest groups of diseases for which there are very few effective therapies. In the heart, myocardial infarction (MI) resulting in the loss of cardiac myocytes can culminate in adverse cardiac remodeling leading to eventual heart failure. Adverse cardiac remodeling includes myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and electrical remodeling. We have previously demonstrated the beneficial effects of several potent soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) in different models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Here, we directly determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of sEHIs in cardiac remodeling post-MI. Treatment with a potent sEHI, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidine-4-yl)urea (TPPU), which was started 1 wk post-MI in a murine model, results in a significant improvement in cardiac function. Importantly, treatment with TPPU results in a decrease in cardiac fibrosis as quantified using histological and immunostaining techniques. Moreover, single-cell-based assays demonstrate that treatment with TPPU results in a significant decrease not only in the percentages but also the proliferative capacity of different populations of cardiac fibroblasts as well as a reduction in the migration of fibroblasts into the heart from the bone marrow. Our study provides evidence for a possible unique therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiac fibrosis and improve cardiac function post-MI.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","23493561",2013,"United States"
"Effects of the antianginal drug, ranolazine, on the brain sodium channel Na(V)1.2 and its modulation by extracellular protons.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ranolazine is an antianginal drug currently approved for treatment of angina pectoris in the United States. Recent studies have focused on its effects on neuronal channels and its possible therapeutic uses in the nervous system. We characterized how ranolazine affects the brain sodium channel, Na(V)1.2, and how its actions are modulated by low pH. In this way, we further explore ranolazine's potential as an anticonvulsant and its efficacy in conditions like those during an ischaemic stroke.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We performed whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na(V)1.2. Experiments were performed with extracellular solution titrated to either pH<U+2009>7.4 or pH<U+2009>6.0 before and after ranolazine perfusion.KEY RESULTS: Ranolazine accelerates onset and slows recovery of fast and slow inactivation. Ranolazine increases the maximum probability of use-dependent inactivation and reduces macroscopic and ramp sodium currents at pH<U+2009>7.4. pH<U+2009>6.0 reduced the slowing of fast inactivation recovery and inhibited use-dependent block by ranolazine. In the presence of ranolazine, the time constants of slow inactivation recovery and onset were significantly increased at pH<U+2009>6.0 relative to pH<U+2009>7.4 with 100 ¦ÌM ranolazine.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our work provides novel insights into the modulation of brain sodium channel, Na(V)1.2, by ranolazine. We demonstrate that ranolazine binds Na(V)1.2 in a state-dependent manner, and that the effects of ranolazine are slowed but not abolished by protons. Our results suggest that further research performed on channels with epilepsy-causing mutations may prove ranolazine to be an efficacious therapy.","British journal of pharmacology","23472826",2013,"England"
"Mosaic analysis with double markers reveals cell-type-specific paternal growth dominance.","Genomic imprinting leads to preferred expression of either the maternal or paternal alleles of a subset of genes. Imprinting is essential for mammalian development, and its deregulation causes many diseases. However, the functional relevance of imprinting at the cellular level is poorly understood for most imprinted genes. We used mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) in mice to create uniparental disomies (UPDs) and to visualize imprinting effects with single-cell resolution. Although chromosome 12 UPD did not produce detectable phenotypes, chromosome 7 UPD caused highly significant paternal growth dominance in the liver and lung, but not in the brain or heart. A single gene on chromosome 7, encoding the secreted insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), accounts for most of the paternal dominance effect. Mosaic analyses implied additional imprinted loci on chromosome 7 acting cell autonomously to transmit the IGF2 signal. Our study reveals chromosome- and cell-type specificity of genomic imprinting effects.","Cell reports","23453967",2013,"United States"
"KCNJ2 mutation in short QT syndrome 3 results in atrial fibrillation and ventricular proarrhythmia.","We describe a mutation (E299V) in KCNJ2, the gene that encodes the strong inward rectifier K(+) channel protein (Kir2.1), in an 11-y-old boy. The unique short QT syndrome type-3 phenotype is associated with an extremely abbreviated QT interval (200 ms) on ECG and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Genetic screening identified an A896T substitution in a highly conserved region of KCNJ2 that resulted in a de novo mutation E299V. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that E299V presents an abnormally large outward IK1 at potentials above -55 mV (P &lt; 0.001 versus wild type) due to a lack of inward rectification. Coexpression of wild-type and mutant channels to mimic the heterozygous condition still resulted in a large outward current. Coimmunoprecipitation and kinetic analysis showed that E299V and wild-type isoforms may heteromerize and that their interaction impairs function. The homomeric assembly of E299V mutant proteins actually results in gain of function. Computer simulations of ventricular excitation and propagation using both the homozygous and heterozygous conditions at three different levels of integration (single cell, 2D, and 3D) accurately reproduced the electrocardiographic phenotype of the proband, including an exceedingly short QT interval with merging of the QRS and the T wave, absence of ST segment, and peaked T waves. Numerical experiments predict that, in addition to the short QT interval, absence of inward rectification in the E299V mutation should result in atrial fibrillation. In addition, as predicted by simulations using a geometrically accurate three-dimensional ventricular model that included the His-Purkinje network, a slight reduction in ventricular excitability via 20% reduction of the sodium current should increase vulnerability to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","23440193",2013,"United States"
"Mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte interactions under defined contact modes on laser-patterned biochips.","Understanding how stem cells interact with cardiomyocytes is crucial for cell-based therapies to restore the cardiomyocyte loss that occurs during myocardial infarction and other cardiac diseases. It has been thought that functional myocardial repair and regeneration could be regulated by stem cell-cardiomyocyte contact. However, because various contact modes (junction formation, cell fusion, partial cell fusion, and tunneling nanotube formation) occur randomly in a conventional coculture system, the particular regulation corresponding to a specific contact mode could not be analyzed. In this study, we used laser-patterned biochips to define cell-cell contact modes for systematic study of contact-mediated cellular interactions at the single-cell level. The results showed that the biochip design allows defined stem cell-cardiomyocyte contact-mode formation, which can be used to determine specific cellular interactions, including electrical coupling, mechanical coupling, and mitochondria transfer. The biochips will help us gain knowledge of contact-mediated interactions between stem cells and cardiomyocytes, which are fundamental for formulating a strategy to achieve stem cell-based cardiac tissue regeneration.","PloS one","23418583",2013,"United States"
"Store-operated calcium entry in vagal sensory nerves is independent of Orai channels.","Vagal sensory nerves innervate the majority of visceral organs (e.g., heart, lungs, GI tract, etc) and their activation is critical for defensive and regulatory reflexes. Intracellular Ca(2+) is a key regulator of neuronal excitability and is largely controlled by the Ca(2+) stores of the endoplasmic reticulum. In other cell types store-operated channels (SOC) have been shown to contribute to the homeostatic control of intracellular Ca(2+). Here, using Ca(2+) imaging, we have shown that ER depletion in vagal sensory neurons (using thapsigargin or caffeine) in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) evoked Ca(2+) influx upon re-introduction of Ca(2+) into the extracellular buffer. This store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) was observed in approximately 25-40% of vagal neurons, equally distributed among nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensory subtypes. SOCE was blocked by Gd(3+) but not by the Orai channel blocker SKF96365. We found Orai channel mRNA in extracts from whole vagal ganglia, but when using single cell RT-PCR analysis we found only 3 out of 34 neurons expressed Orai channel mRNA, indicating that Orai channel expression in the vagal ganglia was likely derived from non-neuronal cell types. Confocal microscopy of vagal neurons in 3 day cultures demonstrated rich ER tracker fluorescence throughout axonal and neurite structures and ER store depletion (thapsigargin) evoked Ca(2+) transients from these structures. However, no SOCE could be detected in the axonal/neurite structures of vagal neurons. We conclude that SOCE occurs in vagal sensory neuronal cell bodies through non-Orai mechanisms but is absent at nerve terminals.","Brain research","23399679",2013,"United States"
"Classic &quot;broken cell&quot; techniques and newer live cell methods for cell cycle assessment.","Many common, important diseases are either caused or exacerbated by hyperactivation (e.g., cancer) or inactivation (e.g., heart failure) of the cell division cycle. A better understanding of the cell cycle is critical for interpreting numerous types of physiological changes in cells. Moreover, new insights into how to control it will facilitate new therapeutics for a variety of diseases and new avenues in regenerative medicine. The progression of cells through the four main phases of their division cycle [G(0)/G(1), S (DNA synthesis), G(2), and M (mitosis)] is a highly conserved process orchestrated by several pathways (e.g., transcription, phosphorylation, nuclear import/export, and protein ubiquitination) that coordinate a core cell cycle pathway. This core pathway can also receive inputs that are cell type and cell niche dependent. &quot;Broken cell&quot; methods (e.g., use of labeled nucleotide analogs) to assess for cell cycle activity have revealed important insights regarding the cell cycle but lack the ability to assess living cells in real time (longitudinal studies) and with single-cell resolution. Moreover, such methods often require cell synchronization, which can perturb the pathway under study. Live cell cycle sensors can be used at single-cell resolution in living cells, intact tissue, and whole animals. Use of these more recently available sensors has the potential to reveal physiologically relevant insights regarding the normal and perturbed cell division cycle.","American journal of physiology.

"Characterization of functional capacity of adult ventricular myocytes in long-term culture.","BACKGROUND: Functional properties of freshly isolated adult ventricular myocytes (AVMs) or those of AVMs during first few weeks in culture were well described. However, the functional capacity of these AVMs such as regenerative potential remains unknown, in part, due to the short lifespan of AVMs in culture. This study modified culture conditions that extended the lifespan of AVMs, isolated from adult rat hearts, longer than 6 months.METHODS: Temporal changes in the morphology of individual AVMs, cell-cell interaction, formation of myofibers, self-repair capacity after injury, expression of senescence biomarkers, and contractile function of AVMs over 5 weeks (defined as long-term culture) were chronologically characterized and quantified with live-cell video and fluorescence microscopy, and immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: Cell growth in size reached a plateau after 4 weeks in culture concomitantly with continuous increase in structural remodeling in long-term culture. Dynamic remodeling of AVMs promoted self-contact of filopodia and cell-cell contact where these contained abundant myofilaments, connexin 43 proteins, and high density and high integrity of mitochondria. Such high capacity also enabled self-repair of AVMs after injury, cytokinesis, and formation of myofibers. AVMs in long-term culture displayed spontaneous contraction and importantly were responsive to electrical stimulation. Moreover, AVMs expressed senescence-associated ¦Â-galactosidase, p16, and stress-associated atrial natriuretic peptides that resulted likely from cellular modeling.CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged longevity of AVMs in culture with characteristics of high functional capacity of organelle regeneration and contraction makes them invaluable for further longitudinal mechanistic studies in cardiac (patho)physiology (e.g., hypertrophy and aging), single-cell analysis (e.g., function of hetero-phenotypes) and drug discovery.","International journal of cardiology","23375882",2013,"Netherlands"
"Establishment of isolation and expansion protocols for human cardiac C-kit-positive progenitor cells for stem cell therapy.","Although cardiac stem cells (CSCs) have emerged in regeneration research, the number of isolated CSCs is low, making a sufficient supply of functional elements an important consideration in cardiovascular research. In this study, we established an efficient method for CSC isolation. We directly compared cultures of single cells to human cardiac-derived c-kit-positive progenitor cells (hCPCs(c-kit+)). The two protocols employed enzymatically digested hCPCs(c-kit+) (ED-hCPCs) with tissue-expanded hCPC(c-kit+) (TE-hCPCs). Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we showed the concentration of c-kit in TE-hCPCs to be higher than in ED-hCPCs, although the total number of c-kit positive cells resulting from ED-hCPCs was similar to that resulting from TE-hCPCs. The cardiomyocyte-associated proteins, GATA4 and Nkx2-5, which were expressed during hCPCs expansion, did not differ between the isolation methods. Importantly, the expression of the CSC stem cell marker, c-kit, was more efficiently preserved using the ED-hCPCs versus the TE-hCPCs method. In a cell proliferation assay, the ED-hCPCs method produced a significantly greater number of cells. Finally, hCPCs derived using both protocols differentiated into endothelial, smooth muscle, and cardiomyocyte lineages. In conclusion, the single-cell culture protocol using an enzymatic digestion method may be more useful to isolate human cardiac-derived c-kit-positive elements compared with the tissue expansion method.","Transplantation proceedings","23375332",2013,"United States"
"Arrhythmogenic substrate for atrial fibrillation: insights from an integrative computational model of pulmonary veins.","Mechanisms underlying the genesis of re-entrant substrate for atrial fibrillation (AF) in the pulmonary veins (PVs) and left atrium (LA) are not well understood. We develop a biophysically detailed computational model for the PVs and surrounding LA tissue. The model integrates canine PV and LA single cell electrophysiology with the respective 3D tissue geometry and fiber orientation reconstructed from micro-CT data. The model simulations demonstrate that a combination of tissue anisotropy and electrical heterogeneity between the PVs and LA causes a break-down of normal electrical excitation wave-fronts. This leads to the generation of a high-frequency re-entrant source near the PV sleeves. Evidence of such sources have been seen clinically in AF patients. In summary, our modeling results provide new insights into the arrhythmogenic mechanisms of re-entrant excitation waves underlying AF.","Conference proceedings : ...

The model was used to investigate two frequently-proposed modes of SAN architecture: the gradient and mosaic hypotheses. In a simplified gradient arrangement, the peripheral SAN region acts as a transition zone between the central SAN and atrium and is required for spontaneous rhythmic initiation of APs from central SAN into the atria. Furthermore, the application of optimized single cell parameters to the realistic 2D rabbit geometry did not accurately replicate experimentally recorded APs. On the other hand, in an adapted mosaic geometry, peripheral SAN cells were not required to produce spontaneous regular excitation.","Conference proceedings : ...

"The use of agarose microwells for scalable embryoid body formation and cardiac differentiation of human and murine pluripotent stem cells.","In most pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) is an important step. Here we describe a rapid, straightforward soft lithography approach for the preparation of hydrophilic silicon masters from different templates and the subsequent production of patterned agarose-DMEM microwell surfaces for scalable well standardized stem cell aggregation and EB formation. The non-adhesive agarose microwell plates represent an accurate replication of the templates' topography and were used for aggregation of murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Direct microscopic assessment by time-lapse analysis demonstrated rapid formation of uniformly shaped EBs from murine iPSCs with similar or even more consistent results concerning size distribution and harvesting efficiency compared to the commonly used but time-consuming hanging drop technique. For human ESCs, homogenous aggregates were obtained after single cell inoculation on agarose microwells with efficient differentiation into the cardiac lineage using state-of-the-art protocols for directed differentiation via small molecules. With this soft lithography-based strategy, sufficient and reproducible numbers of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes necessary for tissue engineering purposes can be realized in a highly controllable manner. Moreover, it might be useful for different cell types in any application that requires scalable and highly standardized aggregation.","Biomaterials","23332176",2013,"Netherlands"
"Transcatheter based electromechanical mapping guided intramyocardial transplantation and in vivo tracking of human stem cell based three dimensional microtissues in the porcine heart.","Stem cells have been repeatedly suggested for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the low retention rate of single cell suspensions limits the efficacy of current therapy concepts so far. Taking advantage of three dimensional (3D) cellular self-assembly prior to transplantation may be beneficial to overcome these limitations. In this pilot study we investigate the principal feasibility of intramyocardial delivery of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D microtissues (3D-MTs) in a porcine model. 3D-MTs were generated from iron-oxide (MPIO) labeled human adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) using a modified hanging-drop method. Nine pigs (33 ¡À 2 kg) comprising seven healthy ones and two with chronic MI in the left ventricle (LV) anterior wall were included. The pigs underwent intramyocardial transplantation of 16 ¡Á 10(3) 3D-MTs (1250 cells/MT; accounting for 2 ¡Á 10(7) single ATMSCs) into the anterior wall of the healthy pigs (n = 7)/the MI border zone of the infarcted (n = 2) of the LV using a 3D NOGA electromechanical mapping guided, transcatheter based approach. Clinical follow-up (FU) was performed for up to five weeks and in-vivo cell-tracking was performed using serial magnet resonance imaging (MRI). Thereafter, the hearts were harvested and assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Intramyocardial transplantation of human ATMSC based 3D-MTs was successful in eight animals (88.8%) while one pig (without MI) died during the electromechanical mapping due to sudden cardiac-arrest. During FU, no arrhythmogenic, embolic or neurological events occurred in the treated pigs. Serial MRI confirmed the intramyocardial presence of the 3D-MTs by detection of the intracellular iron-oxide MPIOs during FU. Intramyocardial retention of 3D-MTs was confirmed by PCR analysis and was further verified on histology and immunohistochemical analysis. The 3D-MTs appeared to be viable, integrated and showed an intact micro architecture. We demonstrate the principal feasibility and safety of intramyocardial transplantation of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D-MTs. Multimodal cell-tracking strategies comprising advanced imaging and in-vitro tools allow for in-vivo monitoring and post-mortem analysis of transplanted 3D-MTs. The concept of 3D cellular self-assembly represents a promising application format as a next generation technology for cell-based myocardial regeneration.","Biomaterials","23332174",2013,"Netherlands"
"Benchmarking electrophysiological models of human atrial myocytes.","Mathematical modeling of cardiac electrophysiology is an insightful method to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF). In past years, five models of human atrial electrophysiology with different formulations of ionic currents, and consequently diverging properties, have been published. The aim of this work is to give an overview of strengths and weaknesses of these models depending on the purpose and the general requirements of simulations. Therefore, these models were systematically benchmarked with respect to general mathematical properties and their ability to reproduce certain electrophysiological phenomena, such as action potential (AP) alternans. To assess the models' ability to replicate modified properties of human myocytes and tissue in cardiac disease, electrical remodeling in chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) was chosen as test case. The healthy and remodeled model variants were compared with experimental results in single-cell, 1D and 2D tissue simulations to investigate AP and restitution properties, as well as the initiation of reentrant circuits.","Frontiers in physiology","23316167",2013,"Switzerland"

Many organs and tissues cannot be studied, especially longitudinally, because they are located too deep, behind bony structures or too close to the lung and heart. Here we report a novel mouse model that allows long-term single cell imaging of many organs. A wide variety of live tissues were successfully engrafted in the pinna of the mouse ear. Many of these engrafted tissues maintained the normal tissue histology. Using the heart and thymus as models, we further demonstrated that the engrafted tissues functioned as would be expected. Combining two-photon microscopy with fluorescent tracers, we successfully visualized the engrafted tissues at the single cell level in live mice over several months. Four dimensional (three-dimensional (3D) plus time) information of individual cells was obtained from this imaging. This model makes long-term high resolution 4D imaging of multiple organs possible.","PloS one","23300962",2013,"United States"
"Abnormal calcium handling properties underlie familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathology in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.","Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is<U+00A0>a prevalent hereditary cardiac disorder linked to arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. While the causes of HCM have been identified as genetic mutations in the cardiac sarcomere, the pathways by which sarcomeric mutations engender myocyte hypertrophy and electrophysiological abnormalities are not understood. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying HCM development, we generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from a ten-member family cohort carrying a hereditary HCM missense mutation (Arg663His) in the MYH7 gene. Diseased iPSC-CMs recapitulated numerous aspects of the HCM phenotype including cellular enlargement and contractile arrhythmia at the single-cell level. Calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging indicated dysregulation of Ca(2+) cycling and elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) are central mechanisms for disease pathogenesis. Pharmacological restoration of Ca(2+) homeostasis prevented development of hypertrophy and electrophysiological irregularities. We anticipate that these findings will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying HCM development and identify novel therapies for the disease.","Cell stem cell","23290139",2013,"United States"
"High resolution imaging of the human cardiac conduction system using reflectance confocal microscopy.","Rhythmical contraction of the heart is controlled by the cardiac conduction system (CCS) that consists of the three main parts: the sino-atrial node, the atrioventricular node and the His-Purkinje system.  A heartbeat signal, originated from CCS, spreads through its branches to the different parts of the heart, initiating depolarization of the ventricles.  However, this highly important system could not be distinguished visually from the surrounding heart tissues: myocardium (MC) and connective tissue (CT).  Thus, during surgical procedures, CCS could be easily damaged; namely, the reliable method for identification of CCS either in vivo or ex vivo does not exist.  Accordingly, there is a definite need for developing a CCS imaging method.  Reflection confocal microscopy (RCM) offers non-destructive imaging of the tissue at depths of up to 0.35 mm with the capability of identification of a single cell.  During the visualization procedure, a given tissue is illuminated with infrared laser light and the image is obtained because of different reflections from the tissue structures.  However, the reflective structures in the heart tissues are still not identified.  In the present study, for the first time we investigated cardiac tissues by RCM.  The resolution of the method allowed us to distinguish MC cells and CCS cells.  The method also allowed us to distinguish the network-like structures that are main components of CT.  The ability to visualize different tissue components indicates a great potential for RCM to be used in non-destructive cardiac investigations and for imaging CCS.","The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine","23269205",2012,"Japan"
"Real-time determination of sarcomere length of a single cardiomyocyte during contraction.","Sarcomere length of a cardiomyocyte is an important control parameter for physiology studies on a single cell level; for instance, its accurate determination in real time is essential for performing single cardiomyocyte contraction experiments. The aim of this work is to develop an efficient and accurate method for estimating a mean sarcomere length of a contracting cardiomyocyte using microscopy images as an input. The novelty in developed method lies in 1) using unbiased measure of similarities to eliminate systematic errors from conventional autocorrelation function (ACF)-based methods when applied to region of interest of an image, 2) using a semianalytical, seminumerical approach for evaluating the similarity measure to take into account spatial dependence of neighboring image pixels, and 3) using a detrend algorithm to extract the sarcomere striation pattern content from the microscopy images. The developed sarcomere length estimation procedure has superior computational efficiency and estimation accuracy compared with the conventional ACF and spectral analysis-based methods using fast Fourier transform. As shown by analyzing synthetic images with the known periodicity, the estimates obtained by the developed method are more accurate at the subpixel level than ones obtained using ACF analysis. When applied in practice on rat cardiomyocytes, our method was found to be robust to the choice of the region of interest that may 1) include projections of carbon fibers and nucleus, 2) have uneven background, and 3) be slightly disoriented with respect to average direction of sarcomere striation pattern. The developed method is implemented in open-source software.","American journal of physiology. Cell physiology","23255581",2012,"United Kingdom"
"Strategies for engineering C(4) photosynthesis.","C(3) photosynthesis is an inefficient process, because the enzyme that lies at the heart of the Benson-Calvin cycle, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) is itself a very inefficient enzyme. The oxygenase activity of Rubisco is an unavoidable side reaction that is a consequence of its reaction mechanism. The product of oxygenation, glycollate 2-P, has to be retrieved by photorespiration, a process which results in the loss of a quarter of the carbon that was originally present in glycollate 2-P. Photorespiration therefore reduces carbon gain. Purely in terms of carbon economy, there is, therefore, a strong selection pressure on plants to reduce the rate of photorespiration so as to increase carbon gain, but it also improves water- and nitrogen-use efficiency. Possibilities for the manipulation of plants to decrease the amount of photorespiration include the introduction of improved Rubisco from other species, reconfiguring photorespiration, or introducing carbon-concentrating mechanisms, such as inorganic carbon transporters, carboxysomes or pyrenoids, or engineering a full C(4) Kranz pathway using the existing evolutionary progression in C(3)-C(4) intermediates as a blueprint. Possible routes and progress to suppressing photorespiration by introducing C(4) photosynthesis in C(3) crop plants will be discussed, including whether single cell C(4) photosynthesis is feasible, how the evolution of C(3)-C(4) intermediates can be used as a blueprint for engineering C(4) photosynthesis, which pathway for the C(4) cycle might be introduced and the extent to which processes and structures in C(3) plant might require optimisation.","Journal of plant physiology","23245935",2012,"United Kingdom"
"Nandrolone decanoate induces genetic damage in multiple organs of rats.","To evaluate the impact potential of nandrolone decanoate on DNA damage in multiple organs of Wistar rats by means of single-cell gel (comet) assay and micronucleus test. A total of 15 animals were distributed into three groups of five animals each as follows: control group = animal not exposed to nandrolone decanoate; experimental group = animals exposed to nandrolone decanoate for 24 h at 5 mg/kg subcutaneously; and experimental group = animals exposed to nandrolone decanoate for 24 h at 15 mg/kg subcutaneously. Significant statistical differences (p &lt; 0.05) were noted in peripheral blood, liver, and heart cells exposed to nandrolone decanoate at the two doses evaluated. A clear dose-response relationship was observed between groups. Kidney cells showed genetic damage at only the highest dose (15 mg/kg) used. However, micronucleus data did not show remarkable differences among groups. In conclusion, the present study indicates that nandrolone decanoate induces genetic damage in rat blood, liver, heart, and kidney cells as shown by single-cell gel (comet) assay results.","Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology","23223961",2012,"United States"
"Alterations in Purkinje cell GABAA receptor pharmacology following oxygen and glucose deprivation and cerebral ischemia reveal novel contribution of ¦Â1 -subunit-containing receptors.","Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are particularly sensitive to cerebral ischemia, and decreased GABA(A)  receptor function following injury is thought to contribute to PC sensitivity to ischemia-induced excitotoxicity. Here we examined the functional properties of the GABA(A)  receptors that are spared following ischemia in cultured Purkinje cells from rat and in vivo ischemia in mouse. Using subunit-specific positive modulators of GABA(A)  receptors, we observed that oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and cardiac arrest-induced cerebral ischemia cause a decrease in sensitivity to the ¦Â(2/3) -subunit-preferring compound, etomidate. However, sensitivity to propofol, a ¦Â-subunit-acting compound that modulates ¦Â(1-3) -subunits, was not affected by OGD. The ¦Á/¦Ã-subunit-acting compounds, diazepam and zolpidem, were also unaffected by OGD. We performed single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on isolated PCs from acutely dissociated cerebellar tissue and observed that PCs expressed the ¦Â(1) -subunit, contrary to previous reports examining GABA(A)  receptor subunit expression in PCs. GABA(A)  receptor ¦Â(1) -subunit protein was also detected in cultured PCs by western blot and by immunohistochemistry in the adult mouse cerebellum and levels remained unaffected by ischemia. High concentrations of loreclezole (30<U+00A0>¦Ìm) inhibited PC GABA-mediated currents, as previously demonstrated with ¦Â(1) -subunit-containing GABA(A)  receptors expressed in heterologous systems. From our data we conclude that PCs express the ¦Â(1) -subunit and that there is a greater contribution of ¦Â(1) -subunit-containing GABA(A)  receptors following OGD.","The European journal of neuroscience","23176253",2012,"United States"
"Impact of amiodarone and cisapride on simulated human ventricular electrophysiology and electrocardiograms.","AIMS: Amiodarone and cisapride are both known to prolong the QT interval, yet the two drugs have different effects on arrhythmia. Cisapride can cause torsades de pointes while amiodarone is found to be anti-arrhythmic. A computational model was used to investigate the action of these two drugs.METHODS AND RESULTS: In a biophysically detailed model, the ion current conductivities affected by both drugs were reduced in order to simulate the pharmacological effects in healthy and ischaemic cells. Furthermore, restitution curves of the action potential duration (APD), effective refractory period, conduction velocity, wavelength, and the vulnerable window were determined in a one-dimensional (1D) tissue strand. Moreover, cardiac excitation propagation was computed in a 3D model of healthy ventricles. The corresponding body surface potentials were calculated and standard 12-lead electrocardiograms were derived. Both cisapride and amiodarone caused a prolongation of the QT interval and the refractory period. However, cisapride did not significantly alter the conduction-related properties, such as e.g. the wavelength or vulnerable window, whereas amiodarone had a larger impact on them. It slightly flattened the APD restitution slope and furthermore reduced the conduction velocity and wavelength.CONCLUSION: Both drugs show similar prolongation of the QT interval, although they present different electrophysiological properties in the single-cell as well as in tissue simulations of cardiac excitation propagation. These computer simulations help to better understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the initiation or termination of arrhythmias caused by amiodarone and cisapride.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology","23104920",2012,"England"
"Murine and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac bodies form contractile myocardial tissue in vitro.","AIMS: We explored the use of highly purified murine and human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to generate functional bioartificial cardiac tissue (BCT) and investigated the role of fibroblasts, ascorbic acid (AA), and mechanical stimuli on tissue formation, maturation, and functionality.METHODS AND RESULTS: Murine and human embryonic/induced PSC-derived CMs were genetically enriched to generate three-dimensional CM aggregates, termed cardiac bodies (CBs). Addressing the critical limitation of major CM loss after single-cell dissociation, non-dissociated CBs were used for BCT generation, which resulted in a structurally and functionally homogenous syncytium. Continuous in situ characterization of BCTs, for 21 days, revealed that three critical factors cooperatively improve BCT formation and function: both (i) addition of fibroblasts and (ii) ascorbic acid supplementation support extracellular matrix remodelling and CB fusion, and (iii) increasing static stretch supports sarcomere alignment and CM coupling. All factors together considerably enhanced the contractility of murine and human BCTs, leading to a so far unparalleled active tension of 4.4 mN/mm(2) in human BCTs using optimized conditions. Finally, advanced protocols were implemented for the generation of human PSC-derived cardiac tissue using a defined animal-free matrix composition.CONCLUSION: BCT with contractile forces comparable with native myocardium can be generated from enriched, PSC-derived CMs, based on a novel concept of tissue formation from non-dissociated cardiac cell aggregates. In combination with the successful generation of tissue using a defined animal-free matrix, this represents a major step towards clinical applicability of stem cell-based heart tissue for myocardial repair.","European heart journal","23103664",2012,"England"
"Validation and perspectives of a femtosecond laser fabricated monolithic optical stretcher.","The combination of high power laser beams with microfluidic delivery of cells is at the heart of high-throughput, single-cell analysis and disease diagnosis with an optical stretcher. So far, the challenges arising from this combination have been addressed by externally aligning optical fibres with microfluidic glass capillaries, which has a limited potential for integration into lab-on-a-chip environments. Here we demonstrate the successful production and use of a monolithic glass chip for optical stretching of white blood cells, featuring microfluidic channels and optical waveguides directly written into bulk glass by femtosecond laser pulses. The performance of this novel chip is compared to the standard capillary configuration. The robustness, durability and potential for intricate flow patterns provided by this monolithic optical stretcher chip suggest its use for future diagnostic and biotechnological applications.","Biomedical optics express","23082304",2012,"United States"
"The serotonergic central nervous system of the Drosophila larva: anatomy and behavioral function.","The Drosophila larva has turned into a particularly simple model system for studying the neuronal basis of innate behaviors and higher brain functions. Neuronal networks involved in olfaction, gustation, vision and learning and memory have been described during the last decade, often up to the single-cell level. Thus, most of these sensory networks are substantially defined, from the sensory level up to third-order neurons. This is especially true for the olfactory system of the larva. Given the wealth of genetic tools in Drosophila it is now possible to address the question how modulatory systems interfere with sensory systems and affect learning and memory. Here we focus on the serotonergic system that was shown to be involved in mammalian and insect sensory perception as well as learning and memory. Larval studies suggested that the serotonergic system is involved in the modulation of olfaction, feeding, vision and heart rate regulation. In a dual anatomical and behavioral approach we describe the basic anatomy of the larval serotonergic system, down to the single-cell level. In parallel, by expressing apoptosis-inducing genes during embryonic and larval development, we ablate most of the serotonergic neurons within the larval central nervous system. When testing these animals for na<U+00EF>ve odor, sugar, salt and light perception, no profound phenotype was detectable; even appetitive and aversive learning was normal. Our results provide the first comprehensive description of the neuronal network of the larval serotonergic system. Moreover, they suggest that serotonin per se is not necessary for any of the behaviors tested. However, our data do not exclude that this system may modulate or fine-tune a wide set of behaviors, similar to its reported function in other insect species or in mammals. Based on our observations and the availability of a wide variety of genetic tools, this issue can now be addressed.","PloS one","23082175",2012,"United States"
"Quantitative semi-automated analysis of morphogenesis with single-cell resolution in complex embryos.","A quantitative understanding of tissue morphogenesis requires description of the movements of individual cells in space and over time. In transparent embryos, such as C. elegans, fluorescently labeled nuclei can be imaged in three-dimensional time-lapse (4D) movies and automatically tracked through early cleavage divisions up to ~350 nuclei. A similar analysis of later stages of C. elegans development has been challenging owing to the increased error rates of automated tracking of large numbers of densely packed nuclei. We present Nucleitracker4D, a freely available software solution for tracking nuclei in complex embryos that integrates automated tracking of nuclei in local searches with manual curation. Using these methods, we have been able to track &gt;99% of all nuclei generated in the C. elegans embryo. Our analysis reveals that ventral enclosure of the epidermis is accompanied by complex coordinated migration of the neuronal substrate. We can efficiently track large numbers of migrating nuclei in 4D movies of zebrafish cardiac morphogenesis, suggesting that this approach is generally useful in situations in which the number, packing or dynamics of nuclei present challenges for automated tracking.","Development (Cambridge, England)","23052905",2012,"United States"
"[Effects and the mechanisms of cardiac short-term memory on cellular electrical excitability].","Electrical instability easily induces a unidirectional conduction block, resulting in ventricular tachycardia (VT) or even fibrillation (VF). Cardiac memory affects dynamic electrical characteristics through previous pacing so that it makes the memory important in arrhythmia study. This paper investigates the impact of the rapid pacing duration on cellular excitability and its mechanism. Based on the canine endocardial single cell, a one-dimensional tissue model was developed. Simulations were realized with OpenMP parallel programming method. The results showed that with repetitive pacing, the cellular excitability became low while the conduction velocity decreased. Accumulation of intracellular [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i and depletion of [K+]i led to the shift of membrane current-voltage curves, changing the membrane resistance. Excitability determined by the resistance at the large width of stimulus pulse, therefore, it suggested that [Ca2+]i and [K+]i-induced memory formed the ionic substrates for the alteration of excitability.","Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi","23016432",2012,"China"
"Single cell and subcellular measurements of intracellular Ca2<U+207A> concentration.","Increases in bulk average cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) are derived from the combined activities of many Ca(2+) channels. Near (&lt;100 nm) the mouth of each of these channels the local [Ca(2+)](c) rises and falls more quickly and reaches much greater values than occurs in the bulk cytoplasm. Even during apparently uniform, steady-state [Ca(2+)] increases large local inhomogeneities exist near channels. These local increases modulate processes that are sensitive to rapid and large changes in [Ca(2+)] but they cannot easily be visualized with conventional imaging approaches. The [Ca(2+)] changes near channels can be examined using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) to excite fluorophores that lie within 100 nm of the plasma membrane. TIRF is particularly powerful when combined with electrophysiology so that ion channel activity can be related simultaneously to the local subplasma membrane and bulk average [Ca(2+)](c). Together these techniques provide a better understanding of the local modulation and control of Ca(2+) signals.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","23007591",2012,"United Kingdom"
"Human genome-specific real-time PCR method for sensitive detection and reproducible quantitation of human cells in mice.","Xenotransplantation of human cells into immunodeficiency mice has been frequently used to study stem cells in tissue repair and regeneration and cancer cell metastasis. However, a sensitive and reproducible method to quantify cell engraftment lacks. Here, we developed a Real-Time PCR-based method which facilitated consistent detection and quantification of small amounts of human cells distributed in mouse organs after infusion. The principle of the method was to directly detect a humans-specific sequence in the human-murine genomic DNA mixture. In a mouse myocardial infarction model, the Real-Time PCR-based method consistently determined the amounts of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) engrafted into the heart and other organs 7 days after infusion of as little as 2.5 ¡Á 10(5) cells, indicating a high sensitivity, and the amounts of hMSCs detected in mice highly correlated to the numbers of hMSCs transplanted. Importantly, different from previous PCR-based methods, our method produced highly consistent and reproducible results. The reliability of the method was further proven by parallel analyses of DiI-labeled hMSCs in tissue sections and in single cell suspensions of mice. Our data show that the present human genomic DNA-specific primers-based Real-Time PCR method is sensitive and highly reproducible in determining the amount of xenotransplanted human cells in murine tissues.","Stem cell reviews and reports","22983818",2012,"United States"

The method allows serial in vivo fluorescence imaging of the beating heart in live mice in both confocal and nonlinear modes over the course of several hours. We demonstrate the utility of this technique for in vivo optical sectioning and dual-channel time-lapse fluorescence imaging of cardiac ischaemia.

"Iron overload syndrome in the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis): microscopical lesions and comparison with other rhinoceros species.","The African black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) has adapted to a low iron diet during evolution and is thus prone to iron overload in captivity, which is associated with a number of serious disorders. A S88T polymorphism in the HFE gene has been suggested as a potential genetic basis of increased iron uptake in the black rhinoceros, while the Indian rhinoceros is thought to be unaffected by iron overload in captivity. In the present study, the histopathology and distribution of iron accumulations in five black rhinoceroses with iron overload syndrome were characterized and compared with three Indian rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros unicornis) and one African white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). At necropsy examination, iron storage in black rhinoceroses was not associated with gross lesions. Microscopically, the most consistent and highest degree of iron load was found in the spleen, liver, small intestine and lung. There was minimal fibrosis and single cell necrosis in the liver. Endocrine organs, lymph nodes, heart and kidney were less often and less markedly affected. Unexpectedly, Indian rhinoceroses also showed iron load in the spleen and smaller amounts in organs similar to the black rhinoceros except for in the heart, while the white rhinoceros had only minor detectable iron storage in intestine, liver and lung. Sequence analysis confirmed the HFE S88T polymorphism in black but not in Indian rhinoceroses. The results indicate that Indian rhinoceroses may also be affected by iron storage in captivity, although in a milder form than the black rhinoceros, and therefore challenge the relevance of the S88T polymorphism in the HFE gene of black rhinoceroses as the underlying cause for iron overload.","Journal of comparative pathology","22935088",2012,"England"
"Contractility assessment in enzymatically isolated cardiomyocytes.","The use of enzymatically isolated cardiac myocytes is ubiquitous in modern cardiovascular research. Parallels established between cardiomyocyte shortening responses and those of intact tissue make the cardiomyocyte an invaluable experimental model of cardiac function. Much of our understanding regarding the fundamental processes underlying heart function is owed to our increasing capabilities in single-cell stimulation and direct or indirect observation, as well as quantitative analysis of such cells. Of the many important mechanisms and functions that can be readily assessed in cardiomyocytes at all stages of development, contractility is the most representative and one of the most revealing. The purpose of this review is to provide a survey of various methodological approaches in the literature used to assess adult and neonatal cardiomyocyte contractility. The various methods employed to evaluate the contractile behavior of enzymatically isolated mammalian cardiac myocytes can be conveniently divided into two general categories-those employing optical (image)-based systems and those that use transducer-based technologies. This survey is by no means complete, but we have made an effort to include the most popular methods in terms of reliability and accessibility. These techniques are in constant evolution and hold great promise for the next generation of breakthrough studies in cell biology for the prevention, treatment, and cure of cardiovascular diseases.","Biophysical reviews","28510074",2012,"Germany"
"A simple and novel method for RNA-seq library preparation of single cell cDNA analysis by hyperactive Tn5 transposase.","BACKGROUND: Deep sequencing of single cell-derived cDNAs offers novel insights into oncogenesis and embryogenesis. However, traditional library preparation for RNA-seq analysis requires multiple steps with consequent sample loss and stochastic variation at each step significantly affecting output. Thus, a simpler and better protocol is desirable. The recently developed hyperactive Tn5-mediated library preparation, which brings high quality libraries, is likely one of the solutions.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Here, we tested the applicability of hyperactive Tn5-mediated library preparation to deep sequencing of single cell cDNA, optimized the protocol, and compared it with the conventional method based on sonication. This new technique does not require any expensive or special equipment, which secures wider availability. A library was constructed from only 100 ng of cDNA, which enables the saving of precious specimens. Only a few steps of robust enzymatic reaction resulted in saved time, enabling more specimens to be prepared at once, and with a more reproducible size distribution among the different specimens. The obtained RNA-seq results were comparable to the conventional method. Thus, this Tn5-mediated preparation is applicable for anyone who aims to carry out deep sequencing for single cell cDNAs.","Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","22911638",2012,"United Kingdom"
"A new method of ultrasonic nonviral gene delivery to the adult myocardium.","Cardiac gene transfer is a powerful molecular tool to improve our understanding of the role of new proteins and mutants in cardiac pathophysiology. There is a need for a simple efficient myocardial gene delivery technique in order to study the physiological role of proteins in their native environment. Here we tested a new method of myocardial nonviral gene delivery, by using the combination of ultrasound energy (USE), liposomes and high pressure injections to the rat heart. Wistar rats were subjected to intra-myocardial injections of liposomes-DNA or siRNA mix. The heart was exposed after an inter-costal incision, and then injections were conducted between two sets of USE heart exposure. Ultrasound application resulted in much higher transfection efficiency (2% of left ventricle) than the liposomes-DNA alone (0.12% of left ventricle) as shown by the beta-galactosidase staining. The ultrasonic based liposomes-DNA delivery resulted in low inflammatory response, as well as in low cardiac fibrosis as shown by total collagen staining. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that the ultrasonic delivery resulted in cardiac specific transduction. Moreover, 23,906¡À2197 and 71,883¡À4065 calcium tolerant transfected cardiac myocytes were isolated following the delivery of a GFP plasmid or tagged siRNA, respectively. This was sufficient to perform single cell physiological measurements and biochemical experiments on homogenates. We developed an interesting safe method for local gene transfer in the heart using ultrasound and liposomes gene delivery. This method is particularly useful to study the effect of gene transfer on cardiac myocytes maintained in their normal environment in animal models.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","22884737",2012,"England"
"A non-destructive culturing and cell sorting method for cardiomyocytes and neurons using a double alginate layer.","A non-destructive method of collecting cultured cells after identifying their in situ functional characteristics is proposed. In this method, cells are cultivated on an alginate layer in a culture dish and released by spot application of a calcium chelate buffer that locally melts the alginate layer and enables the collection of cultured cells at the single-cell level. Primary hippocampal neurons, beating human embryonic stem (hES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes, and beating hES cell-derived cardiomyocyte clusters cultivated on an alginate layer were successfully released and collected with a micropipette. The collected cells were recultured while maintaining their physiological function, including beating, and elongated neurites. These results suggest that the proposed method may eventually facilitate the transplantation of ES- or iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and neurons differentiated in culture.","PloS one","22870332",2012,"United States"
"Intravital imaging of gastrointestinal diseases in preclinical models using two-photon laser scanning microscopy.","Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), relying on two-photon excitation restricted to the focal plane, has become the gold standard in biomedical research because of its ability to produce high-resolution, higher penetrating imaging of biological materials over an extended duration without an significant photobleaching. Intravital (in vivo) imaging using TPLSM for intra-abdominal organs has long been a technical challenge because of the difficulty of achieving high-quality and higher magnification imaging with acceptable cardiac and respiratory motion artifacts. A method of intravital TPLSM was developed using an organ-stabilizing system for imaging the intra-abdominal organs of green fluorescent protein transgenic mice. This method was further refined for the time-series imaging of intra-abdominal organs in the same mouse model using intravital TPLSM. These procedures allow the observation of not only a single cell or tissue microenvironment at a higher penetrating depth for a longer period of time but also to observe the same organ of the same mouse at multiple time points in preclinical models. This report presents the general principles and properties of TPLSM for biomedical research. In addition, the methods and the usefulness of time-series intravital TPLSM imaging for preclinical gastrointestinal diseases is discussed.","Surgery today","22864975",2012,"Japan"
"Spot identification and quality control in cell-based microarrays.","Cell-based microarrays are being increasingly used as a tool for combinatorial and high throughput screening of cellular microenvironments. Analysis of microarrays requires several steps, including microarray imaging, identification of cell spots, quality control, and data exploration. While high content image analysis, cell counting, and cell pattern recognition methods are established, there is a need for new postprocessing and quality control methods for cell-based microarrays used to investigate combinatorial microenvironments. Previously, microarrayed cell spot identification and quality control were performed manually, leading to excessive processing time and potentially resulting in human bias. This work introduces an automated approach to identify cell-based microarray spots and spot quality control. The approach was used to analyze the adhesion of murine cardiac side population cells on combinatorial arrays of extracellular matrix proteins. Microarrays were imaged by automated fluorescence microscopy and cells were identified using open-source image analysis software (CellProfiler). From these images, clusters of cells making up single cell spots were reliably identified by analyzing the distances between cells using a density-based clustering algorithm (OPTICS). Na<U+00EF>ve Bayesian classifiers trained on manually scored training sets identified good and poor quality spots using spot size, number of cells per spot, and cell location as quality control criteria. Combined, the approach identified 78% of high quality spots and 87% of poor quality spots. Full factorial analysis of the resulting microarray data revealed that collagen IV exhibited the highest positive effect on cell attachment. This data processing approach allows for fast and unbiased analysis of cell-based microarray data.","ACS combinatorial science","22850537",2012,"United States"
"Use of multi-electrode array recordings in studies of network synaptic plasticity in both time and space.","Simultaneous multisite recording using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) in cultured and acutely-dissociated brain slices and other tissues is an emerging technique in the field of network electrophysiology. Over the past 40 years, great efforts have been made by both scientists and commercial concerns, to advance this technique. The MEA technique has been widely applied to many regions of the brain, retina, heart and smooth muscle in various studies at the network level. The present review starts from the development of MEA techniques and their uses in brain preparations, and then specifically concentrates on the use of MEA recordings in studies of synaptic plasticity at the network level in both the temporal and spatial domains. Because the MEA technique helps bridge the gap between single-cell recordings and behavioral assays, its wide application will undoubtedly shed light on the mechanisms underlying brain functions and dysfunctions at the network level that remained largely unknown due to the technical difficulties before it matured.","Neuroscience bulletin","22833039",2012,"Singapore"
"REV-ERB¦Á and the clock gene machinery in mouse peripheral tissues: a possible role as a synchronizing hinge.","Rhythmic oscillations of cellular biological processes are driven by translational-transcriptional feedback loops that realize molecular clocks ticking in every single cell, driven by neural and humoral outputs from the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus that are entrained by environmental photon inputs. The nuclear receptor REV-ERB¦Á has the capability to reset the molecular oscillators of peripheral tissues. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clock gene machinery function in light/dark cycles (LD) and in constant darkness (DD) exploiting in particular the REV-ERB¦Á pattern of expression by using data from two independent experimental settings to reduce procedure related influences. In the LD study C57BL/6 male mice housed on a 12L:12D cycle were sacrificed at 4 h intervals. Liver, kidney, spleen, thymus and testis were harvested and blood was collected. Expression levels of PER1, PER2, CRY1, CRY2, BMAL1, REV-ERB¦Á, CLOCK were evaluated by qRT-PCR. In the DD study Balb/c male mice in the third DD cycle as a continuation of the dark phase of the last LD cycle were sacrificed at 4 h intervals. Lung, heart, liver, stomach, kidney, spleen, and testis were harvested and mRNA expression of PER1, PER2, CRY1, CRY2, BMAL1, REV-ERB¦Á, CLOCK, was evaluated by qRT-PCR. A statistically significant difference was found for the size of the semi-interquartile range of acrophases of clock gene expression in different organs evaluated in LD and DD conditions (4:38<U+2213>1:12h versus 1:16<U+2213>0:10h, p=0.026). A statistically significant difference was found for the acrophases of clock gene expression in different organs evaluated in LD (p=0.01) and in DD (p&lt;0.0001). In LD study only REV-ERB¦Á showed concomitant expression in the different peripheral tissues with the phase peaking around 07:03<U+2213>0.8h. In the DD study all the core clock genes showed concomitant phases in different peripheral mouse tissues and REV-ERB alpha expression peaked around 07:09<U+2213>0.9h. In conclusion, REV-ERB¦Á is the only clock gene that maintains its timing of oscillation in the LD study and in the DD study and its phase of expression remains concomitant in the different mouse peripheral tissues in the presence of LD alternance, or in constant darkness. Oscillation in REV-ERB¦Á ligands (heme, carbon monoxide) may affect not only the phase and amplitude of circadian rhythms, but also physiological outputs of the circadian system and REV-ERBalpha may participate in the entrainment of central and peripheral clocks, functioning as a synchronizing hinge of the clock gene machinery.","Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents","22824754",2012,"Italy"
"Microfluidic single-cell analysis shows that porcine induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells improve myocardial function by paracrine activation.","RATIONALE: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for the development of patient-specific therapies for cardiovascular disease. However, clinical translation will require preclinical optimization and validation of large-animal iPSC models.OBJECTIVE: To successfully derive endothelial cells from porcine iPSCs and demonstrate their potential utility for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.METHODS AND RESULTS: Porcine adipose stromal cells were reprogrammed to generate porcine iPSCs (piPSCs). Immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, microarray hybridization, and angiogenic assays confirmed that piPSC-derived endothelial cells (piPSC-ECs) shared similar morphological and functional properties as endothelial cells isolated from the autologous pig aorta. To demonstrate their therapeutic potential, piPSC-ECs were transplanted into mice with myocardial infarction. Compared with control, animals transplanted with piPSC-ECs showed significant functional improvement measured by echocardiography (fractional shortening at week 4: 27.2¡À1.3% versus 22.3¡À1.1%; P&lt;0.001) and MRI (ejection fraction at week 4: 45.8¡À1.3% versus 42.3¡À0.9%; P&lt;0.05). Quantitative protein assays and microfluidic single-cell PCR profiling showed that piPSC-ECs released proangiogenic and antiapoptotic factors in the ischemic microenvironment, which promoted neovascularization and cardiomyocyte survival, respectively. Release of paracrine factors varied significantly among subpopulations of transplanted cells, suggesting that transplantation of specific cell populations may result in greater functional recovery.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this is the first study to successfully differentiate piPSCs-ECs from piPSCs and demonstrate that transplantation of piPSC-ECs improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction via paracrine activation. Further development of these large animal iPSC models will yield significant insights into their therapeutic potential and accelerate the clinical translation of autologous iPSC-based therapy.","Circulation research","22821929",2012,"United States"
"Oscillation in cycle length induces transient discordant and steady-state concordant alternans in the heart.","Alternans is a beat-to-beat alternation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD) or intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) transient. In cardiac tissue, alternans can be spatially concordant or discordant, of which the latter has been shown to increase dispersion of repolarization and promote a substrate for initiation of ventricular fibrillation. Alternans has been studied almost exclusively under constant cycle length pacing conditions. However, heart rate varies greatly on a beat-by-beat basis in normal and pathological conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine if applying a repetitive but non-constant pacing pattern, specifically cycle length oscillation (CLO), promotes or suppresses a proarrhythmic substrate. We performed computational simulations and optical mapping experiments to investigate the potential consequences of CLO. In a single cell computational model, CLO induced APD and Ca(i) alternans, which became &quot;phase-matched&quot; with the applied oscillation. As a consequence of the phase-matching, in one-dimensional cable simulations, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers, and isolated adult guinea pig hearts CLO could transiently induce spatial and electromechanical discordant alternans followed by a steady-state of concordance. Our results demonstrated that under certain conditions, CLO can initiate ventricular fibrillation in the isolated hearts. On the other hand, CLO can also exert an antiarrhythmic effect by converting an existing state of discordant alternans to concordant alternans.","PloS one","22792346",2012,"United States"
"Funny Current and Cardiac Rhythm: Insights from HCN Knockout and Transgenic Mouse Models.","In the adult animal the sinoatrial node (SAN) rhythmically generates a depolarizing wave that propagates to the rest of the heart. However, the SAN is more than a simple clock; it is a clock that adjusts its pace according to the metabolic requirements of the organism. The Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1-4) are the structural component of the funny (I(f)) channels; in the SAN the I(f) current is the main driving electrical force of the diastolic depolarization and the HCN4 is the most abundant isoform. The generation of HCN KO and transgenic mouse models has advanced the understanding of the role of these channels in cardiac excitability. The HCN4 KO models that were first developed allowed either global or cardiac-specific constitutive ablation of HCN4 channels, and resulted in embryonic lethality. A further progress was made with the development of three separate inducible HCN4 KO models; in one model KO was induced globally in the entire organism, in a second, ablation occurred only in HCN4-expressing cells, and finally in a third model KO was confined to cardiac cells. Unexpectedly, the three models yielded different results; similarities and differences among these models will be presented and discussed. The functional effects of HCN2 and HCN3 knockout models and transgenic HCN4 mouse models will also be discussed. In conclusion, HCN KO/transgenic models have allowed to evaluate the functional role of the I(f) currents in intact animals as well as in single SAN cells isolated from the same animals. This opportunity is therefore unique since it allows (1) to verify the contribution of specific HCN isoforms to cardiac activity in intact animals, and (2) to compare these results to those obtained in single cell experiments. These combined studies were not possible prior to the development of KO models. Finally, these models represent critical tools to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of some inheritable arrhythmic human pathologies.","Frontiers in physiology","22783204",2012,"Switzerland"
"Predominance of heterosubtypic IFN-¦Ã-only-secreting effector memory T cells in pandemic H1N1 naive adults.","The 2009/10 pandemic (pH1N1) highlighted the need for vaccines conferring heterosubtypic immunity against antigenically shifted influenza strains. Although cross-reactive T cells are strong candidates for mediating heterosubtypic immunity, little is known about the population-level prevalence, frequency, and cytokine-secretion profile of heterosubtypic T cells to pH1N1. To assess this, pH1N1 sero-negative adults were recruited. Single-cell IFN-¦Ã and IL-2 cytokine-secretion profiles to internal proteins of pH1N1 or live virus were enumerated and characterised. Heterosubtypic T cells recognising pH1N1 core proteins were widely prevalent, being detected in 90% (30 of 33) of pH1N1-na<U+00EF>ve individuals. Although the last exposure to influenza was greater than 6 months ago, the frequency and proportion of the IFN-¦Ã-only-secreting T-cell subset was significantly higher than the IL-2-only-secreting subset. CD8(+) IFN-¦Ã-only-secreting heterosubtypic T cells were predominantly CCR7(-) CD45RA(-) effector-memory phenotype, expressing the tissue-homing receptor CXCR3 and degranulation marker CD107. Receipt of the 2008-09 influenza vaccine did not alter the frequency of these heterosubtypic T cells, highlighting the inability of current vaccines to maintain this heterosubtypic T-cell pool. The surprisingly high prevalence of pre-existing circulating pH1N1-specific CD8(+) IFN-¦Ã-only-secreting effector memory T cells with cytotoxic and lung-homing potential in pH1N1-seronegative adults may partly explain the low case fatality rate despite high rates of infection of the pandemic in young adults.","European journal of immunology","22777887",2012,"United Kingdom"
"LRP1-dependent endocytic mechanism governs the signaling output of the bmp system in endothelial cells and in angiogenesis.","RATIONALE: Among the extracellular modulators of Bmp (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling, Bmper (Bmp endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator) both enhances and inhibits Bmp signaling. Recently we found that Bmper modulates Bmp4 activity via a concentration-dependent, endocytic trap-and-sink mechanism.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanisms required for endocytosis of the Bmper/Bmp4 and signaling complex and determine the mechanism of Bmper's differential effects on Bmp4 signaling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using an array of biochemical and cell biology techniques, we report that LRP1 (LDL receptor-related protein 1), a member of the LDL receptor family, acts as an endocytic receptor for Bmper and a coreceptor of Bmp4 to mediate the endocytosis of the Bmper/Bmp4 signaling complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LRP1-dependent Bmper/Bmp4 endocytosis is essential for Bmp4 signaling, as evidenced by the phenotype of lrp1-deficient zebrafish, which have abnormal cardiovascular development and decreased Smad1/5/8 activity in key vasculogenic structures.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data reveal a novel role for LRP1 in the regulation of Bmp4 signaling by regulating receptor complex endocytosis. In addition, these data introduce LRP1 as a critical regulator of vascular development. These observations demonstrate Bmper's ability to fine-tune Bmp4 signaling at the single-cell level, unlike the spatial regulatory mechanisms applied by other Bmp modulators.","Circulation research","22777006",2012,"United States"
"Functional single-cell hybridoma screening using droplet-based microfluidics.","Monoclonal antibodies can specifically bind or even inhibit drug targets and have hence become the fastest growing class of human therapeutics. Although they can be screened for binding affinities at very high throughput using systems such as phage display, screening for functional properties (e.g., the inhibition of a drug target) is much more challenging. Typically these screens require the generation of immortalized hybridoma cells, as well as clonal expansion in microtiter plates over several weeks, and the number of clones that can be assayed is typically no more than a few thousand. We present here a microfluidic platform allowing the functional screening of up to 300,000 individual hybridoma cell clones within less than a day. This approach should also be applicable to nonimmortalized primary B-cells, as no cell proliferation is required: Individual cells are encapsulated into aqueous microdroplets and assayed directly for the release of antibodies inhibiting a drug target based on fluorescence. We used this system to perform a model screen for antibodies that inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme 1, a target for hypertension and congestive heart failure drugs. When cells expressing these antibodies were spiked into an unrelated hybridoma cell population in a ratio of 1:10,000 we observed a 9,400-fold enrichment after fluorescence activated droplet sorting. A wide variance in antibody expression levels at the single-cell level within a single hybridoma line was observed and high expressors could be successfully sorted and recultivated.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","22753519",2012,"United States"
"Cell-intrinsic functional effects of the ¦Á-cardiac myosin Arg-403-Gln mutation in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","Human familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common Mendelian cardiovascular disease worldwide. Among the most severe presentations of the disease are those in families heterozygous for the mutation R403Q in ¦Â-cardiac myosin. Mice heterozygous for this mutation in the ¦Á-cardiac myosin isoform display typical familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathology. Here, we study cardiomyocytes from heterozygous 403/+ mice. The effects of the R403Q mutation on force-generating capabilities and dynamics of cardiomyocytes were investigated using a dual carbon nanofiber technique to measure single-cell parameters. We demonstrate the Frank-Starling effect at the single cardiomyocyte level by showing that cell stretch causes an increase in amplitude of contraction. Mutant 403/+ cardiomyocytes exhibit higher end-diastolic and end-systolic stiffness than +/+ cardiomyocytes, whereas active force generation capabilities remain unchanged. Additionally, 403/+ cardiomyocytes show slowed relaxation dynamics. These phenotypes are consistent with increased end-diastolic and end-systolic chamber elastance, as well as diastolic dysfunction seen at the level of the whole heart. Our results show that these functional effects of the R403Q mutation are cell-intrinsic, a property that may be a general phenomenon in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","Biophysical journal","22735528",2012,"United States"
"The role of platelets in athero-thrombotic events.","The crucial role of platelets in primary hemostasis and repair of injured endothelium is well established, as is their role in atherothrombosis. No other single cell type is responsible for as much morbidity and mortality, since death from ischemic heart disease or stroke is by far the leading cause of death worldwide. There is no doubt that our understanding of atherothrombosis has guided current antithrombotic strategies that have dramatically reduced ischemic complications and cardiovascular mortality within the last decades. Yet the rate of ischemic complications after optimal revascularization therapy remains disappointingly high. There is still a strong need for new and smart antiplatelet drugs. The ideal antithrombotic drug would spare physiological platelet function, hemostasis and vascular repair in order to avoid bleeding complications, but would exclusively target the pathological atherothrombotic process. As platelet activity might be determined early in the bone marrow, this review starts with insights into the birth of platelets, describes the essential and primary role of platelets in hemostasis with new evidence in signaling cascades, and closes with the deleterious role of platelets in atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis, with a focus on acute coronary syndromes.","Current pharmaceutical design","22724408",2012,"United Arab Emirates"
"Dual optical biosensors for imaging microRNA-1 during myogenesis.","Dual optical microRNA (miRNA) imaging systems, bioluminescent reporter gene (a signal-off mechanism)- or fluorescent molecular beacon (MB) (a signal-on mechanism)-based miRNA imaging system, have individually allowed us to sense miRNA biogenesis in a noninvasive and iterative manner. Both of these imaging systems have shortcomings with respect to image quality. Therefore, we designed a dual optical imaging systems by simultaneous imaging of a miRNA-1 reporter gene (CMV/Gluc/3xPT_miR-1) and miRNA-1 MB in a single cell to overcome these limitations and used it to visualize miRNA-1, a highly expressed miRNA in cardiac and skeletal muscle. During myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, the bioluminescence intensity from CMV/Gluc/3xPT_miR-1 revealed a miRNA-1-dependent gradual decrease and the fluorescence intensity from miR-1 MB demonstrated a miRNA-1-dependent gradual increase both in vitro and in vivo. The dual miRNA-1 imaging systems, which provides the complementary imaging information about miRNA biogenesis, could be useful to sense miRNA expression during various biologic processes.","Biomaterials","22698721",2012,"Netherlands"
"Contrast agent-free sonoporation: The use of an ultrasonic standing wave microfluidic system for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents.","Sonoporation is a useful biophysical mechanism for facilitating the transmembrane delivery of therapeutic agents from the extracellular to the intracellular milieu. Conventionally, sonoporation is carried out in the presence of ultrasound contrast agents, which are known to greatly enhance transient poration of biological cell membranes. However, in vivo contrast agents have been observed to induce capillary rupture and haemorrhage due to endothelial cell damage and to greatly increase the potential for cell lysis in vitro. Here, we demonstrate sonoporation of cardiac myoblasts in the absence of contrast agent (CA-free sonoporation) using a low-cost ultrasound-microfluidic device. Within this device an ultrasonic standing wave was generated, allowing control over the position of the cells and the strength of the acoustic radiation forces. Real-time single-cell analysis and retrospective post-sonication analysis of insonated cardiac myoblasts showed that CA-free sonoporation induced transmembrane transfer of fluorescent probes (CMFDA and FITC-dextran) and that different mechanisms potentially contribute to membrane poration in the presence of an ultrasonic wave. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we have shown for the first time that sonoporation induces increased cell cytotoxicity as a consequence of CA-free ultrasound-facilitated uptake of pharmaceutical agents (doxorubicin, luteolin, and apigenin). The US-microfluidic device designed here provides an in vitro alternative to expensive and controversial in vivo models used for early stage drug discovery, and drug delivery programs and toxicity measurements.","Biomicrofluidics","22662060",2012,"United States"
"Interventricular heterogeneity as a substrate for arrhythmogenesis of decoupled mitochondria during ischemia in the whole heart.","Myocardial ischemia results in metabolic changes, which collapse the mitochondrial network, that increase the vulnerability of the heart to ventricular fibrillation (VF). It has been demonstrated at the single cell level that uncoupling the mitochondria using carbonyl cyanide p-(tri-fluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) at low concentrations can be cardioprotective. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of FCCP on arrhythmogenesis during ischemia in the whole rabbit heart. We performed optical mapping of isolated rabbit hearts (n = 33) during control and 20 min of global ischemia and reperfusion, both with and without pretreatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP at 100, 50, or 30 nM. No hearts went into VF during ischemia under the control condition, with or without the electromechanical uncoupler blebbistatin. We found that pretreatment with 100 (n = 4) and 50 (n = 6) nM FCCP, with or without blebbistatin, leads to VF during ischemia in all hearts, whereas pretreatment with 30 nM of FCCP led to three out of eight hearts going into VF during ischemia. We demonstrated that 30 nM of FCCP significantly increased interventricular (but not intraventricular) action potential duration and conduction velocity heterogeneity in the heart during ischemia, thus providing the substrate for VF. We showed that wavebreaks during VF occurred between the right and left ventricular junction. We also demonstrated that no VF occurred in the heart pretreated with 10 ¦ÌM glibenclamide, which is known to abolish interventricular heterogeneity. Our results indicate that low concentrations of FCCP, although cardioprotective at the single cell level, are arrhythmogenic at the whole heart level. This is due to the fact that FCCP induces different electrophysiological changes to the right and left ventricle, thus increasing interventricular heterogeneity and providing the substrate for VF.","American journal of physiology.

"An analysis of deformation-dependent electromechanical coupling in the mouse heart.","To investigate the effects of the coupling between excitation and contraction on whole-organ function, we have developed a novel biophysically based multiscale electromechanical model of the murine heart. Through comparison with a comprehensive in vivo experimental data set, we show good agreement with pressure and volume measurements at both physiological temperatures and physiological pacing frequencies. This whole-organ model was used to investigate the effects of material and haemodynamic properties introduced at the tissue level, as well as emergent function of our novel cell contraction model. Through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis at both the cellular and whole organ level, we demonstrate the sensitivity of the model's results to its parameters and the constraining effect of experimental data. These results demonstrate the fundamental importance of length- and velocity-dependent feedback to the cellular scale for whole-organ function, and we show that a strong velocity dependence of tension is essential for explaining the differences between measured single cell tension and whole-organ pressure transients.","The Journal of physiology","22615436",2012,"United Kingdom"
"Force field evolution during human blood platelet activation.","Contraction at the cellular level is vital for living organisms. The most prominent type of contractile cells are heart muscle cells, a less-well-known example is blood platelets. Blood platelets activate and interlink at injured blood vessel sites, finally contracting to form a compact blood clot. They are ideal model cells to study the mechanisms of cellular contraction, as they are simple, having no nucleus, and their activation can be triggered and synchronized by the addition of thrombin. We have studied contraction using human blood platelets, employing traction force microscopy, a single-cell technique that enables time-resolved measurements of cellular forces on soft substrates with elasticities in the physiological range (¡«4 kPa). We found that platelet contraction reaches a steady state after 25 min with total forces of ¡«34 nN. These forces are considerably larger than what was previously reported for platelets in aggregates, demonstrating the importance of a single-cell approach for studies of platelet contraction. Compared with other contractile cells, we find that platelets are unique, because force fields are nearly isotropic, with forces pointing toward the center of the cell area.","Journal of cell science","22582082",2012,"England"
"How cells process information: quantification of spatiotemporal signaling dynamics.","Arguably, one of the foremost distinctions between life and non-living matter is the ability to sense environmental changes and respond appropriately--an ability that is invested in every living cell. Within a single cell, this function is largely carried out by networks of signaling molecules. However, the details of how signaling networks help cells make complicated decisions are still not clear. For instance, how do cells read graded, analog stress signals but convert them into digital live-or-die responses? The answer to such questions may originate from the fact that signaling molecules are not static but dynamic entities, changing in numbers and activity over time and space. In the past two decades, researchers have been able to experimentally monitor signaling dynamics and use mathematical techniques to quantify and abstract general principles of how cells process information. In this review, the authors first introduce and discuss various experimental and computational methodologies that have been used to study signaling dynamics. The authors then discuss the different types of temporal dynamics such as oscillations and bistability that can be exhibited by signaling systems and highlight studies that have investigated such dynamics in physiological settings. Finally, the authors illustrate the role of spatial compartmentalization in regulating cellular responses with examples of second-messenger signaling in cardiac myocytes.","Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society","22573643",2012,"United States"
"Simultaneous voltage and calcium mapping of genetically purified human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocyte monolayers.","RATIONALE: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) offer a powerful in vitro tool to investigate disease mechanisms and to perform patient-specific drug screening. To date, electrophysiological analysis of iPSC-CMs has been limited to single-cell recordings or low-resolution microelectrode array mapping of small cardiomyocyte aggregates. New methods of generating and optically mapping impulse propagation of large human iPSC-CM cardiac monolayers are needed.OBJECTIVE: Our first aim was to develop an imaging platform with versatility for multiparameter electrophysiological mapping of cardiac preparations, including human iPSC-CM monolayers. Our second aim was to create large electrically coupled human iPSC-CM monolayers for simultaneous action potential and calcium wave propagation measurements.METHODS AND RESULTS: A fluorescence imaging platform based on electronically controlled light-emitting diode illumination, a multiband emission filter, and single camera sensor was developed and utilized to monitor simultaneously action potential and intracellular calcium wave propagation in cardiac preparations. Multiple, large-diameter (¡Ý1 cm), electrically coupled human cardiac monolayers were then generated that propagated action potentials and calcium waves at velocities similar to those commonly observed in rodent cardiac monolayers.CONCLUSIONS: The multiparametric imaging system presented here offers a scalable enabling technology to measure simultaneously action potential and intracellular calcium wave amplitude and dynamics of cardiac monolayers. The advent of large-scale production of human iPSC-CMs makes it possible to now generate sufficient numbers of uniform cardiac monolayers that can be utilized for the study of arrhythmia mechanisms and offers advantages over commonly used rodent models.","Circulation research","22570367",2012,"United States"
"Portal application of human unrestricted somatic stem cells to support hepatic regeneration after portal embolization and tumor surgery.","Insufficient liver remnant volume still precludes patients with potentially resectable tumors from curative surgery. Clinically, it has been demonstrated that transplanted adult stem cells promote liver regeneration. However, the mechanisms of the observed functional improvements are unknown. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of transplanted human multipotent cord blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) on liver regeneration and identify the underlying mechanisms in an ovine model. We performed partial embolization of the right liver lobe and grafted USSC in the portal venous system of the left liver lobe. After 4 weeks, livers were explanted and analyzed for differentiation of USSC into hepatocytes by histopathologic examination and for fusion of USSC with recipient hepatocytes by single-cell polymerase chain reaction. The studies revealed that transplanted USSC differentiate into hepatocytes and produce human albumin. No ovine DNA was found in the hepatocytes with a human phenotype. Transplantation of USSC enhances the number of viable hepatocytes in liver disease by differentiation and opens new therapeutic perspectives.","ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)","22543756",2012,"United States"
"Pulmonary artery endothelium resident endothelial colony-forming cells in pulmonary arterial hypertension.","Proliferative pulmonary vascular remodeling is the pathologic hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that ultimately leads to right heart failure and death. Highly proliferative endothelial cells known as endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) participate in vascular homeostasis in health as well as in pathological angiogenic remodeling in disease. ECFC are distinguished by the capacity to clonally proliferate from a single cell. The presence of ECFC in the human pulmonary arteries and their role in PAH pathogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we established a simple technique for isolating and growing ECFC from cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) to test the hypothesis that ECFC reside in human pulmonary arteries and that the proliferative vasculopathy of PAH is related to greater numbers and/or more proliferative ECFC in the pulmonary vascular wall. Flow cytometric forward and side scatter properties and aggregate correction were utilized to sort unmanipulated, single PAEC to enumerate ECFC in primary PAEC cultures derived from PAH and healthy lungs. After 2 weeks, wells were assessed for ECFC formation. ECFC derived from PAH PAEC were more proliferative than control. A greater proportion of PAH ECFC formed colonies following subculturing, demonstrating the presence of more ECFC with high proliferative potential among PAH PAEC. Human androgen receptor assay showed clonality of progeny, confirming that proliferative colonies were single cell-derived. ECFC expressed CD31, von Willebrand factor, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, caveolin-1 and CD34, consistent with an endothelial cell phenotype. We established a simple flow cytometry method that allows ECFC quantification using unmanipulated cells. We conclude that ECFC reside among PAEC and that PAH PAEC contain ECFC that are more proliferative than ECFC in control cultures, which likely contributes to the proliferative angiopathic process in PAH.","Pulmonary circulation","22530103",2012,"United States"
"Pretreatment with nonselective cationic channel inhibitors blunts the PACAP-induced increase in guinea pig cardiac neuron excitability.","Calcium influx is required for the pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP)-induced increase in guinea pig cardiac neuron excitability, noted as a change from a phasic to multiple action potential firing pattern. Intracellular recordings indicated that pretreatment with the nonselective cationic channel inhibitors, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB), 1-[¦Â-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole HCl (SKF 96365), and flufenamic acid (FFA) reduced the 20-nM PACAP-induced excitability increase. Additional experiments tested whether 2-APB, FFA, and SKF 96365 could suppress the increase in excitability by PACAP once it had developed. The increased action potential firing remained following application of 2-APB but was diminished by FFA. SKF 96365 transiently depressed the PACAP-induced excitability increase. A decrease and recovery of action potential amplitude paralleled the excitability shift. Since semiquantitative PCR indicated that cardiac neurons express TRPC subunit transcripts, we hypothesize that PACAP activates calcium-permeable, nonselective cationic channels, which possibly are members of the TRPC family. Our results are consistent with calcium influx being required for the initiation of the PACAP-induced increase in excitability, but suggest that it may not be required to sustain the peptide effect. The present results also demonstrate that nonselective cationic channel inhibitors could have other actions, which might contribute to the inhibition of the PACAP-induced excitability increase.","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","22528456",2012,"United States"
"Suspension culture of human pluripotent stem cells in controlled, stirred bioreactors.","Therapeutic and industrial applications of pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives require large cell quantities generated in defined conditions. To this end, we have translated single cell-inoculated suspension cultures of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs; including human induced pluripotent stem cells [hiPS] and human embryonic stem cells [hESC]) to stirred tank bioreactors. These systems that are widely used in biopharmaceutical industry allow straightforward scale up and detailed online monitoring of key process parameters. To ensure minimum medium consumption, but in parallel functional integration of all probes mandatory for process monitoring, that is, for pO<U+2082> and pH, experiments were performed in 100<U+2009>mL culture volume in a &quot;mini reactor platform&quot; consisting of four independently controlled vessels. By establishing defined parameters for tightly controlled cell inoculation and aggregate formation up to 2¡Á10<U+2078> hiPSCs/100<U+2009>mL were generated in a single process run in 7 days. Expression of pluripotency markers and ability of cells to differentiate into derivates of all three germ layers in vitro was maintained, underlining practical utility of this new process. The presented data provide key steps toward scalable mass expansion of human iPS and ES cells thereby enabling translation of stem cell research to (pre)clinical application in relevant large animal models and valuable in vitro assays for drug development and validation as well.","Tissue engineering.

"Growth hormone secretagogues protect mouse cardiomyocytes from in vitro ischemia/reperfusion injury through regulation of intracellular calcium.","BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of mortality. To study this disease, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) models are widely used to mimic the process of transient blockage and subsequent recovery of cardiac coronary blood supply. We aimed to determine whether the presence of the growth hormone secretagogues, ghrelin and hexarelin, would protect/improve the function of heart from I/R injury and to examine the underlying mechanisms.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Isolated hearts from adult male mice underwent 20 min global ischemia and 30 min reperfusion using a Langendorff apparatus. Ghrelin (10 nM) or hexarelin (1 nM) was introduced into the perfusion system either 10 min before or after ischemia, termed pre- and post-treatments. In freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from these hearts, single cell shortening, intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients and caffeine-releasable sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) were measured. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blots were used to examine the expression level of GHS receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a), and phosphorylated phospholamban (p-PLB), respectively. Ghrelin and hexarelin pre- or post-treatments prevented the significant reduction in the cell shortening, [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude and caffeine-releasable SR Ca(2+) content after I/R through recovery of p-PLB. GHS-R1a antagonists, [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (200 nM) and BIM28163 (100 nM), completely blocked the effects of GHS on both cell shortening and [Ca(2+)](i) transients.SIGNIFICANCE: Through activation of GHS-R1a, ghrelin and hexarelin produced a positive inotropic effect on ischemic cardiomyocytes and protected them from I/R injury probably by protecting or recovering p-PLB (and therefore SR Ca(2+) content) to allow the maintenance or recovery of normal cardiac contractility. These observations provide supporting evidence for the potential therapeutic application of ghrelin and hexarelin in patients with cardiac I/R injury.","PloS one","22493744",2012,"United States"
"Enhanced sensitivity of aged fibrotic hearts to angiotensin II- and hypokalemia-induced early afterdepolarization-mediated ventricular arrhythmias.","Unlike young hearts, aged hearts are highly susceptible to early afterdepolarization (EAD)-mediated ventricular fibrillation (VF). This differential may result from age-related structural remodeling (fibrosis) or electrical remodeling of ventricular myocytes or both. We used optical mapping and microelectrode recordings in Langendorff-perfused hearts and patch-clamp recordings in isolated ventricular myocytes from aged (24-26 mo) and young (3-4 mo) rats to assess susceptibility to EADs and VF during either oxidative stress with ANG II (2 ¦ÌM) or ionic stress with hypokalemia (2.7 mM). ANG II caused EAD-mediated VF in 16 of 19 aged hearts (83%) after 32 ¡À 7 min but in 0 of 9 young hearts (0%). ANG II-mediated VF was suppressed with KN-93 (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor) and the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine. Hypokalemia caused EAD-mediated VF in 11 of 11 aged hearts (100%) after 7.4 ¡À 0.4 min. In 14 young hearts, however, VF did not occur in 6 hearts (43%) or was delayed in onset (31 ¡À 22 min, P &lt; 0.05) in 8 hearts (57%). In patch-clamped myocytes, ANG II and hypokalemia (n = 6) induced EADs and triggered activity in both age groups (P = not significant) at a cycle length of &gt;0.5 s. When myocytes of either age group were coupled to a virtual fibroblast using the dynamic patch-clamp technique, EADs arose in both groups at a cycle length of &lt;0.5 s. Aged ventricles had significantly greater fibrosis and reduced connexin43 gap junction density compared with young hearts. The lack of differential age-related sensitivity at the single cell level in EAD susceptibility indicates that increased ventricular fibrosis in the aged heart plays a key role in increasing vulnerability to VF induced by oxidative and ionic stress.","American journal of physiology.

"Unidirectional pinning and hysteresis of spatially discordant alternans in cardiac tissue.","Spatially discordant alternans is a widely observed pattern of voltage and calcium signals in cardiac tissue that can precipitate lethal cardiac arrhythmia. Using spatially coupled iterative maps of the beat-to-beat dynamics, we explore this pattern's dynamics in the regime of a calcium-dominated period-doubling instability at the single-cell level. We find a novel nonlinear bifurcation associated with the formation of a discontinuous jump in the amplitude of calcium alternans at nodes separating discordant regions. We show that this jump unidirectionally pins nodes by preventing their motion away from the pacing site following a pacing rate decrease but permitting motion towards this site following a rate increase. This unidirectional pinning leads to strongly history-dependent node motion that is strongly arrhythmogenic.","Physical review letters","22463458",2012,"United States"
"The hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system: from genome to physiology.","The elucidation of the genomes of a large number of mammalian species has produced a huge amount of data on which to base physiological studies. These endeavours have also produced surprises, not least of which has been the revelation that the number of protein coding genes needed to make a mammal is only 22 333 (give or take). However, this small number belies an unanticipated complexity that has only recently been revealed as a result of genomic studies. This complexity is evident at a number of levels: (i) cis-regulatory sequences; (ii) noncoding and antisense mRNAs, most of which have no known function; (iii) alternative splicing that results in the generation of multiple, subtly different mature mRNAs from the precursor transcript encoded by a single gene; and (iv) post-translational processing and modification. In this review, we examine the steps being taken to decipher genome complexity in the context of gene expression, regulation and function in the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system (HNS). Five unique stories explain: (i) the use of transcriptomics to identify genes involved in the response to physiological (dehydration) and pathological (hypertension) cues; (ii) the use of mass spectrometry for single-cell level identification of biological active peptides in the HNS, and to measure in vitro release; (iii) the use of transgenic lines that express fusion transgenes enabling (by cross-breeding) the generation of double transgenic lines that can be used to study vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) neurones in the HNS, as well as their neuroanatomy, electrophysiology and activation upon exposure to any given stimulus; (iv) the use of viral vectors to demonstrate that somato-dendritically released AVP plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis by binding to V1a receptors on local somata and dendrites; and (v) the use of virally-mediated optogenetics to dissect the role of OXT and AVP in the modulation of a wide variety of behaviours.","Journal of neuroendocrinology","22448850",2012,"United Kingdom"
"Derivation, expansion and differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells in continuous suspension cultures.","We describe derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from terminally differentiated mouse cells in serum- and feeder-free stirred suspension cultures. Temporal analysis of global gene expression revealed high correlations between cells reprogrammed in suspension and cells reprogrammed in adhesion-dependent conditions. Suspension culture-reprogrammed iPSCs (SiPSCs) could be differentiated into all three germ layers in vitro and contributed to chimeric embryos in vivo. SiPSC generation allowed for efficient selection of reprogramming factor-expressing cells based on their differential survival and proliferation in suspension culture. Seamless integration of SiPSC reprogramming and directed differentiation enabled scalable production of beating cardiac cells in a continuous single cell- and small aggregate-based process.

"Nesfatin-1 influences the excitability of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract and regulates cardiovascular function.","Nesfatin-1 has been identified as one of the most potent centrally acting anorexigenic peptides, and it has also been shown to play important roles in the control of cardiovascular function. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have revealed the expression of nesfatin-1 throughout the brain and, in particular, in the medullary autonomic gateway known as the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The present study was thus undertaken to explore the cellular correlates and functional roles of nesfatin-1 actions in the medial NTS (mNTS). Using current-clamp electrophysiology recordings from mNTS neurons in slice preparation, we show that bath-applied nesfatin-1 directly influences the excitability of the majority of mNTS neurons by eliciting either depolarizing (42%, mean: 7.8 ¡À 0.8 mV) or hyperpolarizing (21%, mean: -8. 2 ¡À 1.0 mV) responses. These responses were observed in all electrophysiologically defined cell types in the NTS and were site specific and concentration dependent. Furthermore, post hoc single cell reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction revealed a depolarizing action of nesfatin-1 on NPY and nucleobindin-2-expressing mNTS neurons. We have also correlated these actions of nesfatin-1 on neuronal membrane potential with physiological outcomes, using in vivo microinjection techniques to demonstrate that nesfatin-1 microinjected into the mNTS induces significant increases in both blood pressure (mean AUC = 3354.1 ¡À 750.7 mmHg¡¤s, n = 6) and heart rate (mean AUC = 164.8 ¡À 78.5 beats, n = 6) in rats. Our results provide critical insight into the circuitry and physiology involved in the profound effects of nesfatin-1 and highlight the NTS as a key structure mediating these autonomic actions.","American journal of physiology.

"Carbon nanotubes promote growth and spontaneous electrical activity in cultured cardiac myocytes.","Nanoscale manipulations of the extracellular microenvironment are increasingly attracting attention in tissue engineering. Here, combining microscopy, biological, and single-cell electrophysiological methodologies, we demonstrate that neonatal rat ventricular myocytes cultured on substrates of multiwall carbon nanotubes interact with carbon nanotubes by forming tight contacts and show increased viability and proliferation. Furthermore, we observed changes in the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes, suggesting that carbon nanotubes are able to promote cardiomyocyte maturation.","Nano letters","22432413",2012,"United States"
"Quantitatively analyzing the protective effect of mesenchymal stem cells on cardiomyocytes in single-cell biochips.","To understand how stem cells benefit native cardiomyocytes is crucial for cell-based therapies to rescue cardiomyocytes (CMCs) damaged during heart infarction and other cardiac diseases. However, the current conclusions on the protective effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained by analyzing the overall amount of protein and factor secretion in a conventional co-culture system. These results neglected the heterogeneity of MSC population and failed to determine the importance of cellular contact to the protective effects. To address these issues, we have constructed two biochips by microfabrication methods and laser-guided cell micropatterning technique. Using the biochips, the protective effect of MSCs on CMCs can be quantitatively analyzed at single-cell level with defined cellular contact. The role of cellular contact on protective effect can be clarified according to our statistical results.","Biotechnology letters","22426842",2012,"United States"
"Mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations in adult mouse cardiac side population cells.","We investigated the presence and potential role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion mutations in adult cardiac stem cells. Cardiac side population (SP) cells were isolated from 12-week-old mice. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen for the presence of mtDNA deletion mutations in (a) freshly isolated SP cells and (b) SP cells cultured to passage 10. When present, the abundance of mtDNA deletion mutation was analyzed in single cell colonies. The effect of different levels of deletion mutations on SP cell growth and differentiation was determined. MtDNA deletion mutations were found in both freshly isolated and cultured cells from 12-week-old mice. While there was no significant difference in the number of single cell colonies with mtDNA deletion mutations from any of the groups mentioned above, the abundance of mtDNA deletion mutations was significantly higher in the cultured cells, as determined by quantitative PCR. Within a single clonal cell population, the detectable mtDNA deletion mutations were the same in all cells and unique when compared to deletions of other colonies. We also found that cells harboring high levels of mtDNA deletion mutations (i.e. where deleted mtDNA comprised more than 60% of total mtDNA) had slower proliferation rates and decreased differentiation capacities. Screening cultured adult stem cells for mtDNA deletion mutations as a routine assessment will benefit the biomedical application of adult stem cells.","Mutation research","22426178",2012,"Netherlands"
"Abnormal termination of Ca2+ release is a common defect of RyR2 mutations associated with cardiomyopathies.","RATIONALE: Naturally occurring mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been associated with both cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. It is clear that delayed afterdepolarization resulting from abnormal activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release is the primary cause of RyR2-associated cardiac arrhythmias. However, the mechanism underlying RyR2-associated cardiomyopathies is completely unknown.OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigate the role of the NH2-terminal region of RyR2 in and the impact of a number of cardiomyopathy-associated RyR2 mutations on the termination of Ca2+ release.METHODS AND RESULTS: The 35-residue exon-3 region of RyR2 is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Single-cell luminal Ca2+ imaging revealed that the deletion of the first 305 NH2-terminal residues encompassing exon-3 or the deletion of exon-3 itself markedly reduced the luminal Ca2+ threshold at which Ca2+ release terminates and increased the fractional Ca2+ release. Single-cell cytosolic Ca2+ imaging also showed that both RyR2 deletions enhanced the amplitude of store overload-induced Ca2+ transients in HEK293 cells or HL-1 cardiac cells. Furthermore, the RyR2 NH2-terminal mutations, A77V, R176Q/T2504M, R420W, and L433P, which are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular displasia type 2, also reduced the threshold for Ca2+ release termination and increased fractional release. The RyR2 A1107M mutation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had the opposite action (i.e., increased the threshold for Ca2+ release termination and reduced fractional release).CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that the NH2-terminal region of RyR2 is an important determinant of Ca2+ release termination, and that abnormal fractional Ca2+ release attributable to aberrant termination of Ca2+ release is a common defect in RyR2-associated cardiomyopathies.","Circulation research","22374134",2012,"United States"
"[Expression of Kir2.1, SCN5a and SCN1b channel genes in mouse cardiomyocytes with various electric properties: patch clamp combined with single cell RT-PCR study].","This study is to explore a new method of investigating molecular basis for electrophysiological properties of early fetal cardiomyocytes. Single embryonic cardiomyocytes of mouse early developmental heart (E10.5) were obtained by a collagenase B digestion approach. After recording spontaneous action potential using whole cell patch clamp technique, the single cell was picked by a glass micropipette, followed by a standard RT-PCR to explore the expression levels of several ion channel genes. Three phenotypes of cardiomyocytes were demonstrated with distinct properties: ventricular-like, atrial-like, and pacemaker-like action potentials. Ventricular-like and atrial-like cells were characterized with much negative maximum diastolic potential (MDP) and a higher V(max) (maximum velocity of depolarization) compared to pacemaker-like cells. MDP of ventricular-like cells was the most negative. In parallel, stronger expression of SCN5a, SCN1b and Kir2.1 were observed in ventricular-like and atrial-like cells compared to that of pacemaker-like cells, where Kir2.1 in ventricular-like cells was the most abundant. Cardiomyocytes with distinct electrophysiological properties had distinct gene expression pattern. Single cell RT-PCR combined with patch clamp technique could serve as a precise detector to analyze the molecular basis of the special electrophysiological characteristics of cardiomyocytes.","Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica]","22348965",2012,"China"
"High-frequency electrical stimulation of cardiac cells and application to artifact reduction.","A novel modality for the electrical stimulation of cardiac cells is described. The technique is based on HF stimulation-burst of HF (1-25 kHz) biphasic square waves-to depolarize the cells and trigger action potentials (APs). HF stimulation was demonstrated in HL-1 cardiomyocyte cultures using microelectrode arrays, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated using single-cell model simulations. Current thresholds for HF stimulation increased at higher frequencies or shorter burst durations, and were typically higher than thresholds for single biphasic pulses. Nonetheless, owing to the decreasing impedance of metal electrodes with increasing frequencies, HF bursts resulted in reduced electrode voltages (up to four fold). Such lowered potentials might be beneficial in reducing the probability of irreversible electrochemical reactions and tissue damage, especially for long-term stimulation. More significantly, stimulation at frequencies higher than the upper limit of the AP power spectrum allows effective artifact reduction by low-pass filtering. Shaping of the burst envelope provides further reduction of the remaining artifact. This ability to decouple extracellular stimulation and recording in the frequency domain allowed detection of APs during stimulation-something previously not achievable to the best of our knowledge.","IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering","22345525",2012,"United States"
"Single-cell recording and stimulation with a 16k micro-nail electrode array integrated on a 0.18 ¦Ìm CMOS chip.","To cope with the growing needs in research towards the understanding of cellular function and network dynamics, advanced micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) based on integrated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits have been increasingly reported. Although such arrays contain a large number of sensors for recording and/or stimulation, the size of the electrodes on these chips are often larger than a typical mammalian cell. Therefore, true single-cell recording and stimulation remains challenging. Single-cell resolution can be obtained by decreasing the size of the electrodes, which inherently increases the characteristic impedance and noise. Here, we present an array of 16,384 active sensors monolithically integrated on chip, realized in 0.18 ¦Ìm CMOS technology for recording and stimulation of individual cells. Successful recording of electrical activity of cardiac cells with the chip, validated with intracellular whole-cell patch clamp recordings are presented, illustrating single-cell readout capability. Further, by applying a single-electrode stimulation protocol, we could pace individual cardiac cells, demonstrating single-cell addressability. This novel electrode array could help pave the way towards solving complex interactions of mammalian cellular networks.","Lab on a chip","22337001",2012,"England"
"Curvature-Dependent Excitation Propagation in Cultured Cardiac Tissue.","The geometry of excitation wave front may play an important role on the propagation block and spiral wave formation. The wave front which is bent over the critical value due to interaction with the obstacles may partially cease to propagate and appearing wave breaks evolve into rotating waves or reentry. This scenario may explain how reentry spontaneously originates in a heart. We studied highly curved excitation wave fronts in the cardiac tissue culture and found that in the conditions of normal, non-inhibited excitability the curvature effects do not play essential role in the propagation. Neither narrow isthmuses nor sharp corners of the obstacles, being classical objects for production of extremely curved wave front, affect non-inhibited wave propagation. The curvature-related phenomena of the propagation block and wave detachment from the obstacle boundary were observed only after partial suppression of the sodium channels with Lidocaine. Computer simulations confirmed the experimental observations. The explanation of the observed phenomena refers to the fact that the heart tissue is made of finite size cells so that curvature radii smaller than the cardiomyocyte size loses sense, and in non-inhibited tissue the single cell is capable to transmit excitation to its neighbors.","JETP letters","26705369",2012,"United States"
"Exercise preconditioning modulates genotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in multiple organs of rats.","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise in multiple organs of rats treated with doxorubicin. Male adult Wistar rats were distributed into the following groups: sedentary + NaCl; exercise + NaCl; sedentary + doxorubicin; and exercise + doxorubicin. Animals were sacrificed 2 days following injections. Central fragments from heart, liver, and kidney were collected and minced in 0.9% NaCl being cellular suspensions used for the single-cell gel (comet) assay. The results showed that exercise was able to prevent genotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in heart cells. By contrast, exercise was not able to prevent genotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in liver cells. The same occurred to kidney cells, i.e. no statistically significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were found when compared with groups not exposed to doxorubicin. Taken together, our results support the idea that exercise could contribute to the protective effect against genotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in heart cells.","Cell biochemistry and function","22287211",2012,"England"
"Sca-1+ cardiosphere-derived cells are enriched for Isl1-expressing cardiac precursors and improve cardiac function after myocardial injury.","BACKGROUND: Endogenous cardiac progenitor cells are a promising option for cell-therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). However, obtaining adequate numbers of cardiac progenitors after MI remains a challenge. Cardiospheres (CSs) have been proposed to have cardiac regenerative properties; however, their cellular composition and how they may be influenced by the tissue milieu remains unclear.PRINCIPAL FINDING: Using &quot;middle aged&quot; mice as CSs donors, we found that acute MI induced a dramatic increase in the number of CSs in a mouse model of MI, and this increase was attenuated back to baseline over time. We also observed that CSs from post-MI hearts engrafted in ischemic myocardium induced angiogenesis and restored cardiac function. To determine the role of Sca-1(+)CD45(-) cells within CSs, we cloned these from single cell isolates. Expression of Islet-1 (Isl1) in Sca-1(+)CD45(-) cells from CSs was 3-fold higher than in whole CSs. Cloned Sca-1(+)CD45(-) cells had the ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in vitro. We also observed that cloned cells engrafted in ischemic myocardium induced angiogenesis, differentiated into endothelial and smooth muscle cells and improved cardiac function in post-MI hearts.SIGNIFICANCE: These studies demonstrate that cloned Sca-1(+)CD45(-) cells derived from CSs from infarcted &quot;middle aged&quot; hearts are enriched for second heart field (i.e., Isl-1(+)) precursors that give rise to both myocardial and vascular tissues, and may be an appropriate source of progenitor cells for autologous cell-therapy post-MI.","PloS one","22272337",2012,"United States"
"Single cell transcriptional profiling of adult mouse cardiomyocytes.","While numerous studies have examined gene expression changes from homogenates of heart tissue, this prevents studying the inherent stochastic variation between cells within a tissue.  Isolation of pure cardiomyocyte populations through a collagenase perfusion of mouse hearts facilitates the generation of single cell microarrays for whole transcriptome gene expression, or qPCR of specific targets using nanofluidic arrays.  We describe here a procedure to examine single cell gene expression profiles of cardiomyocytes isolated from the heart.  This paradigm allows for the evaluation of metrics of interest which are not reliant on the mean (for example variance between cells within a tissue) which is not possible when using conventional whole tissue workflows for the evaluation of gene expression (Figure 1).  We have achieved robust amplification of the single cell transcriptome yielding micrograms of double stranded cDNA that facilitates the use of microarrays on individual cells. In the procedure we describe the use of NimbleGen arrays which were selected for their ease of use and ability to customize their design.   Alternatively, a reverse transcriptase - specific target amplification (RT-STA) reaction, allows for qPCR of hundreds of targets by nanofluidic PCR.  Using either of these approaches, it is possible to examine the variability of expression between cells, as well as examining expression profiles of rare cell types from within a tissue.  Overall, the single cell gene expression approach allows for the generation of data that can potentially identify idiosyncratic expression profiles that are typically averaged out when examining expression of millions of cells from typical homogenates generated from whole tissues.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","22231655",2012,"United States"
"Quantification of myocyte chemotaxis: a role for FAK in regulating directional motility.","Formation of a fully functional four-chambered heart involves an intricate and complex series of events that includes precise spatial-temporal regulation of cell specification, proliferation, and migration. The formation of the ventricular septum during mid-gestation ensures the unidirectional flow of blood, and is necessary for postnatal viability. Notably, a majority of all congenital malformations of the cardiovascular system in humans involve septal abnormalities which afflict 1 out of 100 newborn children in the United States. Thus, a clear understanding of the precise mechanisms involved in this morphogenetic event will undoubtedly reveal important therapeutic targets. The final step in valvuloseptal morphogenesis occurs, in part, by directed movement of flanking myocytes into the cushion mesenchyme. In order to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate this critical myocyte function, we have developed two in vitro methodologies; a transwell assay to assess population changes in motility and a single-cell tracking assay to identify signals that drive the coordinated movement of these cells. These methods have proven effective to identify focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as an intracellular component that is critical for myocyte chemotaxis.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","22222526",2012,"United States"
"Pathophysiology of the cardiac late Na current and its potential as a drug target.","A pathological increase in the late component of the cardiac Na(+) current, I(NaL), has been linked to disease manifestation in inherited and acquired cardiac diseases including the long QT variant 3 (LQT3) syndrome and heart failure. Disruption in I(NaL) leads to action potential prolongation, disruption of normal cellular repolarization, development of arrhythmia triggers, and propensity to ventricular arrhythmia. Attempts to treat arrhythmogenic sequelae from inherited and acquired syndromes pharmacologically with common Na(+) channel blockers (e.g. flecainide, lidocaine, and amiodarone) have been largely unsuccessful. This is due to drug toxicity and the failure of most current drugs to discriminate between the peak current component, chiefly responsible for single cell excitability and propagation in coupled tissue, and the late component (I(NaL)) of the Na(+) current. Although small in magnitude as compared to the peak Na(+) current (~1-3%), I(NaL) alters action potential properties and increases Na(+) loading in cardiac cells. With the increasing recognition that multiple cardiac pathological conditions share phenotypic manifestations of I(NaL) upregulation, there has been renewed interest in specific pharmacological inhibition of I(Na). The novel antianginal agent ranolazine, which shows a marked selectivity for late versus peak Na(+) current, may represent a novel drug archetype for targeted reduction of I(NaL). This article aims to review common pathophysiological mechanisms leading to enhanced I(NaL) in LQT3 and heart failure as prototypical disease conditions. Also reviewed are promising therapeutic strategies tailored to alter the molecular mechanisms underlying I(Na) mediated arrhythmia triggers.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","22198344",2011,"United States"
"The Na+/K+ pump is an important modulator of refractoriness and rotor dynamics in human atrial tissue.","Pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) exhibits limited efficacy. Further developments require a comprehensive characterization of ionic modulators of electrophysiology in human atria. Our aim is to systematically investigate the relative importance of ionic properties in modulating excitability, refractoriness, and rotor dynamics in human atria before and after AF-related electrical remodeling (AFER). Computer simulations of single cell and tissue atrial electrophysiology were conducted using two human atrial action potential (AP) models. Changes in AP, refractory period (RP), conduction velocity (CV), and rotor dynamics caused by alterations in key properties of all atrial ionic currents were characterized before and after AFER. Results show that the investigated human atrial electrophysiological properties are primarily modulated by maximal value of Na(+)/K(+) pump current (G(NaK)) as well as conductances of inward rectifier potassium current (G(K1)) and fast inward sodium current (G(Na)). G(NaK) plays a fundamental role through both electrogenic and homeostatic modulation of AP duration (APD), APD restitution, RP, and reentrant dominant frequency (DF). G(K1) controls DF through modulation of AP, APD restitution, RP, and CV. G(Na) is key in determining DF through alteration of CV and RP, particularly in AFER. Changes in ionic currents have qualitatively similar effects in control and AFER, but effects are smaller in AFER. The systematic analysis conducted in this study unravels the important role of the Na(+)/K(+) pump current in determining human atrial electrophysiology.","American journal of physiology.

"Single cell analysis facilitates staging of Blimp1-dependent primordial germ cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells.","The cell intrinsic programming that regulates mammalian primordial germ cell (PGC) development in the pre-gonadal stage is challenging to investigate. To overcome this we created a transgene-free method for generating PGCs in vitro (iPGCs) from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using labeling for SSEA1 and cKit, two cell surface molecules used previously to isolate presumptive iPGCs, we show that not all SSEA1+/cKit+ double positive cells exhibit a PGC identity. Instead, we determined that selecting for cKit(bright) cells within the SSEA1+ fraction significantly enriches for the putative iPGC population. Single cell analysis comparing SSEA1+/cKit(bright) iPGCs to ESCs and embryonic PGCs demonstrates that 97% of single iPGCs co-express PGC signature genes Blimp1, Stella, Dnd1, Prdm14 and Dazl at similar levels to e9.5-10.5 PGCs, whereas 90% of single mouse ESC do not co-express PGC signature genes. For the 10% of ESCs that co-express PGC signature genes, the levels are significantly lower than iPGCs. Microarray analysis shows that iPGCs are transcriptionally distinct from ESCs and repress gene ontology groups associated with mesoderm and heart development. At the level of chromatin, iPGCs contain 5-methyl cytosine bases in their DNA at imprinted and non-imprinted loci, and are enriched in histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, yet do not have detectable levels of Mvh protein, consistent with a Blimp1-positive pre-gonadal PGC identity. In order to determine whether iPGC formation is dependent upon Blimp1, we generated Blimp1 null ESCs and found that loss of Blimp1 significantly depletes SSEA1/cKit(bright) iPGCs. Taken together, the generation of Blimp1-positive iPGCs from ESCs constitutes a robust model for examining cell-intrinsic regulation of PGCs during the Blimp1-positive stage of development.","PloS one","22194959",2011,"United States"
"Increased vulnerability of human ventricle to re-entrant excitation in hERG-linked variant 1 short QT syndrome.","The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr))-linked SQT1 variant of the SQTS. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (¦ÄV) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD(90) and of the effective refractory period (ERP): effects that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of I(Kr) density in the intact tissue model based on the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov ventricular model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but ¦ÄV was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.","PLoS computational biology","22194679",2011,"United Kingdom"
"Structure of cell networks critically determines oscillation regularity.","Biological rhythms are generated by pacemaker organs, such as the heart pacemaker organ (the sinoatrial node) and the master clock of the circadian rhythms (the suprachiasmatic nucleus), which are composed of a network of autonomously oscillatory cells. Such biological rhythms have notable periodicity despite the internal and external noise present in each cell. Previous experimental studies indicate that the regularity of oscillatory dynamics is enhanced when noisy oscillators interact and become synchronized. This effect, called the collective enhancement of temporal precision, has been studied theoretically using particular assumptions. In this study, we propose a general theoretical framework that enables us to understand the dependence of temporal precision on network parameters including size, connectivity, and coupling intensity; this effect has been poorly understood to date. Our framework is based on a phase oscillator model that is applicable to general oscillator networks with any coupling mechanism if coupling and noise are sufficiently weak. In particular, we can manage general directed and weighted networks. We quantify the precision of the activity of a single cell and the mean activity of an arbitrary subset of cells. We find that, in general undirected networks, the standard deviation of cycle-to-cycle periods scales with the system size N as 1/N, but only up to a certain system size N(<U+204E>) that depends on network parameters. Enhancement of temporal precision is ineffective when N&gt;N(<U+204E>). We provide an example in which temporal precision considerably improves with increasing N while the level of synchrony remains almost constant; temporal precision and synchrony are independent dynamical properties. We also reveal the advantage of long-range interactions among cells to temporal precision.","Journal of theoretical biology","22185977",2011,"England"
"Differential conditions for early after-depolarizations and triggered activity in cardiomyocytes derived from transgenic LQT1 and LQT2 rabbits.","Early after-depolarization (EAD), or abnormal depolarization during the plateau phase of action potentials, is a hallmark of long-QT syndrome (LQTS). More than 13 genes have been identified as responsible for LQTS, and elevated risks for EADs may depend on genotypes, such as exercise in LQT1 vs. sudden arousal in LQT2 patients. We investigated mechanisms underlying different high-risk conditions that trigger EADs using transgenic rabbit models of LQT1 and LQT2, which lack I(Ks) and I(Kr) (slow and fast components of delayed rectifying K(+) current), respectively. Single-cell patch-clamp studies show that prolongation of action potential duration (APD) can be further enhanced by lowering extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)) from 5.4 to 3.6 mm. However, only LQT2 myocytes developed spontaneous EADs following perfusion with lower [K(+)](o), while there was no EAD formation in littermate control (LMC) or LQT1 myocytes, although APDs were also prolonged in LMC myocytes and LQT1 myocytes. Isoprenaline (ISO) prolonged APDs and triggered EADs in LQT1 myocytes in the presence of lower [K(+)](o). In contrast, continuous ISO perfusion diminished APD prolongation and reduced the incidence of EADs in LQT2 myocytes. These different effects of ISO on LQT1 and LQT2 were verified by optical mapping of the whole heart, suggesting that ISO-induced EADs are genotype specific. Further voltage-clamp studies revealed that ISO increases L-type calcium current (I(Ca)) faster than I(Ks) (time constant 9.2 s for I(Ca) and 43.6 s for I(Ks)), and computer simulation demonstrated a high-risk window of EADs in LQT2 during ISO perfusion owing to mismatch in the time courses of I(Ca) and I(Ks), which may explain why a sympathetic surge rather than high sympathetic tone can be an effective trigger of EADs in LQT2 perfused hearts. In summary, EAD formation is genotype specific, such that EADs can be elicited in LQT2 myocytes simply by lowering [K(+)](o), while LQT1 myocytes require sympathetic stimulation. Slower activation of I(Ks) than of I(Ca) by ISO may explain why different sympathetic modes, i.e. sympathetic surge vs. high sympathetic tone, are associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in LQTS patients.","The Journal of physiology","22183728",2011,"United States"
"Intracellular recordings of action potentials by an extracellular nanoscale field-effect transistor.","The ability to make electrical measurements inside cells has led to many important advances in electrophysiology. The patch clamp technique, in which a glass micropipette filled with electrolyte is inserted into a cell, offers both high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution. Ideally, the micropipette should be as small as possible to increase the spatial resolution and reduce the invasiveness of the measurement, but the overall performance of the technique depends on the impedance of the interface between the micropipette and the cell interior, which limits how small the micropipette can be. Techniques that involve inserting metal or carbon microelectrodes into cells are subject to similar constraints. Field-effect transistors (FETs) can also record electric potentials inside cells, and because their performance does not depend on impedance, they can be made much smaller than micropipettes and microelectrodes. Moreover, FET arrays are better suited for multiplexed measurements. Previously, we have demonstrated FET-based intracellular recording with kinked nanowire structures, but the kink configuration and device design places limits on the probe size and the potential for multiplexing. Here, we report a new approach in which a SiO2 nanotube is synthetically integrated on top of a nanoscale FET. This nanotube penetrates the cell membrane, bringing the cell cytosol into contact with the FET, which is then able to record the intracellular transmembrane potential. Simulations show that the bandwidth of this branched intracellular nanotube FET (BIT-FET) is high enough for it to record fast action potentials even when the nanotube diameter is decreased to 3 nm, a length scale well below that accessible with other methods. Studies of cardiomyocyte cells demonstrate that when phospholipid-modified BIT-FETs are brought close to cells, the nanotubes can spontaneously penetrate the cell membrane to allow the full-amplitude intracellular action potential to be recorded, thus showing that a stable and tight seal forms between the nanotube and cell membrane. We also show that multiple BIT-FETs can record multiplexed intracellular signals from both single cells and networks of cells.","Nature nanotechnology","22179566",2011,"United States"
"Automated image analysis identifies signaling pathways regulating distinct signatures of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.","Cardiac hypertrophy is controlled by a complex signal transduction and gene regulatory network, containing multiple layers of crosstalk and feedback. While numerous individual components of this network have been identified, understanding how these elements are coordinated to regulate heart growth remains a challenge. Past approaches to measure cardiac myocyte hypertrophy have been manual and often qualitative, hindering the ability to systematically characterize the network's higher-order control structure and identify therapeutic targets. Here, we develop and validate an automated image analysis approach for objectively quantifying multiple hypertrophic phenotypes from immunofluorescence images. This approach incorporates cardiac myocyte-specific optimizations and provides quantitative measures of myocyte size, elongation, circularity, sarcomeric organization, and cell-cell contact. As a proof-of-concept, we examined the hypertrophic response to ¦Á-adrenergic, ¦Â-adrenergic, tumor necrosis factor (TNF¦Á), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and fetal bovine serum pathways. While all five hypertrophic pathways increased myocyte size, other hypertrophic metrics were differentially regulated, forming a distinct phenotype signature for each pathway. Sarcomeric organization was uniquely enhanced by ¦Á-adrenergic signaling. TNF¦Á and ¦Á-adrenergic pathways markedly decreased cell circularity due to increased myocyte protrusion. Surprisingly, adrenergic and IGF-1 pathways differentially regulated myocyte-myocyte contact, potentially forming a feed-forward loop that regulates hypertrophy. Automated image analysis unlocks a range of new quantitative phenotypic data, aiding dissection of the complex hypertrophic signaling network and enabling myocyte-based high-content drug screening.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","22142594",2011,"United States"
"Probing the mechanobiological properties of human embryonic stem cells in cardiac differentiation by optical tweezers.","Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) hold great promise for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However the mechanobiological properties of hESC and hESC-CM remains elusive. In this paper, we examined the dynamic and static micromechanical properties of hESC and hESC-CM, by manipulating via optical tweezers at the single-cell level. Theoretical approaches were developed to model the dynamic and static mechanical responses of cells during optical stretching. Our experiments showed that the mechanical stiffness of differentiated hESC-CM increased after cardiac differentiation. Such stiffening could associate with increasingly organized myofibrillar assembly that underlines the functional characteristics of hESC-CM. In summary, our findings lay the ground work for using hESC-CMs as models to study mechanical and contractile defects in heart diseases.","Journal of biomechanics","22104169",2011,"United States"
"MicroRNA profiling predicts a variance in the proliferative potential of cardiac progenitor cells derived from neonatal and adult murine hearts.","Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are multipotent cells that may offer tremendous potentials for the regeneration of injured myocardium. To expand the limited number of CPCs for effective clinical regeneration of myocardium, it is important to understand their proliferative potentials. Single-cell based assays were utilized to purify c-kit(pos) CPCs from human and mouse hearts. MicroRNA profiling identified eight differentially expressed microRNAs in CPCs from neonatal and adult hearts. Notably, the predicted protein targets were predominantly involved in cellular proliferation-related pathways. To directly test this phenotypic prediction, the developmental variance in the proliferation of CPCs was tested. Ki67 protein expression and DNA kinetics were tested in human and mouse in vivo CPCs, and doubling times were tested in primary culture of mouse CPCs. The human embryonic and mouse neonatal CPCs showed a six-fold increase in Ki67 expressing cells, a two-fold increase in the number of cells in S/G2-M phases of cell cycle, and a seven-fold increase in the doubling time in culture when compared to the corresponding adult CPCs. The over-expression of miR-17-92 increased the proliferation in adult CPCs in vivo by two-fold. In addition, the level of retinoblastoma-like 2 (Rbl2/p130) protein was two-fold higher in adult compared to neonatal-mouse CPCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate a differentially regulated cohort of microRNAs that predicts differences in cellular proliferation in CPCs during postnatal development and target microRNAs that are involved in this transition. Our study provides new insights that may enhance the utilization of adult CPCs for regenerative therapy of the injured myocardium.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","22062954",2011,"United States"
"Human cardiac progenitor cell grafts as unrestricted source of supernumerary cardiac cells in healthy murine hearts.","Human heart harbors a population of resident progenitor cells that can be isolated by stem cell antigen-1 antibody and expanded in culture. These cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro and contribute to cardiac regeneration in vivo. However, when directly injected as single cell suspension, less than 1%-5% survive and differentiate. Among the major causes of this failure are the distressing protocols used to culture in vitro and implant progenitor cells into damaged hearts. Human cardiac progenitors obtained from the auricles of patients were cultured as scaffoldless engineered tissues fabricated using temperature-responsive surfaces. In the engineered tissue, progenitor cells established proper three-dimensional intercellular relationships and were embedded in self-produced extracellular matrix preserving their phenotype and multipotency in the absence of significant apoptosis. After engineered tissues were leant on visceral pericardium, a number of cells migrated into the murine myocardium and in the vascular walls, where they integrated in the respective textures. The study demonstrates the suitability of such an approach to deliver stem cells to the myocardium. Interestingly, the successful delivery of cells in murine healthy hearts suggests that myocardium displays a continued cell cupidity that is strictly regulated by the limited release of progenitor cells by the adopted source. When an unregulated cell source is added to the system, cells are delivered to the myocardium. The exploitation of this novel concept may pave the way to the setup of new protocols in cardiac cell therapy.","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","22009661",2011,"United States"
"Adaptive transcriptional dynamics of A2 neurons and central cardiovascular control pathways.","In order to provide an example of useful interaction between systems biology and computational neuroscience traditions, here we aim to identify the molecular response process through which elevated blood pressure induces a temporal sequence of gene expression changes. This initial response may then continually evolve as an adaptive response, altering central blood pressure set-point control. Our approach involves using a set of 96 quantitative PCR gene assays, which represent the molecular process associated with neuronal responses to angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) activation. We use this set as a probe to search for the AT1R signalling-triggered expression programme in individual neurons and groups of neurons involved in homeostatic regulation of cardiorespiratory function. Specifically, we focus on tissue samples from the nucleus tractus solitarii, as well as groups of A2 neurons and individual A2 cells within the nucleus tractus solitarii, and in the ventrolateral medulla and central amygdala. We assay these neural samples at rest and in response to elevated blood pressure. Analysis of the resulting high-dimensional data set reveals a remarkable complexity and heterogeneity of the samples and of their response to changes in blood pressure. These results demonstrate differential expression programmes for each anatomically distinct neuronal group and neuronal type. Single-cell expression analysis shows that A2 cells also are variable, and that the subset that responds to blood pressure with elevated Fos expression differs from other A2 cells. We present models of gene regulatory networks and of signalling cascades related to AT1R and broadly discuss the opportunities for valuable interactions between systems biology and computational neuroscience.","Experimental physiology","22002872",2011,"United States"
"A human ventricular cell model for investigation of cardiac arrhythmias under hyperkalaemic conditions.","In this study, several modifications were introduced to a recently proposed human ventricular action potential (AP) model so as to render it suitable for the study of ventricular arrhythmias. These modifications were driven by new sets of experimental data available from the literature and the analysis of several well-established cellular arrhythmic risk biomarkers, namely AP duration at 90 per cent repolarization (APD(90)), AP triangulation, calcium dynamics, restitution properties, APD(90) adaptation to abrupt heart rate changes, and rate dependence of intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. The proposed methodology represents a novel framework for the development of cardiac cell models. Five stimulation protocols were applied to the original model and the ventricular AP model developed here to compute the described arrhythmic risk biomarkers. In addition, those models were tested in a one-dimensional fibre in which hyperkalaemia was simulated by increasing the extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o). The effective refractory period (ERP), conduction velocity (CV) and the occurrence of APD alternans were investigated. Results show that modifications improved model behaviour as verified by: (i) AP triangulation well within experimental limits (the difference between APD at 50 and 90 per cent repolarization being 78.1 ms); (ii) APD(90) rate adaptation dynamics characterized by fast and slow time constants within physiological ranges (10.1 and 105.9 s); and (iii) maximum S1S2 restitution slope in accordance with experimental data (S(S1S2)=1.0). In simulated tissues under hyperkalaemic conditions, APD(90) progressively shortened with the degree of hyperkalaemia, whereas ERP increased once a threshold in [K(+)](o) was reached ([K(+)](o)¡Ö6 mM). CV decreased with [K(+)](o), and conduction was blocked for [K(+)](o)&gt;10.4 mM. APD(90) alternans were observed for [K(+)](o)&gt;9.8 mM. Those results adequately reproduce experimental observations. This study demonstrated the value of basing the development of AP models on the computation of arrhythmic risk biomarkers, as opposed to joining together independently derived ion channel descriptions to produce a whole-cell AP model, with the new framework providing a better picture of the model performance under a variety of stimulation conditions. On top of replicating experimental data at single-cell level, the model developed here was able to predict the occurrence of APD(90) alternans and areas of conduction block associated with high [K(+)](o) in tissue, which is of relevance for the investigation of the arrhythmogenic substrate in ischaemic hearts.","Philosophical transactions.

"Primitive cardiac cells from human embryonic stem cells.","Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are currently being investigated for in vitro human heart models and as potential therapeutics for heart failure. In this study, we have developed a differentiation protocol that minimizes the need for specific human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line optimization. We first reduced the heterogeneity that exists within the starting population of bulk cultured hESCs by using cells adapted to single-cell passaging in a 2-dimensional (2D) culture format. Compared with bulk cultures, single-cell cultures comprised larger fractions of TG30(hi)/OCT4(hi) cells, corresponding to an increased expression of pluripotency markers OCT4 and NANOG, and reduced expression of early lineage-specific markers. A 2D temporal differentiation protocol was then developed, aimed at reducing the inherent heterogeneity and variability of embryoid body-based protocols, with induction of primitive streak cells using bone morphogenetic protein 4 and activin A, followed by cardiogenesis via inhibition of Wnt signaling using the small molecules IWP-4 or IWR-1. IWP-4 treatment resulted in a large percentage of cells expressing low amounts of cardiac myosin heavy chain and expression of early cardiac progenitor markers ISL1 and NKX2-5, thus indicating the production of large numbers of immature cardiomyocytes (~65,000/cm(2) or ~1.5 per input hESC). This protocol was shown to be effective in HES3, H9, and, to a lesser, extent, MEL1 hESC lines. In addition, we observed that IWR-1 induced predominantly atrial myosin light chain (MLC2a) expression, whereas IWP-4 induced expression of both atrial (MLC2a) and ventricular (MLC2v) forms. The intrinsic flexibility and scalability of this 2D protocol mean that the output population of primitive cardiomyocytes will be particularly accessible and useful for the investigation of molecular mechanisms driving terminal cardiomyocyte differentiation, and potentially for the future treatment of heart failure.","Stem cells and development","21933026",2011,"United States"
"Functional and morphological preservation of adult ventricular myocytes in culture by sub-micromolar cytochalasin D supplement.","In cardiac myocytes, cytochalasin D (CytoD) was reported to act as an actin disruptor and mechanical uncoupler. Using confocal and super-resolution STED microscopy, we show that CytoD preserves the actin filament architecture of adult rat ventricular myocytes in culture. Five hundred nanomolar CytoD was the optimal concentration to achieve both preservation of the T-tubular structure during culture periods of 3 days and conservation of major functional characteristics such as action potentials, calcium transients and, importantly, the contractile properties of single myocytes. Therefore, we conclude that the addition of CytoD to the culture of adult cardiac myocytes can indeed be used to generate a solid single-cell model that preserves both morphology and function of freshly isolated cells. Moreover, we reveal a putative link between cytoskeletal and T-tubular remodeling. In the absence of CytoD, we observed a loss of T-tubules that led to significant dyssynchronous Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR), while in the presence of 0.5 ¦ÌM CytoD, T-tubules and homogeneous CICR were majorly preserved. Such data suggested a possible link between the actin cytoskeleton, T-tubules and synchronous, reliable excitation-contraction-coupling. Thus, T-tubular re-organization in cell culture sheds some additional light onto similar processes found during many cardiac diseases and might link cytoskeletal alterations to changes in subcellular Ca(2+) signaling revealed under such pathophysiological conditions.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","21930133",2011,"England"
"Quantitative in situ analysis of FoxP3+ T regulatory cells on transplant tissue using laser scanning cytometry.","There is abundant evidence that immune cells infiltrating into a transplanted organ play a critical role for destructive inflammatory or regulatory immune reactions. Quantitative in situ analysis (i.e., in tissue sections) of immune cells remains challenging due to a lack of objective  methodology. Laser scanning cytometry (LSC) is an imaging-based methodology that performs quantitative measurements on fluorescently and/ or chromatically stained tissue or cellular specimens at a single-cell level. In this study, we have developed a novel objective method for analysis of  immune cells, including Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs), on formalin-fixed /paraffin-embedded (FFPE) transplant biopsy sections using iCys<U+00AE> Research Imaging Cytometer. The development of multiple immunofluorescent staining was established using FFPE human tonsil sample. The  CD4/CD8 ratio and the population of Tregs among CD4(+) cells were analyzed using iCys and compared with the results from conventional flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Our multiple immunofluorescent staining techniques allow obtaining clear staining on FFPE sections. The CD4/CD8 ratio  analyzed by iCys was concordant with those obtained by FCM. This method was also applicable for liver, small intestine, kidney, pancreas, and heart transplant biopsy sections and provide an objective quantification of Tregs within the grafts.","Cell transplantation","21929847",2011,"United States"
"Heterogeneity in SDF-1 expression defines the vasculogenic potential of adult cardiac progenitor cells.","RATIONALE: The adult myocardium has been reported to harbor several classes of multipotent progenitor cells (CPCs) with tri-lineage differentiation potential. It is not clear whether c-kit+CPCs represent a uniform precursor population or a more complex mixture of cell types.OBJECTIVE: To characterize and understand vasculogenic heterogeneity within c-kit+presumptive cardiac progenitor cell populations.METHODS AND RESULTS: c-kit+, sca-1+ CPCs obtained from adult mouse left ventricle expressed stem cell-associated genes, including Oct-4 and Myc, and were self-renewing, pluripotent and clonogenic. Detailed single cell clonal analysis of 17 clones revealed that most (14/17) exhibited trilineage differentiation potential. However, striking morphological differences were observed among clones that were heritable and stable in long-term culture. 3 major groups were identified: round (7/17), flat or spindle-shaped (5/17) and stellate (5/17). Stellate morphology was predictive of vasculogenic differentiation in Matrigel. Genome-wide expression studies and bioinformatic analysis revealed clonally stable, heritable differences in stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) expression that correlated strongly with stellate morphology and vasculogenic capacity. Endogenous SDF-1 production contributed directly to vasculogenic differentiation: both shRNA-mediated knockdown of SDF-1 and AMD3100, an antagonist of the SDF-1 receptor CXC chemokine Receptor-4 (CXCR4), reduced tube-forming capacity, while exogenous SDF-1 induced tube formation by 2 non-vasculogenic clones. CPCs producing SDF-1 were able to vascularize Matrigel dermal implants in vivo, while CPCs with low SDF-1 production were not.CONCLUSIONS: Clonogenic c-kit+, sca-1+ CPCs are heterogeneous in morphology, gene expression patterns and differentiation potential. Clone-specific levels of SDF-1 expression both predict and promote development of a vasculogenic phenotype via a previously unreported autocrine mechanism.","PloS one","21887363",2011,"United States"
"Cardiac electromechanical models: from cell to organ.","The heart is a multiphysics and multiscale system that has driven the development of the most sophisticated mathematical models at the frontiers of computational physiology and medicine. This review focuses on electromechanical (EM) models of the heart from the molecular level of myofilaments to anatomical models of the organ. Because of the coupling in terms of function and emergent behaviors at each level of biological hierarchy, separation of behaviors at a given scale is difficult. Here, a separation is drawn at the cell level so that the first half addresses subcellular/single-cell models and the second half addresses organ models. At the subcellular level, myofilament models represent actin-myosin interaction and Ca-based activation. The discussion of specific models emphasizes the roles of cooperative mechanisms and sarcomere length dependence of contraction force, considered to be the cellular basis of the Frank-Starling law. A model of electrophysiology and Ca handling can be coupled to a myofilament model to produce an EM cell model, and representative examples are summarized to provide an overview of the progression of the field. The second half of the review covers organ-level models that require solution of the electrical component as a reaction-diffusion system and the mechanical component, in which active tension generated by the myocytes produces deformation of the organ as described by the equations of continuum mechanics. As outlined in the review, different organ-level models have chosen to use different ionic and myofilament models depending on the specific application; this choice has been largely dictated by compromises between model complexity and computational tractability. The review also addresses application areas of EM models such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and the role of mechano-electric coupling in arrhythmias and defibrillation.","Frontiers in physiology","21886622",2011,"United States"
"The subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells that differentiate toward cardiomyocytes is cardiac progenitor cells.","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are regarded as a promising source of cell-based therapy for heart injury. In fact, less than 30% of MSCs contribute to cardiomyocytes differentiation, and the isolation procedure and biological characteristics of this population of cells remain unknown. Here we isolate and investigate the biological characteristics of this subpopulation of MSCs. Twenty four MSC clones were randomly selected using single-cell monoclonal technology. After induced with 5-azacytidine, eight clones displayed cardiomyocyte-like morphologies, and highly (over 90%) expressed cardiac-specific markers cTnT and ¦Á-actin, and displayed transient outward K(+) current (I(to)), inwardly rectifying K(+) current (I(K1)) and delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(KDR)), which were typical of cardiomocytes. Other clones merely showed I(to) current, and the current densities were different from those of cardiomyocytes. In contrast to the other clones, before induced with 5-azacytidine, the eight clones expressed early cardiac markers GATA4 and NKX2.5, but not cTnT, ¦Á-actin, CD44 and CD90, and had no potentials for adiopogenesis, osteogenesis or chondrogenesis after induction. Our data suggest that the subgroup of MSCs that contributes to cardiomyocytes differentiation is cardiac progenitor cells. Moreover, we show the preliminary purification of this population of cells with a high potential for cardiomyocytes differentiation using single-cell monoclonal technology.","Experimental cell research","21878326",2011,"United States"
"Detection of cardiac myosin heavy chain-¦Á-specific CD4 cells by using MHC class II/IA(k) tetramers in A/J mice.","A/J mice bearing the H-2 allele IA(k) are highly susceptible to autoimmune myocarditis induced with cardiac myosin heavy chain (Myhc)-¦Á 334-352, whereas B10.A mice carrying a similar allele IA(k) are relatively resistant, suggesting that the generation of Myhc-¦Á-reactive T cell repertoires is influenced by genetic background. To enumerate the precursor frequencies of Myhc-¦Á-specific CD4 T cells, we sought to create IA(k) tetramers for Myhc-¦Á 334-352. Tetramers were created using approaches that involve covalent tethering of individual peptide sequences or exogenous loading of peptides into empty IA(k) molecules by peptide-exchange reaction. Using ribonuclease 43-56 tetramers as controls, we demonstrated that by flow cytometry (FC), Myhc-¦Á 334-352 tetramers specifically bind myosin-reactive T cells. CD4 cells isolated from A/J mice immunized with Myhc-¦Á 334-352 were used to optimize conditions for tetramer staining, and neuraminidase treatment prior to tetramer staining permitted the detection of Myhc-¦Á-specific cells ex vivo. The reagents are useful tools for monitoring the frequency of Myhc-¦Á-reactive CD4 cells and to determine their pathogenic potential at a single cell level by FC.","Journal of immunological methods","21782819",2011,"Netherlands"
"Bioengineering human microvascular networks in immunodeficient mice.","The future of tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for tissue regeneration will likely rely on our ability to generate functional vascular networks in vivo. In this regard, the search for experimental models to build blood vessel networks in vivo is of utmost importance. The feasibility of bioengineering microvascular networks in vivo was first shown using human tissue-derived mature endothelial cells (ECs); however, such autologous endothelial cells present problems for wide clinical use, because they are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities and require harvesting from existing vasculature. These limitations have instigated the search for other sources of ECs. The identification of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) in blood presented an opportunity to non-invasively obtain ECs (5-7). We and other authors have shown that adult and cord blood-derived ECFCs have the capacity to form functional vascular networks in vivo. Importantly, these studies have also shown that to obtain stable and durable vascular networks, ECFCs require co-implantation with perivascular cells. The assay we describe here illustrates this concept: we show how human cord blood-derived ECFCs can be combined with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a single cell suspension in a collagen/fibronectin/fibrinogen gel to form a functional human vascular network within 7 days after implantation into an immunodeficient mouse. The presence of human ECFC-lined lumens containing host erythrocytes can be seen throughout the implants indicating not only the formation (de novo) of a vascular network, but also the development of functional anastomoses with the host circulatory system. This murine model of bioengineered human vascular network is ideally suited for studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human vascular network formation and for the development of strategies to vascularize engineered tissues.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","21775960",2011,"United States"
"Targeting intracellular calcium cycling in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: a theoretical investigation.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a malignant arrhythmogenic disorder linked to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and calsequestrin, predisposing the young to syncope and cardiac arrest. To define the role of ¦Â-adrenergic stimulation (BAS) and to identify potential therapeutic targeted sites relating to intracellular calcium cycling, we used a Luo-Rudy dynamic ventricular myocyte model incorporated with interacting Markov models of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (I(Ca,L)) and RyR2 to simulate the heterozygous state of mouse RyR2 R4496C mutation (RyR2(R4496C+/-)) comparable with CPVT patients with RyR2 R4497C mutation. Characteristically, in simulated cells, pacing at 4 Hz or faster or pacing at 2 Hz under BAS with effects equivalent to those of isoproterenol at ¡Ý 0.1 ¦ÌM could readily induce delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and DAD-mediated triggered activity (TA) in RyR2(R4496C+/-) but not in the wild-type via enhancing both I(Ca,L) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (I(UP)). Moreover, with the use of steady state values of isolated endocardial (Endo), mid-myocardial (M), and epicardial (Epi) cells as initial data for conducting single cell and one-dimensional strand studies, the M cell was more vulnerable for developing DADs and DAD-mediated TA than Endo and Epi cells, and the gap junction coupling represented by diffusion coefficient (D) of ¡Ü 0.000766*98 cm(2)/ms was required for generating DAD-mediated TA in RyR2(R4496C+/-). Whereas individual reduction of Ca(2+) release channel of SR and Na-Ca exchanger up to 50% was ineffective, 30% or more reduction of either I(Ca,L) or I(UP) could totally suppress the inducibility of arrhythmia under BAS. Of note, 15% reduction of both I(Ca,L) and I(UP) exerted a synergistic antiarrhythmic efficacy. Findings of this model study confirm that BAS facilitates induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias via its action on intracellular Ca(2+) cycling and a pharmacological regimen capable of reducing I(Ca,L) could be an effective adjunctive to ¦Â-adrenergic blockers for suppressing ventricular tachyarrhythmias during CPVT.","American journal of physiology.

"Chronic ¦Â-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment controls cardiovascular remodeling in heart failure in the aging spontaneously hypertensive rat.","Selective ¦Â1-adrenoceptor antagonists are part of standard therapy to prolong survival in human heart failure. This study has measured structural, functional, and electrical changes in the cardiovascular system of aging male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to determine whether ¦Â1-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment can prevent or reverse the development of cardiovascular remodeling and heart failure in these rats. Fifteen-month-old male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats or SHRs were treated with increasing metoprolol doses (30 mg¡¤kg¡¤d for 4 weeks, then 50 mg¡¤kg¡¤d for 4 weeks, then 80 mg¡¤kg¡¤d for 16 weeks po). Cardiovascular structure and function were determined using organ wet weight, in vivo echocardiography, histological analysis of inflammation and collagen, isolated heart and thoracic aortic ring preparations, and single cell microelectrode measurements. From 15 months, untreated SHRs developed left ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis, and action potential prolongation together with progressive systolic, diastolic, and endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiac stiffness. Treatment with metoprolol decreased systolic blood pressure at 21 months only but improved survival, decreased ventricular weight, prevented chamber dilation, reduced inflammation, decreased fibrosis, attenuated action potential prolongation, improved systolic and diastolic function, decreased stiffness and improved endothelium-independent vascular responses. Chronic metoprolol treatment markedly attenuated both cardiac and vascular remodeling in the aging SHRs, thus attenuating the onset of heart failure and improving survival, independent of blood pressure reduction.","Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology","21709583",2011,"United States"
"Confinement of ¦Â(1)- and ¦Â(2)-adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocyte-like H9c2 cells is mediated by selective interactions with PDZ domain and A-kinase anchoring proteins but not caveolae.","The sympathetic nervous system regulates cardiac output by activating adrenergic receptors (ARs) in cardiac myocytes. The predominant cardiac ARs, ¦Â(1)- and ¦Â(2)AR, are structurally similar but mediate distinct signaling responses. Scaffold protein-mediated compartmentalization of ARs into discrete, multiprotein complexes has been proposed to dictate differential signaling responses. To test the hypothesis that ¦ÂARs integrate into complexes in live cells, we measured receptor diffusion and interactions by single-particle tracking. Unstimulated ¦Â(1)- and ¦Â(2)AR were highly confined in the membrane of H9c2 cardiomyocyte-like cells, indicating that receptors are tethered and presumably integrated into protein complexes. Selective disruption of interactions with postsynaptic density protein 95/disks large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)-domain proteins and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) increased receptor diffusion, indicating that these scaffold proteins participate in receptor confinement. In contrast, modulation of interactions between the putative scaffold caveolae and ¦Â(2)AR did not alter receptor dynamics, suggesting that these membrane domains are not involved in ¦Â(2)AR confinement. For both ¦Â(1)- and ¦Â(2)AR, the receptor carboxy-terminus was uniquely responsible for scaffold interactions. Our data formally demonstrate that distinct and stable protein complexes containing ¦Â(1)- or ¦Â(2)AR are formed in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocyte-like cells and that selective PDZ and AKAP interactions are responsible for the integration of receptors into complexes.","Molecular biology of the cell","21680711",2011,"United States"
"Trisomy 18: experience of a reference hospital from the south of Brazil.","Trisomy 18 is a chromosomal syndrome characterized by a broad clinical picture, as well as a very reserved prognosis. The aim of our study was to verify the clinical characteristics and survival of patients diagnosed in a referral hospital in southern Brazil. Our sample consisted of 31 patients, 22 were female (71%), ages ranging from 1 to 1,395 days (median 14 days). The majority had a single cell lineage with full trisomy of chromosome 18 (94%). Concerning pregnancy complications, pre-eclampsia was the main abnormality described (17%). Fetal ultrasound was performed in 23 cases, and the most frequent abnormalities were polyhydramnios (41%) and intrauterine growth retardation (27%). There were no reports of prenatal identification of the syndrome. Most patients were born by cesarean due to pregnancy and fetal complications and about half of the cases were premature. Congenital heart defects represented the main major malformation observed (94%). Thirty patients (97%) progressed to death (survival ranged from 2 to 780 days, and 87% died within the first 6 months of life). Trisomy 18 is a serious chromosomal disorder with limited survival. Abnormalities of pregnancy appear to be frequent, which can lead to complications for both fetus and mother. The prenatal identification of these patients in our country is still inadequate, resulting in important implications for genetic counseling and management of these patients and their families.

"Genotoxicity of endosseous implants using two cellular lineages in vitro.","The genotoxic potential of corrosion eluates obtained from a single dental implant using murine fibroblasts or osteoblasts cells in vitro by the single-cell gel (comet) assay was examined. A single commercially available dental implant (Biotechnology) was eluted in a solution consisting of equal amounts of acetic acid and sodium chloride (0.1 M) for 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. Murine fibroblast or osteoblast cultures were then exposed to all corrosion eluates obtained from endosseous dental implants for 30 minutes at 37¡ãC. The results suggest that none of the eluates produced genotoxic changes in murine fibroblasts regardless of the length of exposure to the eluate. Similarly, no genotoxicity was found in osteoblasts. The results suggest that the dental implant eluates tested in this study did not induce genetic damage as depicted by the single-cell gel (comet) assay. Because DNA damage is an important event during oncogenesis, this study represents a relevant contribution to estimate the real risks to the cellular system induced by the corrosion products of a dental implant.","The Journal of oral implantology","21651414",2011,"United States"
"The potential role of Th17 in mediating the transition from acute to chronic autoimmune inflammation: rheumatoid arthritis as a model.","T helper 17 cells (Th17) have arisen in the last 15 years as major effector cells in several chronic inflammatory states. In synovitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Th17 emerged as being involved in driving the active acute phases and correlated with local and systemic parameters of inflammation; in particular, TCR¦Æ(dim) Th17 appear to be the greatest producers of IL-17 at the single-cell level. IL-1beta and IL-6, along with IL-23, arose as the major drivers of differentiation and local development of Th17, while IL-15 and cell-cell contact can trigger the local production of IL-17. TNF-alpha inhibition can reversibly block the migration of pathogenic effector memory TCRzeta(dim) T cells and CCR6+ Th17 from peripheral blood to inflamed tissues. IL-17 is a potent chemoattractant for pre-committed CD4+ T cells and neutrophils, and may promote the migration of B cells to lymphoid follicles in the chronic phase of synovial inflammation. Importantly, IL-17 drives osteoclastogenesis and neoangiogenesis in the RA joint. These data strongly suggest that Th17 are key effector cells in driving the transition from the acute to the chronic phase of RA inflammation.","Discovery medicine","21616040",2011,"United States"
"On-chip constructive cell-network study (I): contribution of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte beating synchronization and community effect.","BACKGROUNDS: To clarify the role of cardiac fibroblasts in beating synchronization, we have made simple lined-up cardiomyocyte-fibroblast network model in an on-chip single-cell-based cultivation system.RESULTS: The synchronization phenomenon of two cardiomyocyte networks connected by fibroblasts showed (1) propagation velocity of electrophysiological signals decreased a magnitude depending on the increasing number of fibroblasts, not the lengths of fibroblasts; (2) fluctuation of interbeat intervals of the synchronized two cardiomyocyte network connected by fibroblasts did not always decreased, and was opposite from homogeneous cardiomyocyte networks; and (3) the synchronized cardiomyocytes connected by fibroblasts sometimes loses their synchronized condition and recovered to synchronized condition, in which the length of asynchronized period was shorter less than 30 beats and was independent to their cultivation time, whereas the length of synchronized period increased according to cultivation time.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that fibroblasts can connect cardiomyocytes electrically but do not significantly enhance and contribute to beating interval stability and synchronization. This might also mean that an increase in the number of fibroblasts in heart tissue reduces the cardiomyocyte 'community effect', which enhances synchronization and stability of their beating rhythms.","Journal of nanobiotechnology","21605419",2011,"England"
"Engineering biosynthetic excitable tissues from unexcitable cells for electrophysiological and cell therapy studies.","Patch-clamp recordings in single-cell expression systems have been traditionally used to study the function of ion channels. However, this experimental setting does not enable assessment of tissue-level function such as action potential (AP) conduction. Here we introduce a biosynthetic system that permits studies of both channel activity in single cells and electrical conduction in multicellular networks. We convert unexcitable somatic cells into an autonomous source of electrically excitable and conducting cells by stably expressing only three membrane channels. The specific roles that these expressed channels have on AP shape and conduction are revealed by different pharmacological and pacing protocols. Furthermore, we demonstrate that biosynthetic excitable cells and tissues can repair large conduction defects within primary 2- and 3-dimensional cardiac cell cultures. This approach enables novel studies of ion channel function in a reproducible tissue-level setting and may stimulate the development of new cell-based therapies for excitable tissue repair.","Nature communications","21556054",2011,"United States"

This culture technique was successfully tested on two hiPSC clones, three hESC lines and on a nonhuman primate ESC line. It is based on a defined medium and single-cell inoculation, but it does not require culture preadaptation, use of microcarriers or any other matrices. Over a time course of 4-7 d, hPSCs can be expanded up to sixfold. Preparation of a high-density culture and its subsequent translation to scalable stirred suspension in Erlenmeyer flasks and stirred spinner flasks are also feasible. Importantly, hPSCs maintain pluripotency and karyotype stability for more than ten passages.","Nature protocols","21527925",2011,"England"
"Cellular stoichiometry of the chemotaxis proteins in Bacillus subtilis.","The chemoreceptor-CheA kinase-CheW coupling protein complex, with ancillary associated proteins, is at the heart of chemotactic signal transduction in bacteria. The goal of this work was to determine the cellular stoichiometry of the chemotaxis signaling proteins in Bacillus subtilis. Quantitative immunoblotting was used to determine the total number of chemotaxis proteins in a single cell of B. subtilis. Significantly higher levels of chemoreceptors and much lower levels of CheA kinase were measured in B. subtilis than in Escherichia coli. The resulting cellular ratio of chemoreceptor dimers per CheA dimer in B. subtilis is roughly 23.0 ¡À 4.5 compared to 3.4 ¡À 0.8 receptor dimers per CheA dimer observed in E. coli, but the ratios of the coupling protein CheW to the CheA dimer are nearly identical in the two organisms. The ratios of CheB to CheR in B. subtilis are also very similar, although the overall levels of modification enzymes are higher. When the potential binding partners of CheD are deleted, the levels of CheD drop significantly. This finding suggests that B. subtilis selectively degrades excess chemotaxis proteins to maintain optimum ratios. Finally, the two cytoplasmic receptors were observed to localize among the other receptors at the cell poles and appear to participate in the chemoreceptor complex. These results suggest that there are many novel features of B. subtilis chemotaxis compared with the mechanism in E. coli, but they are built on a common core.","Journal of bacteriology","21515776",2011,"United States"
"Differential response related to genotoxicity in multiple organs of cirrhotic rats.","PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to use the single cell gel (comet) assay to investigate whether blood, liver, heart, kidney, and brain are particularly sensitive organs for DNA damage in cirrhotic rats to predict genetic instability induced by cirrhosis.METHODS: A total of 16 male Wistar rats (negative control, n<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>8; experimental, n<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>8) were submitted to bile duct ligation during 28<U+00A0>days.RESULTS: Cirrhosis was able to induce genetic damage in liver and brain cells, as depicted by the mean tail moment. No genetic damage was induced in blood, heart, or kidney cells (i.e., no significant statistically differences were noticed when compared with negative control).CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results suggest that cirrhosis could contribute to DNA damage in liver and brain cells.","Hepatology international","21484143",2011,"United States"
"Glycolytic inhibition causes spontaneous ventricular fibrillation in aged hearts.","Selective glycolytic inhibition (GI) promotes electromechanical alternans and triggered beats in isolated cardiac myocytes. We sought to determine whether GI promotes triggered activity by early afterdepolarization (EAD) or delayed afterdepolarizations in intact hearts isolated from adult and aged rats. Dual voltage and intracellular calcium ion (Ca(i)(2+)) fluorescent optical maps and single cell glass microelectrode recordings were made from the left ventricular (LV) epicardium of isolated Langendorff-perfused adult (¡«4 mo) and aged (¡«24 mo) rat hearts. GI was induced by replacing glucose with 10 mM pyruvate in oxygenated Tyrode's. Within 20 min, GI slowed Ca(i)(2+) transient decline rate and shortened action potential duration in both groups. These changes were associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the aged hearts (64 out of 66) but not in adult hearts (0 out of 18; P &lt; 0.001). VF was preceded by a transient period of focal ventricular tachycardia caused by EAD-mediated triggered activity leading to VF within seconds. The VF was suppressed by the ATP-sensitive K (K(ATP)) channel blocker glibenclamide (1 ¦ÌM) but not (0 out of 7) by mitochondrial K(ATP) block. The Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocker KN-93 (1 ¦ÌM) prevented GI-mediated VF (P &lt; 0.05). Block of Na-Ca exchanger (NCX) by SEA0400 (2 ¦ÌM) prevented GI-mediated VF (3 out of 6), provided significant bradycardia did not occur. Aged hearts had significantly greater LV fibrosis and reduced connexin 43 than adult hearts (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that in aged fibrotic unlike in adult rat hearts, GI promotes EADs, triggered activity, and VF by activation of K(ATP) channels CaMKII and NCX.","American journal of physiology.

We therefore examined whether ameliorating the postprandial state by ¦Á-GI leads to an improvement in arterial stiffness.</AbstractText>: Aims/Introduction:<U+2002> Although the improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia by an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (¦Á-GI) has been associated with a risk reduction of cardiovascular events, the relationship between postprandial hyperglycemia and arterial stiffness has not been well understood. We therefore examined whether ameliorating the postprandial state by ¦Á-GI leads to an improvement in arterial stiffness.MATERIALS AND METHODS: <U+2002> A total of 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with acarbose. Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) as the arterial stiffness was measured by using a VaSera CAVI instrument before and 12<U+2003>months after acarbose treatment. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), pentraxin-3 (PTX3) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2, -9 were measured at the same time points. Furthermore, circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells were examined for the frequencies of CD14 positive cells expressing membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) at the single cell level using flow cytometry.RESULTS: <U+2002> After acarbose treatment, postprandial glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were significantly decreased. Serum levels of hs-CRP, PTX3, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased. CAVI showed a significant reduction, although the changes were not significant in blood pressure and heart rate. MT1-MMP expression was significantly decreased by acarbose treatment. In multivariate analysis, improvement of blood glucose, decrease of PTX3 levels and MT1-MMP expression were independent predictors of beneficial change in CAVI.CONCLUSIONS: <U+2002> The present study showed that the beneficial effects of acarbose on arterial stiffness are mediated by an improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular remodeling markers. In conclusion, acarbose treatment might reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by altering the arterial stiffness in postprandial hyperglycemic status.

"Clonogenic assay: adherent cells.","The clonogenic (or colony forming) assay has been established for more than 50 years; the original paper describing the technique was published in 1956. Apart from documenting the method, the initial landmark study generated the first radiation-dose response curve for X-ray irradiated mammalian (HeLa) cells in culture. Basically, the clonogenic assay enables an assessment of the differences in reproductive viability (capacity of cells to produce progeny; i.e. a single cell to form a colony of 50 or more cells) between control untreated cells and cells that have undergone various treatments such as exposure to ionising radiation, various chemical compounds (e.g. cytotoxic agents) or in other cases genetic manipulation. The assay has become the most widely accepted technique in radiation biology and has been widely used for evaluating the radiation sensitivity of different cell lines. Further, the clonogenic assay is commonly used for monitoring the efficacy of radiation modifying compounds and for determining the effects of cytotoxic agents and other anti-cancer therapeutics on colony forming ability, in different cell lines. A typical clonogenic survival experiment using adherent cells lines involves three distinct components, 1) treatment of the cell monolayer in tissue culture flasks, 2) preparation of single cell suspensions and plating an appropriate number of cells in petri dishes and 3) fixing and staining colonies following a relevant incubation period, which could range from 1-3 weeks, depending on the cell line. Here we demonstrate the general procedure for performing the clonogenic assay with adherent cell lines with the use of an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (FEP-1811). Also, our aims are to describe common features of clonogenic assays including calculation of the plating efficiency and survival fractions after exposure of cells to radiation, and to exemplify modification of radiation-response with the use of a natural antioxidant formulation.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","21445039",2011,"United States"
"The role of single cell derived vascular resident endothelial progenitor cells in the enhancement of vascularization in scaffold-based skin regeneration.","Increasing evidence suggests that vascular resident endothelial progenitor cells (VR-EPCs) are present in several organs, playing an important role in postnatal neovascularization. Here, we isolated and characterized VR-EPCs from cardiac tissue in vitro, evaluating their regenerative potential in vivo. VR-EPCs showed to be highly clonogenic and expressed several stem and differentiation markers. Under endothelial differentiation conditions, cells form capillary-like structures, in contrast to osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation conditions where no functional changes were observed. After seeding in scaffolds, cells were distributed homogeneously and directly attached to the scaffold. Then, cell seeded scaffolds were used to induce dermal regeneration in a nude mice full skin defect model. The presence of VR-EPCs enhanced dermal vascularization. Histological assays showed increased vessel number (p<U+00A0>&lt;<U+00A0>0.05) and cellularization (p<U+00A0>&lt;<U+00A0>0.05) in VR-EPCs group. In order to explore possible mechanisms of vascular regeneration, in vitro experiments were performed. Results showed that pro-angiogenic environments increased the migration capacity (p<U+00A0>&lt;<U+00A0>0.001) and ability to form capillary-like structures (p<U+00A0>&lt;<U+00A0>0.05) of VR-EPC. In addition, VR-EPCs secreted several pro-angiogenic molecules including VEGF and PDGF. These results indicate that a highly clonogenic population of VR-EPCs might be established in vitro, representing a new source for therapeutic vascularization in tissue engineering and regeneration.","Biomaterials","21435711",2011,"Netherlands"
"FGF8 signaling is chemotactic for cardiac neural crest cells.","Cardiac neural crest cells migrate into the pharyngeal arches where they support development of the pharyngeal arch arteries. The pharyngeal endoderm and ectoderm both express high levels of FGF8. We hypothesized that FGF8 is chemotactic for cardiac crest cells. To begin testing this hypothesis, cardiac crest was explanted for migration assays under various conditions. Cardiac neural crest cells migrated more in response to FGF8. Single cell tracing indicated that this was not due to proliferation and subsequent transwell assays showed that the cells migrate toward an FGF8 source. The migratory response was mediated by FGF receptors (FGFR) 1 and 3 and MAPK/ERK intracellular signaling. To test whether FGF8 is chemokinetic and/or chemotactic in vivo, dominant negative FGFR1 was electroporated into the premigratory cardiac neural crest. Cells expressing the dominant negative receptor migrated slower than normal cardiac neural crest cells and were prone to remain in the vicinity of the neural tube and die. Treating with the FGFR1 inhibitor, SU5402 or an FGFR3 function-blocking antibody also slowed neural crest migration. FGF8 over-signaling enhanced neural crest migration. Neural crest cells migrated to an FGF8-soaked bead placed dorsal to the pharynx. Finally, an FGF8 producing plasmid was electroporated into an ectopic site in the ventral pharyngeal endoderm. The FGF8 producing cells attracted a thick layer of mesenchymal cells. DiI labeling of the neural crest as well as quail-to-chick neural crest chimeras showed that neural crest cells migrated to and around the ectopic site of FGF8 expression. These results showing that FGF8 is chemotactic and chemokinetic for cardiac neural crest adds another dimension to understanding the relationship of FGF8 and cardiac neural crest in cardiovascular defects.","Developmental biology","21419761",2011,"United States"
"Automaticity in acute ischemia: bifurcation analysis of a human ventricular model.","Acute ischemia (restriction in blood supply to part of the heart as a result of myocardial infarction) induces major changes in the electrophysiological properties of the ventricular tissue. Extracellular potassium concentration ([K(o)(+)]) increases in the ischemic zone, leading to an elevation of the resting membrane potential that creates an &quot;injury current&quot; (I(S)) between the infarcted and the healthy zone. In addition, the lack of oxygen impairs the metabolic activity of the myocytes and decreases ATP production, thereby affecting ATP-sensitive potassium channels (I(Katp)). Frequent complications of myocardial infarction are tachycardia, fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death, but the mechanisms underlying their initiation are still debated. One hypothesis is that these arrhythmias may be triggered by abnormal automaticity. We investigated the effect of ischemia on myocyte automaticity by performing a comprehensive bifurcation analysis (fixed points, cycles, and their stability) of a human ventricular myocyte model [K. H. W. J. ten Tusscher and A. V. Panfilov, Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 291, H1088 (2006)] as a function of three ischemia-relevant parameters [K(o)(+)], I(S), and I(Katp). In this single-cell model, we found that automatic activity was possible only in the presence of an injury current. Changes in [K(o)(+)] and I(Katp) significantly altered the bifurcation structure of I(S), including the occurrence of early-after depolarization. The results provide a sound basis for studying higher-dimensional tissue structures representing an ischemic heart.","Physical review.

"Furosemide-induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in the hepatocytes, but weak genotoxicity in the bone marrow cells of mice.","Furosemide (FS) is a potent loop diuretic widely used in the management of fluid retention associated with cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure as well as for the treatment of hypertension. FS is a well-characterized and known hepatotoxin in both human and animal test systems. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the in vivo genotoxicity of FS at the hepatotoxic equivalent doses using the chromosomal aberration and the comet assay in the bone marrow cells of mice as the endpoints of evaluation. The animals were treated with FS at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/body weight (bw) intraperitoneal (ip) for both single (24 h) and repeated dose (seven consecutive days) toxicity studies. FS toxicity in the hepatocytes was evaluated using the parameters, such as, alanine-/aspartate-aminotransferase (ALT/AST), single cell gel electrophoresis (comet), tissue histology, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL assay as the endpoints. The results clearly demonstrate that FS produced toxic responses in the hepatocytes as evident from increased ALT/AST level, DNA damage, TUNEL positive cells and increased DNA fragmentation in mice in vivo. However, it is interesting that in bone marrow cells, FS did not induced structural chromosomal abberations, but produced mild DNA strand breaks as observed by the comet assay. So it is considered as weak genotoxic toward the bone marrow cells when compared to the hepatocytes of mice.","Fundamental &amp; clinical pharmacology","21352352",2011,"England"
"Myocardial implantation of a combination stem cell product by using a transendocardial MYOSTAR injection catheter: A technical assessment.","AIM: Different types of progenitor cells have been used to improve cardiac conditions after myocardial infarction (MI). Results have shown that while the infusion of a single cell type is safe and feasible, efficacy is modest. Recently, the use of a combination, rather than a single, stem cell product has emerged as an attractive option to improve cardiac outcome after a MI. Before initiating a phase II clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy after the transendocardial infusion of a combination stem cell product, a bench testing assay was designed to validate that delivery through the injection catheter is not associated with cell loss/damage. The latter is important since mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a component of the cell product, consist of large cells expressing matrix molecules and adhesive receptors.METHODS: The cell product (a mixture of mononuclear cells and MSC) was sequentially injected through a Myostar injection catheter. Exiting fractions were assessed for cell number, viability, capability to restart cell growth and immunophenotype.RESULTS: Cell recovery and viability were high. In turn, exiting cells preserved their biological properties and immunophenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of cells through a Myostar catheter is safe and not associated with changes in cell survival and/or properties.","Acute cardiac care","21323410",2011,"England"
"Single cell transcriptional profiling reveals heterogeneity of human induced pluripotent stem cells.","Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are promising candidate cell sources for regenerative medicine. However, despite the common ability of hiPSCs and hESCs to differentiate into all 3 germ layers, their functional equivalence at the single cell level remains to be demonstrated. Moreover, single cell heterogeneity amongst stem cell populations may underlie important cell fate decisions. Here, we used single cell analysis to resolve the gene expression profiles of 362 hiPSCs and hESCs for an array of 42 genes that characterize the pluripotent and differentiated states. Comparison between single hESCs and single hiPSCs revealed markedly more heterogeneity in gene expression levels in the hiPSCs, suggesting that hiPSCs occupy an alternate, less stable pluripotent state. hiPSCs also displayed slower growth kinetics and impaired directed differentiation as compared with hESCs. Our results suggest that caution should be exercised before assuming that hiPSCs occupy a pluripotent state equivalent to that of hESCs, particularly when producing differentiated cells for regenerative medicine aims.","The Journal of clinical investigation","21317531",2011,"United States"
"Using induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate cardiac phenotypes in Timothy syndrome.","Individuals with congenital or acquired prolongation of the QT interval, or long QT syndrome (LQTS), are at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. LQTS is commonly genetic in origin but can also be caused or exacerbated by environmental factors. A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome. To explore the effect of the Timothy syndrome mutation on the electrical activity and contraction of human cardiomyocytes, we reprogrammed human skin cells from Timothy syndrome patients to generate induced pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated these cells into cardiomyocytes. Electrophysiological recording and calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging studies of these cells revealed irregular contraction, excess Ca(2+) influx, prolonged action potentials, irregular electrical activity and abnormal calcium transients in ventricular-like cells. We found that roscovitine, a compound that increases the voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 (refs 6-8), restored the electrical and Ca(2+) signalling properties of cardiomyocytes from Timothy syndrome patients. This study provides new opportunities for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias in humans, and provides a robust assay for developing new drugs to treat these diseases.","Nature","21307850",2011,"United States"
"Mesenchymal stem cell derived hematopoietic cells are permissive to HIV-1 infection.","BACKGROUND: Tissue resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, self-renewing cells known for their differentiation potential into cells of mesenchymal lineage. The ability of single cell clones isolated from adipose tissue resident MSCs (ASCs) to differentiate into cells of hematopoietic lineage has been previously demonstrated. In the present study, we investigated if the hematopoietic differentiated (HD) cells derived from ASCs could productively be infected with HIV-1.RESULTS: HD cells were generated by differentiating clonally expanded cultures of adherent subsets of ASCs (CD90+, CD105+, CD45-, and CD34-). Transcriptome analysis revealed that HD cells acquire a number of elements that increase their susceptibility for HIV-1 infection, including HIV-1 receptor/co-receptor and other key cellular cofactors. HIV-1 infected HD cells (HD-HIV) showed elevated p24 protein and gag and tat gene expression, implying a high and productive infection. HD-HIV cells showed decreased CD4, but significant increase in the expression of CCR5, CXCR4, Nef-associated factor HCK, and Vpu-associated factor BTRC. HIV-1 restricting factors like APOBEC3F and TRIM5 also showed up regulation. HIV-1 infection increased apoptosis and cell cycle regulatory genes in HD cells. Although undifferentiated ASCs failed to show productive infection, HIV-1 exposure increased the expression of several hematopoietic lineage associated genes such as c-Kit, MMD2, and IL-10.CONCLUSIONS: Considering the presence of profuse amounts of ASCs in different tissues, these findings suggest the possible role that could be played by HD cells derived from ASCs in HIV-1 infection. The undifferentiated ASCs were non-permissive to HIV-1 infection; however, HIV-1 exposure increased the expression of some hematopoietic lineage related genes. The findings relate the importance of ASCs in HIV-1 research and facilitate the understanding of the disease process and management strategies.","Retrovirology","21226936",2011,"United States"
"Sequential dissection of multiple ionic currents in single cardiac myocytes under action potential-clamp.","The cardiac action potential (AP) is shaped by myriad ionic currents. In this study, we develop an innovative AP-clamp Sequential Dissection technique to enable the recording of multiple ionic currents in the single cell under AP-clamp. This new technique presents a significant step beyond the traditional way of recording only one current in any one cell. The ability to measure many currents in a single cell has revealed two hitherto unknown characteristics of the ionic currents in cardiac cells: coordination of currents within a cell and large variation of currents between cells. Hence, the AP-clamp Sequential Dissection method provides a unique and powerful tool for studying individual cell electrophysiology.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","21215755",2011,"United States"
"Determinants of heterogeneity, excitation and conduction in the sinoatrial node: a model study.","The sinoatrial node (SAN) is a complex structure that exhibits anatomical and functional heterogeneity which may depend on: 1) The existence of distinct cell populations, 2) electrotonic influences of the surrounding atrium, 3) the presence of a high density of fibroblasts, and 4) atrial cells intermingled within the SAN. Our goal was to utilize a computer model to predict critical determinants and modulators of excitation and conduction in the SAN. We built a theoretical &quot;non-uniform&quot; model composed of distinct central and peripheral SAN cells and a &quot;uniform&quot; model containing only central cells connected to the atrium. We tested the effects of coupling strength between SAN cells in the models, as well as the effects of fibroblasts and interspersed atrial cells. Although we could simulate single cell experimental data supporting the &quot;multiple cell type&quot; hypothesis, 2D &quot;non-uniform&quot; models did not simulate expected tissue behavior, such as central pacemaking. When we considered the atrial effects alone in a simple homogeneous &quot;uniform&quot; model, central pacemaking initiation and impulse propagation in simulations were consistent with experiments. Introduction of fibroblasts in our simulated tissue resulted in various effects depending on the density, distribution, and fibroblast-myocyte coupling strength. Incorporation of atrial cells in our simulated SAN tissue had little effect on SAN electrophysiology. Our tissue model simulations suggest atrial electrotonic effects as plausible to account for SAN heterogeneity, sequence, and rate of propagation. Fibroblasts can act as obstacles, current sinks or shunts to conduction in the SAN depending on their orientation, density, and coupling.","PLoS computational biology","21203483",2011,"United States"
"Enumeration of functional T-cell subsets by fluorescence-immunospot defines signatures of pathogen burden in tuberculosis.","BACKGROUND: IFN-¦Ã and IL-2 cytokine-profiles define three functional T-cell subsets which may correlate with pathogen load in chronic intracellular infections. We therefore investigated the feasibility of the immunospot platform to rapidly enumerate T-cell subsets by single-cell IFN-¦Ã/IL-2 cytokine-profiling and establish whether immunospot-based T-cell signatures distinguish different clinical stages of human tuberculosis infection.METHODS: We used fluorophore-labelled anti-IFN-¦Ã and anti-IL-2 antibodies with digital overlay of spatially-mapped colour-filtered images to enumerate dual and single cytokine-secreting M. tuberculosis antigen-specific T-cells in tuberculosis patients and in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). We validated results against established measures of cytokine-secreting T-cells.RESULTS: Fluorescence-immunospot correlated closely with single-cytokine enzyme-linked-immunospot for IFN-¦Ã-secreting T-cells and IL-2-secreting T-cells and flow-cytometry-based detection of dual IFN-¦Ã/IL-2-secreting T-cells. The untreated tuberculosis signature was dominated by IFN-¦Ã-only-secreting T-cells which shifted consistently in longitudinally-followed patients during treatment to a signature dominated by dual IFN-¦Ã/IL-2-secreting T-cells in treated patients. The LTBI signature differed from active tuberculosis, with higher proportions of IL-2-only and IFN-¦Ã/IL-2-secreting T-cells and lower proportions of IFN-¦Ã-only-secreting T-cells.CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence-immunospot is a quantitative, accurate measure of functional T-cell subsets; identification of cytokine-signatures of pathogen burden, distinct clinical stages of M. tuberculosis infection and long-term immune containment suggests application for treatment monitoring and vaccine evaluation.","PloS one","21179481",2010,"United Kingdom"
"[Overexpression of SERCA2a by gene transfer enhances myocardial systolic function in canines].","The present study is aimed to study the effect of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) gene transfer on the contractile function of isolated cardiomyocytes of canines. The cardiomyocytes were isolated with collagenases. The isolated cardiac cells were divided into untransfected group, empty vector group and SERCA2a-transfected group. Recombinant adenovirus vector carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein gene was used for SERCA2a gene delivery. The expression of SERCA2a protein in cardiomyocytes was determined by Western blot. Contractile function of cardiomyocytes was measured with motion edge-detection system of single cell at 48 h after transfection. The results showed, compared with untransfected group, SERCA2a protein level, percentage of peak contraction amplitude under normal condition, percentages of peak contraction amplitude under Ca(2+) or isoproterenol stimulation, time-to-peak contraction (TTP) and time-to-50% relaxation (R50) in SERCA2a-transfected group all increased significantly. While all the above indices in empty vector group did not show any differences with those in untransfected group. These results suggest that the overexpression of SERCA2a by gene transfer may enhance the contraction function of canine myocardial cells.","Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica]","21170496",2010,"China"
"Mitral valve endothelial cells with osteogenic differentiation potential.","OBJECTIVE: Cardiac valvular endothelium is unique in its ability to undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, a differentiation process that is essential for valve development and has been proposed as mechanism for replenishing the interstitial cells of mature valves. We hypothesized that the valvular endothelium contains endothelial cells that are direct precursors to osteoblastic valvular interstitial cells (VICs).METHODS AND RESULTS: Clonal cell populations from ovine mitral valve leaflets were isolated by single cell plating. Mitral valvular endothelial and mesenchymal clones were tested for osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation, determined by the expression of lineage-specific markers. Mitral valvular endothelial clones showed a propensity for osteogenic, as well as chondrogenic differentiation that was comparable to a mitral valvular VIC clone and to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Osteogenic differentiation was not detected in nonvalvular endothelial cells. Regions of osteocalcin expression, a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, were detected along the endothelium of mitral valves that had been subjected in vivo to mechanical stretch.CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve leaflets contain endothelial cells with multilineage mesenchymal differentiation potential, including osteogenic differentiation. This unique feature suggests that postnatal mitral valvular endothelium harbors a reserve of progenitor cells that can contribute to osteogenic and chondrogenic VICs.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","21164078",2010,"United States"
"In vitro and in vivo cardiomyogenic differentiation of amniotic fluid stem cells.","Cell therapy has developed as a complementary treatment for myocardial regeneration. While both autologous and allogeneic uses have been advocated, the ideal candidate has not been identified yet. Amniotic fluid-derived stem (AFS) cells are potentially a promising resource for cell therapy and tissue engineering of myocardial injuries. However, no information is available regarding their use in an allogeneic context. c-kit-sorted, GFP-positive rat AFS (GFP-rAFS) cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (rCMs) were characterized by cytocentrifugation and flow cytometry for the expression of mesenchymal, embryonic and cell lineage-specific antigens. The activation of the myocardial gene program in GFP-rAFS cells was induced by co-culture with rCMs. The stem cell differentiation was evaluated using immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and single cell electrophysiology. The in vivo potential of Endorem-labeled GFP-rAFS cells for myocardial repair was studied by transplantation in the heart of animals with ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R), monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three weeks after injection a small number of GFP-rAFS cells acquired an endothelial or smooth muscle phenotype and to a lesser extent CMs. Despite the low GFP-rAFS cells count in the heart, there was still an improvement of ejection fraction as measured by MRI. rAFS cells have the in vitro propensity to acquire a cardiomyogenic phenotype and to preserve cardiac function, even if their potential may be limited by poor survival in an allogeneic setting.","Stem cell reviews and reports","21120638",2010,"United Kingdom"

The most prominent example is drug induced ventricular tachycardia of the Torsade des Pointes type. The mechanism how this type of arrhythmia develops is a complex multi-cellular phenomenon. It can only be insufficiently reflected by cellular or molecular assays. However, organ models - such as Langendorff hearts - or in vivo experiments are expensive and time consuming and not suitable for assays requiring an increased throughput.AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: here, we describe and review an assay bridging the gap between cardiomyocyte based assays and organ based systems - cardiac slices. This assay is reviewed in direct comparison with established safety pharmacological assays.WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: while slices have played an important role in brain research for &gt; 2 decades, cardiac slices are experiencing a renaissance due to the novel challenges in safety pharmacology just in the last few years. Cardiac slices can be cultured and recorded over several days. It is possible to access electrophysiological data with a high number of electrodes - up to 256 electrodes - embedded in the surface of a microelectrode array.TAKE HOME MESSAGE: cardiac slices close the gap between cellular and organ based assays in cardiac safety pharmacology.

"High-content screening of drug-induced cardiotoxicity using quantitative single cell imaging cytometry on microfluidic device.","Drug-induced cardiotoxicity or cytotoxicity followed by cell death in cardiac muscle is one of the major concerns in drug development. Herein, we report a high-content quantitative multicolor single cell imaging tool for automatic screening of drug-induced cardiotoxicity in an intact cell. A tunable multicolor imaging system coupled with a miniaturized sample platform was destined to elucidate drug-induced cardiotoxicity via simultaneous quantitative monitoring of intracellular sodium ion concentration, potassium ion channel permeability and apoptosis/necrosis in H9c2(2-1) cell line. Cells were treated with cisapride (a human ether-¨¤-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel blocker), digoxin (Na(+)/K(+)-pump blocker), camptothecin (anticancer agent) and a newly synthesized anti-cancer drug candidate (SH-03). Decrease in potassium channel permeability in cisapride-treated cells indicated that it can also inhibit the trafficking of the hERG channel. Digoxin treatment resulted in an increase of intracellular [Na(+)]. However, it did not affect potassium channel permeability. Camptothecin and SH-03 did not show any cytotoxic effect at normal use (¡Ü300 nM and 10 ¦ÌM, respectively). This result clearly indicates the potential of SH-03 as a new anticancer drug candidate. The developed method was also used to correlate the cell death pathway with alterations in intracellular [Na(+)]. The developed protocol can directly depict and quantitate targeted cellular responses, subsequently enabling an automated, easy to operate tool that is applicable to drug-induced cytotoxicity monitoring with special reference to next generation drug discovery screening. This multicolor imaging based system has great potential as a complementary system to the conventional patch clamp technique and flow cytometric measurement for the screening of drug cardiotoxicity.","Lab on a chip","21060932",2010,"England"
"Pressor effect of apelin-13 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla: role of NAD(P)H oxidase-derived superoxide.","Microinjection of apelin-13 into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in the brainstem increases blood pressure in rats. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that apelin-13 directly stimulates neuronal activity in neurons cultured from the brainstem and that NAD(P)H oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species are involved in this action of apelin-13. Microinjection of apelin-13 into the RVLM resulted in increases in arterial pressure and in renal sympathetic nerve activity in Sprague-Dawley rats. The pressor effect of apelin-13 was attenuated by the specific NAD(P)H-oxidase inhibitor gp91ds-tat. In neurons cultured from the ventral brainstem, spontaneous action potentials were recorded using current-clamp recording. Superfusion of neurons with apelin-13 (100 nM) increased the neuronal firing rate from 0.79 ¡À 0.14 to 1.45 ¡À 0.26 Hz (n = 7, P &lt; 0.01) in angiotensin II receptor-like 1-positive neurons, identified with single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Neither the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan nor the angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist 1-[[4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl[methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid ditrifluoroacetate (PD123319) altered the positive chronotropic effect of apelin-13. Pretreatment of cells with either the reactive oxygen species scavenger superoxide dismutase [polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), 25 U/ml] or with gp91ds-tat significantly attenuated the chronotropic action of apelin-13. PEG-SOD and gp91ds-tat alone had no effect on basal neuronal firing. In addition, apelin-13 significantly increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity and elevated intracellular superoxide levels in neuronal cultures. The superoxide generator xanthine-xanthine oxidase also increased neuronal activity in neurons, mimicking the neuronal response to apelin-13. These observations provide the first evidence that apelin-13 directly increases neuronal activity via stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidase-derived superoxide, a cellular signaling mechanism that may be involved in the pressor effect of apelin-13 in the RVLM.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","21047952",2010,"United States"
"Single cell deposition and patterning with a robotic system.","Integrating single-cell manipulation techniques in traditional and emerging biological culture systems is challenging. Microfabricated devices for single cell studies in particular often require cells to be spatially positioned at specific culture sites on the device surface. This paper presents a robotic micromanipulation system for pick-and-place positioning of single cells. By integrating computer vision and motion control algorithms, the system visually tracks a cell in real time and controls multiple positioning devices simultaneously to accurately pick up a single cell, transfer it to a desired substrate, and deposit it at a specified location. A traditional glass micropipette is used, and whole- and partial-cell aspiration techniques are investigated to manipulate single cells. Partially aspirating cells resulted in an operation speed of 15 seconds per cell and a 95% success rate. In contrast, the whole-cell aspiration method required 30 seconds per cell and achieved a success rate of 80%. The broad applicability of this robotic manipulation technique is demonstrated using multiple cell types on traditional substrates and on open-top microfabricated devices, without requiring modifications to device designs. Furthermore, we used this serial deposition process in conjunction with an established parallel cell manipulation technique to improve the efficiency of single cell capture from ¡«80% to 100%. Using a robotic micromanipulation system to position single cells on a substrate is demonstrated as an effective stand-alone or bolstering technology for single-cell studies, eliminating some of the drawbacks associated with standard single-cell handling and manipulation techniques.","PloS one","21042403",2010,"United States"
"Effects of ¦Â-adrenoceptor stimulation on delayed rectifier K(+) currents in canine ventricular cardiomyocytes.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While the slow delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) is known to be enhanced by the stimulation of ¦Â-adrenoceptors in several mammalian species, phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)) is controversial.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In the present study, therefore, the effect of isoprenaline (ISO), activators and inhibitors of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway on I(Kr) and I(Ks) was studied in canine ventricular myocytes using the whole cell patch clamp technique.KEY RESULTS: I (Kr) was significantly increased (by 30-50%) following superfusion with ISO, forskolin or intracellular application of PKA activator cAMP analogues (cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, 6-Bnz-cAMP). Inhibition of PKA by Rp-8-Br-cAMP had no effect on baseline I(Kr). The stimulating effect of ISO on I(Kr) was completely inhibited by selective ¦Â<U+2081>-adrenoceptor antagonists (metoprolol and CGP-20712A), by the PKA inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cAMP and by the PKA activator cAMP analogues, but not by the EPAC activator 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP. In comparison, I(Ks) was increased threefold by the activation of PKA (by ISO or 8-Br-cAMP), and strongly reduced by the PKA inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cAMP. The ISO-induced enhancement of I(Ks) was decreased by Rp-8-Br-cAMP and completely inhibited by 8-Br-cAMP.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The results indicate that the stimulation of ¦Â<U+2081>-adrenoceptors increases I(Kr), similar to I(Ks), via the activation of PKA in canine ventricular cells.","British journal of pharmacology","20973780",2010,"England"
"Triggered by asphyxia neurogenesis seems not to be an endogenous repair mechanism, gliogenesis more like it.","We analyzed the long-term consequences of asphyxial cardiac arrest for hippocampal cell proliferation in rats to evaluate if the ischaemia-induced degenerated CA1 region may be repopulated by endogenous (stem) cells. Studies were performed in an asphyxial cardiac arrest model with 5 minutes of asphyxiation and three different survival times: 7, 21, and 90 days. Sham-operated non-asphyxiated rats served as control. Cell proliferation was studied by labeling dividing cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). The neurodegenerative/regenerative pattern at single cell levels was monitored by immunohistochemistry. Alterations of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Analysis of BrdU-incorporation demonstrated an increase at 7, 21 as well as 90 days after global ischaemia in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Similar results were found in the dentate gyrus. Differentiation of BrdU-positive cells, investigated by cell phenotype-specific double fluorescent labeling, showed increased neurogenesis only in the dentate gyrus of animals surviving the cardiac arrest for 7 days. The majority of newcomers, especially in the damaged CA1 region, consisted of glial cells. Moreover, asphyxia seemed to be able to induce the migration of microglia and astroglia from adjacent areas into the damaged area and/or the activation of resident cells. In addition, we show microglia proliferation/activation even 90 days after cardiac arrest. This morphological finding was confirmed by PCR analysis. The results indicate that asphyxia triggers cell proliferation in general and gliogenesis in particular - a possible pro-reparative event. Furthermore, from the finding of microglia proliferation up to 90 days after insult we conclude that delayed cell death processes take place which should be considered for further therapy strategies.","Neuroscience","20884331",2010,"United States"
"Hysteresis and bistability in periodically paced cardiac tissue.","Hysteresis in periodically paced cardiac tissue is an important issue due to its relevance to cardiac arrhythmias. In the present paper, the mechanism of hysteresis formation and the related properties are interpreted by numerically investigating the phase I Luo-Rudy model. A formula calculating the width of hysteresis is proposed and well confirmed by numerical simulations. We also find that hysteresis in cardiac tissue shows several characteristics due to couplings among cardiac cells which are absent in a single cell. The influences of the physiological parameters are studied in detail. The model dependence of hysteresis is elucidated by considering a number of well-known models of excitable media. Moreover, the influence of bistability on controlling arrhythmias is revealed.","Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics","20866257",2010,"United States"
"Enhanced Computer Modeling of Cardiac Action Potential Dynamics using Experimental Data-Based Feedback.","Mathematical models of cardiac action potential (AP) dynamics are useful for studying the formation of dynamically significant patterns such as alternans and conduction block. A closed-loop observer is an augmented version of a mathematical model, in which experimental data are supplied to the model through feedback. In this study, tools for observer analysis were applied to a two-variable Karma model of AP dynamics. For a single-cell system, it was confirmed that membrane potential data could be used to reconstruct the system state, and that Luenberger feedback could stabilize the observer. Next an observer with a 1D geometry was tested with microelectrode membrane-potential data from a 2.1cm in vitro canine Purkinje fiber. It was shown that the observer produced more accurate AP duration (APD) estimates than the model by itself. These reconstructed quantities could be used to provide enhanced information to anti-tachyarrhythmic stimulus protocols that depend on real-time measurements.","Computing in cardiology","22391895",2010,"United States"
"Expression and function of the K+ channel KCNQ genes in human arteries.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: KCNQ-encoded voltage-gated potassium channels (K(v) 7) have recently been identified as important anti-constrictor elements in rodent blood vessels but the role of these channels and the effects of their modulation in human arteries remain unknown. Here, we have assessed KCNQ gene expression and function in human arteries ex vivo.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Fifty arteries (41 from visceral adipose tissue, 9 mesenteric arteries) were obtained from subjects undergoing elective surgery. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments using primers specific for all known KCNQ genes and immunohistochemsitry were used to show K(v) 7 channel expression. Wire myography and single cell electrophysiology assessed the function of these channels.KEY RESULTS: KCNQ4 was expressed in all arteries assessed, with variable contributions from KCNQ1, 3 and 5. KCNQ2 was not detected. K(v) 7 channel isoform-dependent staining was revealed in the smooth muscle layer. In functional studies, the K(v) 7 channel blockers, XE991 and linopirdine increased isometric tension and inhibited K(+) currents. In contrast, the K(v) 7.1-specific blocker chromanol 293B did not affect vascular tone. Two K(v) 7 channel activators, retigabine and acrylamide S-1, relaxed preconstricted arteries, actions reversed by XE991. K(v) 7 channel activators also suppressed spontaneous contractile activity in seven arteries, reversible by XE991.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate not only the presence of KCNQ gene products in human arteries but also their contribution to vascular tone ex vivo.LINKED ARTICLE: This article is commented on by Mani and Byron, pp. 38-41 of this issue.

"Effects of thienopyridines and thienopyrimidinones on L-type calcium current in isolated cardiomyocytes.","Thienopyridines (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) are frequently used drugs in antiplatelet therapy and have been shown to exert a more pronounced negative inotropic effect than thienopyrimidinones. We hypothesized that these differences are due to a differential impact of thienopyridines and thienopyrimidinones on L-type calcium current at the single-cell level. The effects of thienopyridines and thienopyrimidinones were studied on L-type calcium current and action potential parameters with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in isolated myocytes from guinea pig ventricle and human atrial appendage. Ticlopidine showed the greatest impact on the L-type calcium current in guinea pig myocytes. It significantly reduced L-type calcium current density as well as shifted half maximal inactivation potential to more negative potentials compared to clopidogrel (at 30<U+00A0>¦Ìmol/L) and to all thienopyrimidinones (30 and 100<U+00A0>¦Ìmol/L). Clopidogrel significantly reduced the L-type calcium current density as well as shifted the half maximal inactivation potential to more negative potentials compared to all thienopyrimidinones at 100<U+00A0>¦Ìmol/L only. In contrast, thienopyrimidinones did not affect L-type calcium current properties. The significant different effects of thienopyridines and thienopyrimidinones could also be demonstrated in human atrial myocytes. The more pronounced negative inotropic effect of thienopyridines is well explained by our results demonstrating a differential impairment of L-type calcium current by thienopyridines and thienopyrimidinones. L-type calcium current impairment by thienopyridines may be of special relevance for patients with cardiac diseases characterized by ionic remodelling.","Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology","20838990",2010,"Germany"
"[DNA degradation in nucleolus of skeletal muscle, heart, liver, kidney and brain in mice after death].","OBJECTIVE: To study the change of DNA degradation in nucleolus of mice organs and its relationship with the postmortem interval, and to investigate a new accurate method to estimate the postmortem interval.METHODS: Eight parameters of cell nuclei were chosen, including the head DNA level, the tail DNA level, the head radius, the tail length, the tail moment, the Olive moment, the head area and the tail area. The changes of DNA degradation were analyzed in skeletal muscle, myocardium, liver, kidney and brain in mice at different intervals (0-72 h postmortem) by using single-cell gel electrophoresis and fluorescent microscope connected with auto-analysis-image system.RESULTS: The tail DNA level, the tail length, the tail moment, the Olive moment and the tail area showed an increasing tendency. The head DNA level, the head radius and the head area showed a decreasing tendency within 72h postmortem in mice. A quadratic regression equation (P &lt; 0.001) and multiple regression equation of DNA degradation tendency were established (P &lt; 0.000 1).CONCLUSION: The regression equations established can be used as a new method for estimating postmortem interval in forensic practice.","Fa yi xue za zhi","20707270",2010,"China"
"Role of constitutively active acetylcholine-mediated potassium current in atrial contractile dysfunction caused by atrial tachycardia remodelling.","AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF)-induced contractile dysfunction contributes importantly to thrombo-embolic stroke, the most serious AF complication. Atrial cardiomyocytes have a constitutively active acetylcholine-regulated K(+)-current (I(KAChc)) that is enhanced by atrial tachycardia (AT). I(KAChc) contributes to action potential duration (APD) shortening in AT-remodelled atrial cardiomyocytes; APD regulates contractility by controlling Ca(2+)-loading and systolic Ca(2+)-release. This study investigated the potential role of I(KAChc) in AF-related contractile dysfunction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Dogs were divided into two groups: (i) unpaced control (CTL); (ii) AT (400 bpm for at least 7 days). Tertiapin-Q (TQ), a selective I(KAChc) blocker, was used to define I(KAChc) contributions to contractility. Single-cell left atrial (LA) intracellular Ca(2+)-transients (CaTrs), cell-shortening (CS), and whole LA tissue tension-generation were measured. Atrial tachycardia increased I(KAChc). Whole LA contractility was decreased in AT (0.17 ¡À 0.05 g) compared with CTL (0.40 ¡À 0.09 g), with significant reversal (0.30 ¡À 0.06 g) after TQ administration. Ca(2+)-transient amplitude and CS in single-cell were decreased by AT compared with CTL (167 ¡À 14 vs. 88 ¡À 10 nM; 10.3 ¡À 1.3 vs. 1.7 ¡À 0.3 ¦Ìm, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). The AT-induced reductions in single-cell CaTr amplitude and CS were partly reversed by TQ administration (88 ¡À 10 vs. 112 ¡À 16 nM; P &lt; 0.001; 1.7 ¡À 0.3 vs. 3.6 ¡À 0.7 ¦Ìm; P &lt; 0.01). We then measured CaTr and CS with carbachol and/or TQ to vary I(KACh) at various extracellular [Ca(2+)]. The CaTr-CS relationship was linear and AT results fell on the regression line, indicating that AT-remodelling effects on contractility are attributable to reduced CaTr.CONCLUSION: Up-regulated I(KAChc) contributes to AF-related contractile dysfunction and could be a novel target to prevent hypocontractility-related thrombo-embolic complications.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology","20682556",2010,"Canada"
"Characterization of a novel mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor that results in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. It is primarily caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The mechanism by which these mutations cause arrhythmia remains controversial, with discrepant findings related to the role of the RyR2 binding protein FKBP12.6. The purpose of this study was to characterize a novel RyR2 mutation identified in a kindred with clinically diagnosed CPVT. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing were used to screen the RyR2 gene for mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce the mutation into the mouse RyR2 cDNA. The impact of the mutation on the interaction between RyR2 and a 12.6 kDa FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and its effect on RyR2 function was characterized by single cell Ca(2+) imaging and [(3)H]ryanodine binding. A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6. These observations strengthen the notion that enhanced SOICR, but not altered FKBP12.6 binding, is a common mechanism by which RyR2 mutations cause arrhythmias.","Channels (Austin, Tex.)","20676041",2010,"United States"
"Life and death in the atherosclerotic plaque.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Changes in cell mass in atherosclerosis represent changes in cell division, cell death and migration/emigration, all of which may be occurring simultaneously in different cell types at different times and in different regions of the plaque. This makes measurement of these individual processes and measurement of overall cell kinetics in atherosclerosis difficult, with the challenges and shortfalls only recently becoming apparent. This review will outline the problems associated with assaying cell proliferation and cell death, and how these processes relate to changes in overall cell kinetics and measurement of biological age.RECENT FINDINGS: Cell division and cell death have historically been assayed as frequencies of specific processes, with at times ill-defined and nonspecific markers. More recent studies have moved towards cumulative assays that can measure overall rates over time, resulting in a 'biological' age or replication history of a tissue or cell.SUMMARY: The complexity of processes involved in assaying changes in cell kinetics in atherosclerosis mean that we must move towards cumulative assays of cell proliferation, cell death and senescence that can be measured in the time frames over which atherosclerosis occurs, and for studies that selectively manipulate one of these processes in a single-cell type without affecting other processes.","Current opinion in lipidology","20644473",2010,"United Kingdom"
"Cardiac angioleiomyoma in 44 cattle in Japan (1982-2009).","A retrospective study was performed on primary cardiac tumors found in 44 cattle during meat inspection in Japan, using histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. The age of affected cattle ranged from 10 to 129 months; 82% were less than 3 years old. In 38 hearts, the tumor was solitary; the remaining 6 hearts had multiple masses. All tumors were subendocardial and involved the papillary muscles and/or cardiac valves. Two histologic patterns were recognized; both included giant cells. Pattern 1 was characterized by interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped cells; pattern 2 resembled cavernous hemangioma. The 2 patterns coexisted and were linked by transitional zones. Given the immunohistochemical reactivity and ultrastructure, the spindle-shaped cells were identified as smooth muscle cells and the giant cells as endothelial cells. Single cell and multicellular angiogenesis by giant cells was observed. The tumors were classified as cardiac angioleiomyoma. Subendocardial multipotential mesenchymal cells, persistent tissue of the endocardial cushion, or valvular interstitial cells were suspected as the origin.","Veterinary pathology","20574072",2010,"United States"
"Insights into human beta-cardiac myosin function from single molecule and single cell studies.","beta-Cardiac myosin is a mechanoenzyme that converts the energy from ATP hydrolysis into a mechanical force that drives contractility in muscle. Thirty percent of the point mutations that result in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are localized to MYH7, the gene encoding human beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (beta-MyHC). Force generation by myosins requires a tight and highly conserved allosteric coupling between its different protein domains. Hence, the effects of single point mutations on the force generation and kinetics of beta-cardiac myosin molecules cannot be predicted directly from their location within the protein structure. Great insight would be gained from understanding the link between the functional defect in the myosin protein and the clinical phenotypes of patients expressing them. Over the last decade, several single molecule techniques have been developed to understand in detail the chemomechanical cycle of different myosins. In this review, we highlight the single molecule techniques that can be used to assess the effect of point mutations on beta-cardiac myosin function. Recent bioengineering advances have enabled the micromanipulation of single cardiomyocyte cells to characterize their force-length dynamics. Here, we briefly review single cell micromanipulation as an approach to determine the effect of beta-MyHC mutations on cardiomyocyte function. Finally, we examine the technical challenges specific to studying beta-cardiac myosin function both using single molecule and single cell approaches.","Journal of cardiovascular translational research","20560001",2010,"United States"
"Ionic mechanisms for electrical heterogeneity between rabbit Purkinje fiber and ventricular cells.","The intrinsic heterogeneity of electrical action potential (AP) properties between Purkinje fibers (PFs) and the ventricular wall, as well as within the wall, plays an important role in ensuring successful excitation of the ventricles. It can also be proarrhythmic due to nonuniform repolarization across the Purkinje-ventricular junction. However, the ionic mechanisms that underlie the marked AP differences between PFs and ventricular cells are not fully characterized. We studied such mechanisms by developing a new family of biophysically detailed AP models for rabbit PF cells and three transmural ventricular cell types. The models were based on and validated against experimental data recorded from rabbit at ionic channel, single cell, and tissue levels. They were then used to determine the functional roles of each individual ionic channel current in modulating the AP heterogeneity at the rabbit Purkinje-ventricular junction, and to identify specific currents responsible for the differential response of PFs and ventricular cells to pharmacological interventions.","Biophysical journal","20513385",2010,"United Kingdom"
"Electrophysiological basis of the first heart beats.","AIMS: Earlier studies on cardiac pacemaker activity were inconclusive regarding the electrophysiological mechanism(s) of first electrical activity generation during cardiac development. We therefore aimed to investigate the role of ion channels in action potential (AP) formation and pacemaker activity during very early murine heart development (E8.5).METHODS AND RESULTS: The voltage clamp mode of the whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to study whole cell ion currents at the single cell level. Extracellular field potentials (FPs) of whole mount hearts were recorded by the use of multi-electrodes arrays (MEAs). RT-PCR was performed to study mRNA expression of the tested ion channels. E8.5 cardiomyocytes displayed membrane potential (MP) oscillations, primitive APs but also more mature-like APs. Cells with primitive APs expressed higher levels of Ca(v)1.2, HCN4, Ca(v)3.2 and NCX1 than cells with MP oscillations and mature-like cells expressed higher levels of K(ir)3.1 (P-like) or K(ir)2.1 (V- and A- like) than cells with primitive APs. Blockers of I(CaL) (verapamil+nifedipine), I(NCX) (KB-R7943 and SEA0400), and I(CaT) (Ni(2+)) led to a complete halt of cardiac APs and FPs even when applied alone, while blocker of I(f) (Cs(+)) only suppressed AP/FP frequency.CONCLUSIONS: Our data imply that i) The high expression of Ca(v)1.2, HCN4, Ca(v)3.2, and NCX1 contributed to the shift from MP oscillations to primitive APs at E8.5. ii) Spontaneous AP generation may rely on the sum of transsarcolemmal Ca(2+) influx through I(CaL), I(NCX) and I(CaT) since blockage of each individual ion channel/exchanger led to an immediate halt of beating at E8.5.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","20511701",2010,"Germany"
"A computational model of Purkinje fibre single cell electrophysiology: implications for the long QT syndrome.","Computer modelling has emerged as a particularly useful tool in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac tissues. Models of ventricular, atrial and nodal tissue have evolved and include detailed ion channel kinetics and intercellular Ca(2+) handling. Purkinje fibre cells play a central role in the electrophysiology of the heart and in the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias. In this study, a new computational model has been constructed that incorporates the major membrane currents that have been isolated in recent experiments using Purkinje fibre cells. The model, which integrates mathematical models of human ion channels based on detailed biophysical studies of their kinetic and voltage-dependent properties, recapitulates distinct electrophysiological characteristics unique to Purkinje fibre cells compared to neighbouring ventricular myocytes. These characteristics include automaticity, hyperpolarized voltage range of the action potential plateau potential, and prolonged action potential duration. Simulations of selective ion channel blockade reproduce responses to pharmacological challenges characteristic of isolated Purkinje fibres in vitro, and importantly, the model predicts that Purkinje fibre cells are prone to severe arrhythmogenic activity in patients harbouring long QT syndrome 3 but much less so for other common forms of long QT. This new Purkinje cellular model can be a useful tool to study tissue-specific drug interactions and the effects of disease-related ion channel dysfunction on the cardiac conduction system.","The Journal of physiology","20498233",2010,"United States"
"Long term expansion of undifferentiated human iPS and ES cells in suspension culture using a defined medium.","Therapeutic application of stem cell derivatives requires large quantities of cells produced in defined media that cannot be produced via conventional adherent culture. We have applied human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells expressing eGFP under control of the OCT4 promoter to establish the expansion of undifferentiated human embryonic stem (hES) and hiPS cells in suspension culture. A defined culture medium has been identified that results in up to six-fold increase in cell numbers within four days. Our culture system is based on initial single cell dissociation which is critical for standardized process inoculation. HES / hiPS cells were expanded for up to 17 passages. The cells maintained a stable karyotype, their expression of pluripotency markers and their potential to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. The ability to expand HES / hiPS cells in a scalable suspension culture represents a critical step towards standardized production in stirred bioreactors.","Stem cell research","20478754",2010,"England"
"Mechanistic links between Na+ channel (SCN5A) mutations and impaired cardiac pacemaking in sick sinus syndrome.","RATIONALE: Familial sick sinus syndrome (SSS) has been linked to loss-of-function mutations of the SCN5A gene, which result in decreased inward Na(+) current, I(Na). However, the functional role of I(Na) in cardiac pacemaking is controversial, and mechanistic links between mutations and sinus node dysfunction in SSS are unclear.OBJECTIVE: To determine mechanisms by which the SCN5A mutations impair cardiac pacemaking.METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potential (AP) models for rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cells were modified to incorporate experimentally reported I(Na) changes induced by 2 groups of SCN5A gene mutations (affecting the activation and inactivation of I(Na), respectively). The cell models were incorporated into an anatomically detailed 2D model of the intact SAN-atrium. Effects of the mutations and vagal nerve activity on cardiac pacemaking at the single-cell and tissue levels were studied. Multielectrode extracellular potential recordings of activation pattern from intact SAN-atrium preparations were performed to test predictions of the models. At the single-cell level, the mutations slowed down pacemaking rates in peripheral, but not in central SAN cells that control the heart rhythm. However, in tissue simulations, the mutations not only slowed down pacemaking, but also compromised AP conduction across the SAN-atrium, leading to a possible SAN exit block or sinus arrest, the major features of SSS. Simulated vagal nerve activity amplified the bradycardiac effects of the mutations. Two groups of SCN5A mutations showed subtle differences in impairing the ability of the SAN to drive the surrounding atrium, primarily attributable to their differential effects on atrial excitability and conduction safety. Experimental data with tetrodotoxin and carbachol confirmed the simulation outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Our study substantiates the causative link between SCN5A gene mutations and SSS and illustrates mechanisms by which the mutations impair the driving ability of the SAN.","Circulation research","20448214",2010,"United Kingdom"
"[Identification of genes associated with germination of conidia to form mycelia in the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis].","INTRODUCTION: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dimorphic fungus. At room temperature it grows as a mold that produces conidia, whereas in the vertebrate host it grows as a multiple-budding yeast. The molecular mechanisms involved in the germination from the conidia to the mycelia process remain unknown.OBJECTIVE: The kinetics of conidia to mycelia germination process were studied in the dimorphic fungus P. brasiliensis. Gene expression during this process was evaluated by construction and analysis of an EST library.MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the germination kinetics study, P. brasiliensis conidia were isolated as single cell units. Then, they were cultured at 18 degrees C in BHI (brain-heart infusion) broth for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr. After each perion, they were examined by light microscopy. From conidia harvested at 96 hr, an EST library was constructed; at this stage the gene expression was presumed to be maximal for the germination process.RESULTS: During the conidia to the mycelia developmental process, the following germination rates were observed: at 24 hr, 11.7+/-1.2%; at 48 hr, 30+/-0.6%; at 72 hr, 43+/-1.3%; and at 96 hr, 66+/-2.4%. At the 96 hour stage, an EST library was constructed. It consisted of 129 sequences grouped in 4 contigs and 7 singlets for a total of 11 possible genes.

Genome-wide screens for cell fate determination signals require a cell source that differentiates purely into a single cell type. From adult rat left atrium, we established LA-PCs that differentiates into cardiac/skeletal myocytes or adipocytes with almost 100% purity. In this study, we compared gene expression profiles of undifferentiated LA-PCs with those of differentiated cells [adipocytes (Adi) or cardiac/skeletal myocytes (Myo)] to identify the signals that set the regulatory switch for adipocyte or myocyte differentiation. Microarray analysis verified the feasibility of genome-wide screening by this method. Using a pathway analysis screen, we found that members of the TGF-beta superfamily signal transduction pathways modulate the adipocyte/myocyte differentiation switch. Further analysis determined that recombinant TGF-beta inhibits adipogenesis and induces myogenesis simultaneously in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, noggin induces differentiation into fully developed beating cardiac myocytes in vitro. These results provided new insight into the molecules that modulate the differentiation switch and validated a screening method for their identification.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","20420809",2010,"United States"
"Applications of control theory to the dynamics and propagation of cardiac action potentials.","Sudden cardiac arrest is a widespread cause of death in the industrialized world. Most cases of sudden cardiac arrest are due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), a lethal cardiac arrhythmia. Electrophysiological abnormalities such as alternans (a beat-to-beat alternation in action potential duration) and conduction block have been suspected to contribute to the onset of VF. This study focuses on the use of control-systems techniques to analyze and design methods for suppressing these precursor factors. Control-systems tools, specifically controllability analysis and Lyapunov stability methods, were applied to a two-variable Karma model of the action-potential (AP) dynamics of a single cell, to analyze the effectiveness of strategies for suppressing AP abnormalities. State-feedback-integral (SFI) control was then applied to a Purkinje fiber simulated with the Karma model, where only one stimulating electrode was used to affect the system. SFI control converted both discordant alternans and 2:1 conduction block back toward more normal patterns, over a wider range of fiber lengths and pacing intervals compared with a Pyragas-type chaos controller. The advantages conferred by using feedback from multiple locations in the fiber, and using integral (i.e., memory) terms in the controller, are discussed.","Annals of biomedical engineering","20407833",2010,"United States"
"Active Wnt signaling in response to cardiac injury.","Although the contribution of Wnt signaling in infarct healing is suggested, its exact role after myocardial infarction (MI) still needs to be unraveled. We evaluated the cardiac presence of active Wnt signaling in vivo following MI, and investigated in which cell types active Wnt signaling was present by determining Axin2 promoter-driven LacZ expression. C57BL/6 Axin2-LacZ reporter mice were sacrificed at days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after LAD ligation. Hearts were snap-frozen for immunohistochemistry (IHC) or enzymatically digested to obtain a single cell suspension for flow cytometric analysis. For both FACS and IHC, samples were stained for beta-galactosidase and antibodies against Sca-1, CD31, ckit, and CD45. Active Wnt signaling increased markedly in the myocardium, from 7 days post-MI onwards. Using Sca-1 and CD31, to identify progenitor and endothelial cells, a significant increase in LacZ+ cells was found at 7 and 14 days post-MI. LacZ+ cells also increased in the ckit+ and CD45+ cell population. IHC revealed LacZ+ cells co-expressing Sca, CD31, CD45, vWF, and alphaSMA in the border zone and the infarcted area. Wnt signaling increased significantly after MI in Sca+- and CD31+-expressing cells, suggesting involvement of Wnt signaling in resident Sca+ progenitor cells, as well as endothelial cells. Moreover, active Wnt signaling was present in ckit+ cells, leukocytes, and fibroblast. Given its broad role during the healing phase after cardiac injury, additional research seems warranted before a therapeutic approach on Wnt to enhance cardiac regeneration can be carried out safely.","Basic research in cardiology","20373104",2010,"Germany"

"Expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in rabbit carotid body glomus cells regulates large-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium currents.","Our previous studies show that a decrease in endogenous nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the blunted outward K(+) currents in carotid body (CB) glomus cells from chronic heart failure (CHF) rabbits. In the present study, we measured the effects of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) transgene on the K(+) currents in CB glomus cells from pacing-induced CHF rabbits. Using single-cell real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescent techniques, we found that nNOS mRNA and protein are expressed in the rabbit CB glomus cells and CHF decreased the expression of nNOS mRNA and protein in CB glomus cells. After 3 days of an adenoviral nNOS (Ad.nNOS) gene transfection, the expression of nNOS protein was increased to the level found in sham CB glomus cells. In whole cell patch-clamp experiments, Ad.nNOS markedly reversed the attenuated K(+) currents in CB glomus cells from CHF rabbits. The specific nNOS inhibitor (S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline [SMTC]) and large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channel blocker (iberiotoxin) fully abolished the effect of Ad.nNOS on the K(+) currents in the CB glomus cells from CHF rabbits. However, neither CHF nor Ad.nNOS altered the protein expression of BK channel alpha-subunit. These results suggest that a decrease of NO induced by an attenuated nNOS activity lowers the activation of the BK channels but not the protein expression of the BK channel alpha-subunit in the CB glomus cells during CHF.","Journal of neurophysiology","20357072",2010,"United States"
"Potential of a cytomics top-down strategy for drug discovery.","It takes about 10 to 15 years and roughly 800 mln $ to bring a new drug to the market. Only 10% of drug molecules entering clinical trials succeed and only 3 out of 10 drugs generate enough profit to pay back for the investment. Drug targets may be searched by hypothesis driven modeling of molecular networks within and between cells by systems biology. However, there is the potential to simplify the search for new drugs and drug targets by an initial top-down cytomics phase. The cytomics approach i) requires no detailed a-priori knowledge on mechanisms of drug activity or complex diseases, ii) is hypothesis driven for the investigated parameters (genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome a.o.) and iii) is hypothesis-free for data analysis. Moreover it iv) carries the potential to uncover unknown molecular interrelations as a prerequisite for later new hypothesis driven modeling and research strategies. A set of discriminatory parameter patterns (molecular hotspots) describing the cellular model (mechanism of drug action) can be identified by differential molecular cell phenotyping. Hereby, the immediate modeling of existing complexities by bottom-up oriented systems biology is avoided. The review focuses on the fast technological developments of molecular single cell analysis in recent years. They comprise a multitude of sensitive new molecular markers as well as various new image and flow cytometric high-content screening methods as facilitators of the cytomics concept. New bioinformatic tools enable the extraction of relevant molecular hotspots in description of cellular models, being required for the subsequent molecular reverse engineering phase by systems biology.","Current medicinal chemistry","20345347",2010,"United Arab Emirates"
"Could cells from your nose fix your heart? Transplantation of olfactory stem cells in a rat model of cardiac infarction.","This study examines the hypothesis that multipotent olfactory mucosal stem cells could provide a basis for the development of autologous cell transplant therapy for the treatment of heart attack. In humans, these cells are easily obtained by simple biopsy. Neural stem cells from the olfactory mucosa are multipotent, with the capacity to differentiate into developmental fates other than neurons and glia, with evidence of cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro and after transplantation into the chick embryo. Olfactory stem cells were grown from rat olfactory mucosa. These cells are propagated as neurosphere cultures, similar to other neural stem cells. Olfactory neurospheres were grown in vitro, dissociated into single cell suspensions, and transplanted into the infarcted hearts of congeneic rats. Transplanted cells were genetically engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in order to allow them to be identified after transplantation. Functional assessment was attempted using echocardiography in three groups of rats: control, unoperated; infarct only; infarcted and transplanted. Transplantation of neurosphere-derived cells from adult rat olfactory mucosa appeared to restore heart rate with other trends towards improvement in other measures of ventricular function indicated. Importantly, donor-derived cells engrafted in the transplanted cardiac ventricle and expressed cardiac contractile proteins.","TheScientificWorldJournal","20305985",2010,"United States"
"Hysteresis in human HCN4 channels: a crucial feature potentially affecting sinoatrial node pacemaking.","The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels modulate and regulate cardiac rhythm and rate. It has been suggested that, unlike the HCN1 and HCN2 channels, the slower HCN4 channel may not exhibit voltage-dependent hysteresis. We studied the electrophysiological properties of human HCN4 (hHCN4) channels and its modulation by cAMP to determine whether hHCN4 exhibits hysteresis, by using single-cell patch-clamp in HEK293 cells stably transfected with hHCN4. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was also used to determine levels of expression of HCNs in human cardiac tissue. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed that hHCN4 current (I(h)) activation shifted in the depolarizing direction with more hyperpolarized holding potentials. Triangular ramp and action potential clamp protocols also revealed hHCN4 hysteresis. cAMP enhanced I(h) and shifted activation in the depolarizing direction, thus modifying the intrinsic hHCN4 hysteresis behavior. Quantitative PCR analysis of human sinoatrial node (SAN) tissue showed that HCN4 accounts for 75% of the HCNs in human SAN while HCN1 (21%), HCN2 (3%), and HCN3 (0.7%) constitute the remainder. Our data suggest that HCN4 is the predominant HCN subtype in the human SAN and that I(h) exhibits voltage-dependent hysteresis behavior that can be modified by cAMP. Therefore, hHCN4 hysteresis potentially plays a crucial role in human SAN pacemaking activity.","Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica]","20179882",2010,"China"
"Use of human umbilical cord blood-derived progenitor cells for tissue-engineered heart valves.","BACKGROUND: Tissue engineering of autologous heart valves with the potential to grow and to remodel represents a promising concept. Here we describe the use of cryopreserved umbilical cord blood-derived CD133(+) cells as a single cell source for the tissue engineering of heart valves.METHODS: After expansion and differentiation of CD133(+) cells, phenotypes were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and cryopreserved. Heart valve scaffolds fabricated from a biodegradable polymer (n = 8) were seeded with blood-derived myofibroblasts and subsequently coated with blood-derived endothelial cells. Afterward, the heart valve constructs were grown in a pulse duplicator system. Analysis of all heart valves, including histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical and biomechanical examination, was performed.RESULTS: The tissue-engineered heart valves showed endothelialized layered tissue formation including connective tissue between the inside and the outside of the scaffold. The notion of an intact endothelial phenotype was substantiated by fluorescence imaging studies of cellular nitric oxide production and Ca(2+) signaling. Electron microscopy showed that the cells had grown into the pores and formed a confluent tissue layer. Biochemical examination showed extracellular matrix formation (77% +/- 9% collagen of human pulmonary leaflet tissue [HPLT], 85% +/- 61% glycosaminoglycans of HPLT and 67% +/- 17% elastin of HPLT).CONCLUSIONS: Importantly, this study demonstrates in vitro generation of viable human heart valves based on CD133(+) cells derived from umbilical cord blood. These findings constitute a significant step forward in the development of new clinical strategies for the treatment of congenital defects.","The Annals of thoracic surgery","20172137",2010,"Netherlands"
"Multistability property in cardiac ionic models of mammalian and human ventricular cells.","The underlying mechanisms of irregular cardiac rhythms are still poorly understood. Many experimental and modeling studies are aimed at identifying factors which cause cardiac arrhythmias. However, a lack of understanding of heart rhythm dynamical properties makes it difficult to uncover precise mechanisms of electrical instabilities, and hence to predict the onset of heart rhythm disorders. We review and compare the existing methods of studying cardiac dynamics, including restitution protocol (S1-S2), dynamic restitution protocol and multistability test protocol (S1-CI-S2). We focus on cardiac cell dynamics to elucidate regularities of heart rhythm. We demonstrate the advantages of our newly proposed systematic approach of analysis of cardiac cell dynamics using mammalian Luo Rudy 1991 and human ventricular Ten Tusscher 2006 single cell models under healthy and diseased conditions such as altered K(+) or Ca(2+) related currents. We investigate the role of ionic properties and the shape of an action potential on the nonlinear dynamics of electrical processes in periodically stimulated cardiac cells. We show the existence of multistability property for human ventricular cells. Moreover, the multistability is proposed to be an intrinsic property of cardiac cells, and is also suggested to be one of the mechanisms which could underlie the sudden triggering of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in the human heart.","Progress in biophysics and molecular biology","20153355",2010,"England"
"Sleep loss induces differential response related to genotoxicity in multiple organs of three different mice strains.","The purpose of the present study was to determine the genetic damage induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) in three different male mice strains in peripheral blood, heart, kidney and liver tissues by the single cell gel (comet) assay. Swiss, C57BL/6j and hairless (HRS/j) mice were submitted to PSD by the multiple platform technique for 72 hr, and DNA damage was evaluated. Statistically significant differences in DNA damage were found in blood cells of the Swiss mice strain when compared to negative controls. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found in the C57BL/6j or hairless mice strains. With regard to the liver, extensive genotoxic effects were found in the Swiss strain. The hairless and C57BL/6j mice strains did not show any signs of genotoxocity in this organ. The same lack of effect was noted in kidney and heart cells of all strains evaluated. In conclusion, our results reveal that sleep deprivation exerted genetic damage in the form of DNA breakage in blood and liver cells of the Swiss mice strain only. This type of approach should be considered when studying noxious activities on genetic apparatus induced by sleep deprivation in mice since the Swiss strain is more suitable for this purpose.","Basic &amp; clinical pharmacology &amp; toxicology","20148859",2010,"England"
"Preimplantation genetic haplotyping: 127 diagnostic cycles demonstrating a robust, efficient alternative to direct mutation testing on single cells.","Preimplantation genetic diagnosis using whole genome amplification and a haplotyping approach (PGH) was first described in 2006 and suggested as an efficient alternative to single-cell PCR for monogenic disorders. DNA from single cells was amplified using multiple displacement amplification; the resulting products were then tested using disease-specific PCR multiplexes applied under standard laboratory conditions to determine the haplotypes in the embryo. This study reports on a total of 127 completed biopsy cycles for 101 couples at risk of: autosomal recessive disease (71 cycles, 53 couples including one germ-line mosaic carrier), autosomal dominant disease (31 cycles, 26 couples including one germ-line mosaic carrier), X-linked recessive disease (18 cycles, 16 couples including one germ-line mosaic carrier), X-linked dominant disease (six cycles, five couples) and a double inheritance of both autosomal and X-linked recessive diseases (one cycle, one couple). Of these, 107 cycles reached embryo transfer. Overall success rates were: fetal heart beat-positive pregnancies (FHB+)/biopsy cycle=28%; FHB+/embryo transfer=34%; FHB+/couple=36%; 26 babies born, 13 ongoing pregnancies. These data demonstrate that PGH provides a robust, efficient and successful alternative to single-cell PCR for monogenic diseases.","Reproductive biomedicine online","20144563",2010,"Netherlands"
"Modulation of intracellular calcium transient in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the hearts of 4-wk-old rats during simulated weightlessness.","Modulation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) transient in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the hearts of hindlimb unweighted (HLU) rats during simulated weightlessness has not been reported. In the present study, we adopted the rat tail suspension for 4 wk to simulate weightlessness. Effects of simulated microgravity on beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness were then studied. Mean arterial blood pressure, left ventricular pressure (LVP), systolic function [maximum positive change in pressure over time (+dP/dt(max))], and diastolic function [maximum negative change in pressure over time (-dP/dt(max))] were monitored during the in vivo experiment. beta-Adrenoceptor density was quantitated by radioactive ligand binding. Single rat ventricular myocyte was obtained by enzymatic dissociation method. +/-dP/dt(max), myocyte contraction, intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) transient, and L-type calcium current in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoproterenol were measured. Compared with the control group, no significant changes were found in heart weight, body weight, and mean arterial blood pressure, whereas LVP and +/-dP/dt(max) were significantly reduced. LVP and +/-dP/dt(max) were significantly attenuated in the HLU group in response to isoproterenol administration. In the in vitro study, the beta-adrenoceptor density was unchanged. Effects of isoproterenol on electrically induced single-cell contraction and [Ca(2+)](i) transient in myocytes of ventricles in HLU rats were significantly attenuated. The enhanced L-type Ca(2+) current elicited by isoproterenol in cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased in the HLU group. The above results indicate that impaired function of L-type Ca(2+) current and decreased [Ca(2+)](i) transient cause the depressed responsiveness of the beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, which may be partially responsible for the depression of cardiac function.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","20133438",2010,"United States"

Through the increasing of the concentration of extracellular K+, we simulated the propagation of spiral wave in a condition under the influence of ischemia in 2-D human ventricular tissue. The results showed that along with the increase of ischemic level and size, the instability of spiral waves increased, and under the influence of certain ischemic level and size, spiral waves broke up. Through this simulation study of the effects of ischemia on spiral waves in 2-D human ventricular tissue, we explained the corresponding mechanism of the maintenance of ventricular tachycardia and the cause of ventricular fibrillation under the influence of ischemia.","Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi","20095497",2010,"China"
"Nicotinamide-rich diet protects the heart against ischaemia-reperfusion in mice: a crucial role for cardiac SUR2A.","It is a consensus view that a strategy to increase heart resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion is a warranted. Here, based on our previous study, we have hypothesized that a nicotinamide-rich diet could increase myocardial resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether nicotinamide-rich diet would increase heart resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion and what is the underlying mechanism. Experiments have been done on mice on control and nicotinamide-rich diet (mice were a week on nicotinamide-rich diet) as well as on transgenic mice overexpressing SUR2A (SUR2A mice), a regulatory subunit of cardioprotective ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels and their littermate controls (WT). The levels of mRNA in heart tissue were measured by real-time RT-PCR, whole heart and single cell resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion and severe hypoxia was measured by TTC staining and laser confocal microscopy, respectively. Nicotinamide-rich diet significantly decreased the size of myocardial infarction induced by ischaemia-reperfusion (from 42.5+/-4.6% of the area at risk zone in mice on control diet to 26.8+/-1.8% in mice on nicotinamide-rich diet, n=6-12, P=0.031). The cardioprotective effect of nicotinamide-rich diet was associated with 11.46+/-1.22 times (n=6) increased mRNA levels of SUR2A in the heart. HMR1098, a selective inhibitor of the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels opening, abolished cardioprotection afforded by nicotinamide-rich diet. Transgenic mice with a sole increase in SUR2A expression had also increased cardiac resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion. We conclude that nicotinamide-rich diet up-regulate SUR2A and increases heart resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion.","Pharmacological research","20083200",2010,"United Kingdom"
"Vitamin C prevents DNA damage induced by renovascular hypertension in multiple organs of Wistar rats.","The aim of this study was to investigate, through the single-cell gel (comet) assay, whether vitamin C is able to protect against renovascular hypertension-induced genotoxicity in multiple organs. A total of 32 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: negative control (n = 6); animals treated with vitamin C (n = 6); hypertensive rats (n = 10) and hypertensive rats and treated with vitamin C (n = 10). Hypertension was induced as a result of partial obstruction of the left renal artery by means of a silver clip during 6 weeks. Vitamin C was administered at 150 mg/kg during 7 consecutive days before the end of the experimental period. The results showed that vitamin C was able to protect blood cells against hypertension-induced genotoxicity. Brain, liver and heart cells were also protected by vitamin C following hypertension-induced genotoxic damage. Regarding blood pressure, vitamin C reduced the hypertensive state. In conclusion, our results suggest that vitamin C can prevent hypertension-induced DNA damage in blood, liver, brain and heart cells as well as to normalize the blood pressure of rats.","Human &amp; experimental toxicology","20053703",2010,"England"
"Effects of elevated Homocysteine hormone on electrical activity in the human atrium: A simulation study.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) accounts for a large proportion of healthcare expenditure world wide. Mechanisms underlying the genesis and maintenance of AF are still poorly understood. Though AF is largely thought to be caused and perpetuated by dysfunctions of cellular ion channels, disrupted intercellular gap junctional electrical coupling, and/or structural changes in the atria, it is also associated with abnormal secretion of hormones, such as a high level of Homocysteine (Hcy). It was found that a high concentration Hcy induces electrical remodeling of ion channels in human atrial cells that include the ultra rapid potassium, inward rectifier potassium and transient outward potassium currents. Such Hcy-induced ion channel remodeling in repolarising potassium currents has been hypothesized to be pro-arrhythmic. In this study, we carried out multi-scale simulations to evaluate the effects of Hcy-induced changes in potassium currents on the electrical activity of human atrium at single cell, 1D strand of tissue, and 3D anatomical models. We found that high Hcy concentration produced marked changes in atrial action potentials, including a more hyperpolarized resting potential, elevated plateau potential during early stages of repolarization and abbreviated action potential duration (APD). Losses in rate dependent accommodation of APD and effective refractory period were observed. In the tissue models, high Hcy concentration slowed down atrial excitation conduction at low rates, but facilitated it at high rates. Simulated re-entrant scroll waves in the 3D model self-terminated under Control condition, but sustained under high Hcy condition. These results collectively demonstrate the pro-arrhythmic effects of a high level Hcy in promoting and sustaining AF.","Conference proceedings : ...

"Evaluation of cardiac oxygen consumption under hypoxia with tissue model integrating microcirculation model and cell model.","Analyzing the microscopic energy balance of cardiac tissue is very important for understanding heart diseases. However, such analysis is difficult with animal experiments. Therefore, the accurate simulation model is expected to be an important tool for such research. We propose a cardiac tissue model which can reproduce accurate distribution of oxygen consumption under hypoxia. The model includes blood tissue exchange model of capillary and oxygen consumption model of cells. The capillary model is based on the model proposed by Dash et al. 2006, and the cell model is based on the model proposed by Kuzumoto et al. 2007. By analyzing the oxygen consumption of the proposed model, the relation between the oxygen consumption and the arterial oxygen concentration was found to be largely different from that of single cell model. This implies that the animal experimental data should be carefully used for constructing a biological simulation model, depending on whether the experiment is performed within a cell or a tissue.","Conference proceedings : ...

"Are endogenous sex hormones related to DNA damage in paradoxically sleep-deprived female rats?","The aim of this investigation was to evaluate overall DNA damage induced by experimental paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) in estrous-cycling and ovariectomized female rats to examine possible hormonal involvement during DNA damage. Intact rats in different phases of the estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, and diestrus) or ovariectomized female Wistar rats were subjected to PSD by the single platform technique for 96 h or were maintained for the equivalent period as controls in home-cages. After this period, peripheral blood and tissues (brain, liver, and heart) were collected to evaluate genetic damage using the single cell gel (comet) assay. The results showed that PSD caused extensive genotoxic effects in brain cells, as evident by increased DNA migration rates in rats exposed to PSD for 96 h when compared to negative control. This was observed for all phases of the estrous cycle indistinctly. In ovariectomized rats, PSD also led to DNA damage in brain cells. No significant statistically differences were detected in peripheral blood, the liver or heart for all groups analyzed. In conclusion, our data are consistent with the notion that genetic damage in the form of DNA breakage in brain cells induced by sleep deprivation overrides the effects related to endogenous female sex hormones.","Hormones and behavior","19958772",2009,"United States"
"A new direction for cardiac regeneration therapy: application of synergistically acting epicardium-derived cells and cardiomyocyte progenitor cells.","BACKGROUND: Adult human epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs), transplanted into the infarcted heart, are known to improve cardiac function, mainly through paracrine protection of the surrounding tissue. We hypothesized that this effect might be further improved if these supportive EPDCs were combined with cells that could possibly supply the ischemic heart with new cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we transplanted EPDCs together with cardiomyocyte progenitor cells that can generate mature cardiomyocytes in vitro.METHODS AND RESULTS: EPDCs and cardiomyocyte progenitor cells were isolated from human adult atrial appendages, expanded in culture, and transplanted separately or together into the infarcted mouse myocardium (total cell number, 4x10(5)). Cardiac function was determined 6 weeks later (9.4T MRI). Coculturing increased proliferation rate and production of several growth factors, indicating a mutual effect. Cotransplantation resulted in further improvement of cardiac function compared with single cell-type recipients (P&lt;0.05), which themselves demonstrated better function than vehicle-injected controls (P&lt;0.05). However, in contrast to our hypothesis, no graft-derived cardiomyocytes were observed within the 6-week survival, supporting that not only EPDCs but also cardiomyocyte progenitor cells acted in a paracrine manner. Because injected cell number and degree of engraftment were similar between groups, the additional functional improvement in the cotransplantation group cannot be explained by an increased amount of secreted factors but rather by an altered type of secretion.CONCLUSIONS: EPDCs and cardiomyocyte progenitor cells synergistically improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction, probably instigated by complementary paracrine actions. Our results demonstrate for the first time that synergistically acting cells hold great promise for future clinical regeneration therapy.","Circulation. Heart failure","19919990",2009,"United States"
"Cardiac and electrophysiological effects of primary and refined extracts from Leonurus cardiaca L. (Ph.Eur.).","Although several antiarrhythmic drugs of chemical origin are in clinical use since decades, their application is often limited by their adverse effects and especially by their inherited proarrhythmic risk, which can lead to a significantly increased mortality in patients receiving these compounds. On the other hand, aqueous extracts from the aerial parts of the European Lamiaceae Leonurus cardiaca (Ph.Eur.) have been used for centuries as a remedy against tachyarrhythmia and other cardiac disorders. Nevertheless, a scientific basis for the claim of direct cardiac electrophysiological, antiarrhythmic, or functional effects of Leonurus cardiacae herba (LCH) preparations has not been established until now. In order to enrich the active constituents from the primary extract which was tested as the most cardioactive, namely the aqueous Soxhlet extract, and to eliminate undesired substances such as the dichloromethanic fraction or potassium, a bioassay guided fractionation procedure was applied, resulting in the development of a Leonurus cardiaca refined extract (LCRE) which was characterised together with Leonurus crude extracts by a newly developed gradient elution HPLC fingerprint analysis for separation and quantification of six major phenolics as well as by qNMR for determining the stachydrine content. This refined extract was applied intracoronarily in isolated rabbit hearts perfused according to the Langendorff technique. Mapping experiments with 256 electrodes on the heart surface showed a reduction of left ventricular pressure and an increase of relative coronary flow at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/mL LCRE. Furthermore, the PQ-interval was prolonged and both the basic cycle length and the activation recovery interval increased. In addition, voltage-clamp measurements were performed on the following cell models in order to characterise the electrophysiological profile of LCRE: neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to investigate the effect on I(Na) and I(Ca.L), sinoatrial node cells and ventricular myocytes isolated from adult guinea pigs to test effects on I(f) and action potential (AP) duration, as well as HERG-transfected HEK 293 cells to analyse the influence on the I (K.r). In these voltage clamp experiments LCRE exerted a calcium-antagonistic activity by I(Ca.L) blockade, reduced the repolarising current I(K.r), and prolonged the AP-duration, while I(Na) was not affected. Although LCRE displayed only weak effects on the I(f) amplitude and voltage dependence, it significantly prolonged the activation time constant of I(f). Thus, LCRE acts on multiple electrophysiological targets, specifically I(Ca.L), I(K.r), and I(f), observed both at whole organ and single cell level.","Planta medica","19918711",2009,"Germany"
"Impaired Ca(2+)-handling in HIF-1alpha(+/-) mice as a consequence of pressure overload.","The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is critically involved in the cellular adaptation to a decrease in oxygen availability. The influence of HIF-1alpha for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac function that occurs in response to sustained pressure overload has been mainly attributed to a challenged cardiac angiogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy up to now. Hif-1alpha (+/+) and Hif-1alpha (+/-) mice were studied regarding left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac function after being subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). After TAC, both Hif-1alpha (+/+) and Hif-1alpha (+/-) mice developed left ventricular hypertrophy with increased posterior wall thickness, septum thickness and increased left ventricular weight to a similar extent. No significant difference in cardiac vessel density was observed between Hif-1alpha (+/+) and Hif-1alpha (+/-) mice. However, only the Hif-1alpha (+/-) mice developed severe heart failure as revealed by a significantly reduced fractional shortening mostly due to increased end-systolic left ventricular diameter. On the single cell level this correlated with reduced myocyte shortenings, decreased intracellular Ca(2+)-transients and SR-Ca(2+) content in myocytes of Hif-1a (+/-) mice. Thus, HIF-1alpha can be critically involved in the preservation of cardiac function after chronic pressure overload without affecting cardiac hypertrophy. This effect is mediated via HIF-dependent modulation of cardiac calcium handling and contractility.","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","19898976",2009,"Germany"
"Visualizing sodium dynamics in isolated cardiomyocytes using fluorescent nanosensors.","Regulation of sodium flux across the cell membrane plays a vital role in the generation of action potentials and regulation of membrane excitability in cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons. Alteration of sodium channel function has been implicated in diseases such as epilepsy, long QT syndrome, and heart failure. However, single cell imaging of sodium dynamics has been limited due to the narrow selection of fluorescent sodium indicators available to researchers. Here we report, the detection of spatially defined sodium activity during action potentials. Fluorescent nanosensors that measure sodium in real-time, are reversible and are completely selective over other cations such as potassium that were used to image sodium. The use of the nanosensors in vitro was validated by determining drug-induced activation in heterologous cells transfected with the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.7. Spatial information of sodium concentrations during action potentials will provide insight at the cellular level on the role of sodium and how slight changes in sodium channel function can affect the entirety of an action potential.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","19805271",2009,"United States"
"Local wound p38 MAPK inhibition attenuates burn-induced cardiac dysfunction.","BACKGROUND: Topical inhibition of activated p38 MAPK within burn wounds attenuates the local and systemic inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the effects of local activated p38 MAPK inhibition on burn-induced cardiac dysfunction.METHODS: Using a standardized rat model of scald burn injury, rats were given a 30% total body surface area partial thickness burn or sham injury, and the wounds were treated with an activated p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB) or vehicle. Systemic blood pressure measurements were recorded in vivo followed by in vitro assessment of sarcomere contraction in single-cell suspensions of isolated cardiomyocytes.RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure or maximum left ventricular pressures in vivo and peak cardiomyocyte sarcomere contractility in vitro were significantly reduced after burn injury. These functional deficits were abolished 24 h after burn injury following local p38 MAPK inhibition. In vitro incubation of normal cardiomyocytes with homogenate from burned skin or burn serum resulted in a similar pattern of impaired cardiomyocyte contractility. These effects were reversed in normal cardiomyocytes exposed to burn skin homogenates treated topically with a p38 MAPK inhibitor. A Western blot analysis showed that cardiac p38 MAPK activation was not affected by dermal blockade of activated p38 MAPK, arguing against systemic absorption of the inhibitor and indicating the involvement of systemic cytokine signaling.CONCLUSION: Topical activated p38 MAPK inhibition within burned skin attenuates the release of proinflammatory mediators and prevents burn-induced cardiac dysfunction after thermal injury. These results support the inhibition of burn-wound inflammatory signaling as a new therapeutic approach to prevent potential postthermal injury multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.","Surgery","19789038",2009,"United States"
"Cryo-Imaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Single Cells in a Mouse.","We developed a cryo-imaging system to provide single-cell detection of fluorescently labeled cells in mouse, with particular applicability to stem cells and metastatic cancer. The Case cryo-imaging system consists of a fluorescence microscope, robotic imaging positioner, customized cryostat, PC-based control system, and visualization/analysis software. The system alternates between sectioning (10-40 ¦Ìm) and imaging, collecting color brightfield and fluorescent block-face image volumes &gt;60GB. In mouse experiments, we imaged quantum-dot labeled stem cells, GFP-labeled cancer and stem cells, and cell-size fluorescent microspheres. To remove subsurface fluorescence, we used a simplified model of light-tissue interaction whereby the next image was scaled, blurred, and subtracted from the current image. We estimated scaling and blurring parameters by minimizing entropy of subtracted images. Tissue specific attenuation parameters were found [u(T) : heart (267 ¡À 47.6 ¦Ìm), liver (218 ¡À 27.1 ¦Ìm), brain (161 ¡À 27.4 ¦Ìm)] to be within the range of estimates in the literature. &quot;Next image&quot; processing removed subsurface fluorescence equally well across multiple tissues (brain, kidney, liver, adipose tissue, etc.), and analysis of 200 microsphere images in the brain gave 97¡À2% reduction of subsurface fluorescence. Fluorescent signals were determined to arise from single cells based upon geometric and integrated intensity measurements. Next image processing greatly improved axial resolution, enabled high quality 3D volume renderings, and improved enumeration of single cells with connected component analysis by up to 24%. Analysis of image volumes identified metastatic cancer sites, found homing of stem cells to injury sites, and showed microsphere distribution correlated with blood flow patterns.We developed and evaluated cryo-imaging to provide single-cell detection of fluorescently labeled cells in mouse. Our cryo-imaging system provides extreme (&gt;60GB), micron-scale, fluorescence, and bright field image data. Here we describe our image pre-processing, analysis, and visualization techniques. Processing improves axial resolution, reduces subsurface fluorescence by 97%, and enables single cell detection and counting. High quality 3D volume renderings enable us to evaluate cell distribution patterns. Applications include the myriad of biomedical experiments using fluorescent reporter gene and exogenous fluorophore labeling of cells in applications such as stem cell regenerative medicine, cancer, tissue engineering, etc.","Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering","19756213",2009,"United States"
"Macrophage heterogeneity in atherosclerotic plaques.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The varied behaviour of macrophages and foam cells during atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae prompt the question whether all these activities can be the property of a single cell population.RECENT FINDINGS: Subsets of monocytes with distinct patterns of surface markers and behaviours during inflammation have recently been characterized and shown to have complementary roles during progression of atherosclerosis. A variety of macrophage phenotypes derived from these monocyte subsets in response to mediators of innate and acquired immunity have also been found in plaques. Based on functional properties and genomic signatures, they may have different impacts on facets of plaque development, including fibrous cap and lipid core formation.SUMMARY: Monocyte and macrophage phenotypic diversity is important in atherogenesis. More work is needed to define consistent marker sets for the different foam cell phenotypes in experimental animals and humans. Cell tracking studies are needed to establish their relationship with monocyte subtypes. In addition, genetic and pharmacological manipulation of phenotypes will be useful to define their functions and exploit the resulting therapeutic potential.","Current opinion in lipidology","19741337",2009,"United Kingdom"
"How structure, Ca signals, and cellular communications underlie function in precapillary arterioles.","RATIONALE: Precapillary arterioles control blood flow to tissues and their correct function is vital. However, their small size has limited study and little is known concerning the calcium signals in their endothelial and muscle cells and how these relate to function.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether these small vessels are specialized in terms of structure and calcium signaling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using in situ confocal imaging we have studied the ultrastructure, Ca signaling and coordination of contraction in precapillary arterioles in ureter and vas deferens. We have compared the data to that from a small mesenteric artery. In the precapillary arteriole, 1 myocyte covers a approximately 10-microm length, and contraction of this single cell can decrease the diameter of this segment. In the mesenteric artery, more than 20 myocytes are required for this. In the precapillary arteriole, Ca signals arise solely from Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca release and not via ryanodine receptors. Agonist-induced Ca signals do not require Ca entry into the cell, do not spread or synchronize with neighboring cells, and are unaffected by endothelial stimulation, thereby allowing local control. This contrasts with the mesenteric artery, where Ca entry and ryanodine receptors are important and stimulation of the endothelium inhibits myocyte Ca signals and contraction.CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal the structural and signaling specializations underlying how blood flow is locally regulated, provide new insight into control of microcirculation, and provide a framework to explain its vulnerability to disease.","Circulation research","19713534",2009,"United Kingdom"
"Correlations in ion channel mRNA in rhythmically active neurons.","BACKGROUND: To what extent do identified neurons from different animals vary in their expression of ion channel genes? In neurons of the same type, is ion channel expression highly variable and/or is there any relationship between ion channel expression that is conserved?PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address these questions we measured ion channel mRNA in large cells (LCs) of the crab cardiac ganglion. We cloned a calcium channel, caco, and a potassium channel, shaker. Using single-cell quantitative PCR, we measured levels of mRNA for these and 6 other different ion channels in cardiac ganglion LCs. Across the population of LCs we measured 3-9 fold ranges of mRNA levels, and we found correlations in the expression of many pairs of conductancesSIGNIFICANCE: In previous measurements from the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), ion channel expression was variable, but many pairs of channels had correlated expression. However, each STG cell type had a unique combination of ion channel correlations. Our findings from the crab cardiac ganglion are similar, but the correlations in the LCs are different from those in STG neurons, supporting the idea that such correlations could be markers of cell identity or activity.","PloS one","19707591",2009,"United States"
"Comprehensive evaluation of Streptococcus sanguinis cell wall-anchored proteins in early infective endocarditis.","Streptococcus sanguinis is a member of the viridans group of streptococci and a leading cause of the life-threatening endovascular disease infective endocarditis. Initial contact with the cardiac infection site is likely mediated by S. sanguinis surface proteins. In an attempt to identify the proteins required for this crucial step in pathogenesis, we searched for surface-exposed, cell wall-anchored proteins encoded by S. sanguinis and then used a targeted signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) approach to evaluate their contributions to virulence. Thirty-three predicted cell wall-anchored proteins were identified-a number much larger than those found in related species. The requirement of each cell wall-anchored protein for infective endocarditis was assessed in the rabbit model. It was found that no single cell wall-anchored protein was essential for the development of early infective endocarditis. STM screening was also employed for the evaluation of three predicted sortase transpeptidase enzymes, which mediate the cell surface presentation of cell wall-anchored proteins. The sortase A mutant exhibited a modest (approximately 2-fold) reduction in competitiveness, while the other two sortase mutants were indistinguishable from the parental strain. The combined results suggest that while cell wall-anchored proteins may play a role in S. sanguinis infective endocarditis, strategies designed to interfere with individual cell wall-anchored proteins or sortases would not be effective for disease prevention.","Infection and immunity","19703977",2009,"United States"
"Endothelial progenitor cells as a sole source for ex vivo seeding of tissue-engineered heart valves.","PURPOSES: We investigated whether circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can be used as a cell source for the creation of a tissue-engineered heart valve (TEHV).METHODS: Trileaflet valved conduits were fabricated using nonwoven polyglycolic acid/poly-4-hydroxybutyrate polymer. Ovine peripheral blood EPCs were dynamically seeded onto a valved conduit and incubated for 7, 14, and 21 days.RESULTS: Before seeding, EPCs were shown to express CD31(+), eNOS(+), and VE-Cadherin(+) but not alpha-smooth muscle actin. Histological analysis demonstrated relatively homogenous cellular ingrowth throughout the valved conduit. TEHV constructs revealed the presence of endothelial cell (EC) markers and alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) cells comparable with native valves. Protein levels were comparable with native valves and exceeded those in unseeded controls. EPC-TEHV demonstrated a temporal pattern of matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 expression and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase activities comparable to that of native valves. Mechanical properties of EPC-TEHV demonstrated significantly greater stiffness than that of the unseeded scaffolds and native valves.CONCLUSIONS: Circulating EPC appears to have the potential to provide both interstitial and endothelial functions and could potentially serve as a single-cell source for construction of autologous heart valves.","Tissue engineering.

"Engineering proteins for custom inhibition of Ca(V) channels.","The influx of Ca(2+) ions through voltage-dependent calcium (Ca(V)) channels links electrical signals to physiological responses in all excitable cells. Not surprisingly, blocking Ca(V) channel activity is a powerful method to regulate the function of excitable cells, and this is exploited for both physiological and therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, the full potential for Ca(V) channel inhibition is not being realized by currently available small-molecule blockers or second-messenger modulators due to limitations in targeting them either to defined groups of cells in an organism or to distinct subcellular regions within a single cell. Here, we review early efforts to engineer protein molecule blockers of Ca(V) channels to fill this crucial niche. This technology would greatly expand the toolbox available to physiologists studying the biology of excitable cells at the cellular and systems level.","Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)","19675352",2009,"United States"
"Comparative gene expression analysis and fate mapping studies suggest an early segregation of cardiogenic lineages in Xenopus laevis.","Retrospective clonal analysis in mice suggested that the vertebrate heart develops from two sources of cells called first and second lineages, respectively. Cells of the first lineage enter the linear heart tube and initiate terminal differentiation earlier than cells of the second lineage. It is thought that both heart lineages arise from a common progenitor cell population prior to the cardiac crescent stage (E7.5 of mouse development). The timing of segregation of different lineages as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this process is not yet known. Furthermore, gene expression data for those lineages are very limited. Here we provide the first comparative study of cardiac marker gene expression during Xenopus laevis embryogenesis complemented by single cell RT-PCR analysis. In addition we provide fate mapping data of cardiac progenitor cells at different stages of development. Our analysis indicates an early segregation of cardiac lineages and a fairly complex heterogeneity of gene expression in the cardiac progenitor cells. Furthermore, this study sets a reference for all further studies analyzing cardiac development in X. laevis.","Developmental biology","19660447",2009,"United States"
"Clonal differentiation of skeletal muscle-derived CD34(-)/45(-) stem cells into cardiomyocytes in vivo.","The differentiation and/or therapeutic potential of skeletal muscle-derived stem cells for cardiac infarction have been studied extensively for use in cellular cardiomyoplasty, as injured cardiomyocytes exhibit limited regenerative capacity. We previously reported cardio-myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle-derived CD34+/45(-) (Sk-34) stem cells after therapeutic transplantation. However, the clonal differentiation potential of these cells remains unknown. Here, we show that skeletal muscle-derived CD34(-)/45(-) (Sk-DN) stem cells, which are situated upstream of Sk-34 cells in the same lineage, exhibit clonal differentiation into cardiomyocytes after single cell-derived single-sphere implantation into myocardium. Sk-DN cells were enzymatically isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice and purified by flow cytometry, and were then clonally cultured in collagen-based medium with bFGF and EGF after clonal cell sorting. Single cell-derived single-sphere colonies of Sk-DN cells were directly implanted into the wild-type mouse myocardium. At 4 weeks after implantation, donor cells exhibited typical cardiomyocyte structure with the formation of gap-junctions between donor and recipient cells. Expression of specific mRNAs for cardiomyocytes, such as cardiac actin and GATA-4, Nkx2-5, Isl-1, Mef2, and Hand2, were also seen in clonal cell cultures of Sk-DN cells. Cell fusion-independent differentiation was also confirmed by bulk cell transplantation using Cre- and loxP (enhanced GFP)-mice. We conclude that Sk-DN cells can give rise to cardiac muscle cells clonally, and that skeletal muscle includes a practical cell source for cellular cardiomyoplasty.","Stem cells and development","19634996",2009,"United States"
"Purification of cardiac myocytes from human heart biopsies for gene expression analysis.","The collection of gene expression data from human heart biopsies is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of arrhythmias and diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Many clinical and basic research laboratories conduct gene expression analysis using RNA from whole cardiac biopsies. This allows for the analysis of global changes in gene expression in areas of the heart, while eliminating the need for more complex and technically difficult single-cell isolation procedures (such as flow cytometry, laser capture microdissection, etc.) that require expensive equipment and specialized training. The abundance of fibroblasts and other cell types in whole biopsies, however, can complicate gene expression analysis and the interpretation of results. Therefore, we have designed a technique to quickly and easily purify cardiac myocytes from whole cardiac biopsies for RNA extraction. Human heart tissue samples were collected, and our purification method was compared with the standard nonpurification method. Cell imaging using acridine orange staining of the purified sample demonstrated that &gt;98% of total RNA was contained within identifiable cardiac myocytes. Real-time RT-PCR was performed comparing nonpurified and purified samples for the expression of troponin T (myocyte marker), vimentin (fibroblast marker), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (smooth muscle marker). Troponin T expression was significantly increased, and vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were significantly decreased in the purified sample (n = 8; P &lt; 0.05). Extracted RNA was analyzed during each step of the purification, and no significant degradation occurred. These results demonstrate that this isolation method yields a more purified cardiac myocyte RNA sample suitable for downstream applications, such as real-time RT-PCR, and allows for more accurate gene expression changes in cardiac myocytes from heart biopsies.","American journal of physiology.

"DNA damage in response to an Ironman triathlon.","The major aims of this study were to investigate the effect of an Ironman triathlon on DNA migration in the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, apoptosis and necrosis in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay with lymphocytes and on changes of total antioxidant capacity in plasma.

"Characterization of long-term cultured c-kit+ cardiac stem cells derived from adult rat hearts.","Previous studies have revealed c-kit-positive (c-kit(+)) cardiac stem cells (CSCs) in the adult mammalian heart and these cells could be a suitable cell source for heart regeneration therapy. However, these cells have not been fully evaluated in terms of characterization and effect of long-term culture, which is necessary for their safe and optimal usage. Therefore, we isolated c-kit(+) CSCs from adult rat hearts to characterize these cells and investigate stability over long-term culture. We performed isolations of c-kit(+) CSCs 11 times and passaged them 40 times in a bulk culture system; we termed these cultures, bulk culture CSCs (CSC-BC). c-kit(+) CSCs expressed stemness genes and exhibited stem cell properties of single cell-derived clone formation, cardiosphere generation, and potential to differentiate into the three main cardiac lineages: cardiomyocyte, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells in vitro. Over long-term culture, some CSC-BC up-regulated GATA-4 expression, which resulted in enhanced cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting that the GATA-4 high c-kit(+) CSCs have potent cardiac regenerative potential. We also observed the spontaneous differentiation into cells other than cardiac lineages, such as adipocyte and skeletal myocyte. This effect of long-term culture on the c-kit(+) CSCs has not been previously reported. Interestingly, when c-kit(+) CSCs were co-cultured with adult rat cardiomyocytes, we found increased cardiomyocyte survival, and the growth factors, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), appeared to be responsible factors. The present study suggests that c-kit(+) CSCs have great therapeutic potential yet should be further investigated and optimized as a cell source for regenerative therapies prior to transplantation.","Stem cells and development","19580375",2009,"United States"
"[The interactions between the circadian clock and aging].","It is well known that almost all organisms ranging from single cell creatures to human beings exhibit circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior under the control of the internal circadian clock. The internal circadian clock is composed of a master clock which is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the peripheral clocks located in peripheral tissues such as the liver and heart. Along with aging, the circadian rhythm alters in many aspects, including the amplitude, free-running period and the expression phase. On the other hand, the circadian clock also influences the process of aging. The disorganized circadian rhythm accelerates the aging process. This article briefly reviews the recent progress in the interactions between the circadian clock and aging, and provides evidence to further understand the mechanism of aging and the impact of aging on the organisms.","Sheng li ke xue jin zhan [Progress in physiology]","19558140",2009,"China"
"Simultaneous live cell imaging using dual FRET sensors with a single excitation light.","Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins is a powerful tool for visualization of signal transduction in living cells, and recently, some strategies for imaging of dual FRET pairs in a single cell have been reported. However, these necessitate alteration of excitation light between two different wavelengths to avoid the spectral overlap, resulting in sequential detection with a lag time. Thus, to follow fast signal dynamics or signal changes in highly motile cells, a single-excitation dual-FRET method should be required. Here we reported this by using four-color imaging with a single excitation light and subsequent linear unmixing to distinguish fluorescent proteins. We constructed new FRET sensors with Sapphire/RFP to combine with CFP/YFP, and accomplished simultaneous imaging of cAMP and cGMP in single cells. We confirmed that signal amplitude of our dual FRET measurement is comparable to of conventional single FRET measurement. Finally, we demonstrated to monitor both intracellular Ca(2+) and cAMP in highly motile cardiac myocytes. To cancel out artifacts caused by the movement of the cell, this method expands the applicability of the combined use of dual FRET sensors for cell samples with high motility.","PloS one","19551140",2009,"United States"
"Removal of out-of-plane fluorescence for single cell visualization and quantification in cryo-imaging.","We developed a cryo-imaging system, which alternates between sectioning (10-40 microm) and imaging bright field and fluorescence block-face image volumes with micron-scale-resolution. For applications requiring single-cell detection of fluorescently labeled cells anywhere in a mouse, we are developing software for reduction of out-of-plane fluorescence. In mouse experiments, we imaged GFP-labeled cancer and stem cells, and cell-sized fluorescent microspheres. To remove out-of-plane fluorescence, we used a simplified model of light-tissue interaction whereby the next-image was scaled, blurred, and subtracted from the current image. We estimated scaling and blurring parameters by minimizing an objective function on subtracted images. Tissue-specific attenuation parameters [micro(T): heart (267 +/- 47.6 cm(-1)), liver (218 +/- 27.1 cm(-1)), brain (161 +/- 27.4 cm(-1))] were found to be within the range of estimates in the literature. &quot;Next-image&quot; processing removed out-of-plane fluorescence equally well across multiple tissues (brain, kidney, liver, etc.), and analysis of 200 microsphere images gave 97 +/- 2% reduction of out-of-plane fluorescence. Next-image processing greatly improved axial-resolution, enabled high quality 3D volume renderings, and improved automated enumeration of single cells by up to 24%.

"Regulation of Ca2+ signaling with particular focus on mast cells.","Calcium signals mediate diverse cellular functions in immunological cells. Early studies with mast cells, then a preeminent model for studying Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, revealed several basic features of calcium signaling in non-electrically excitable cells. Subsequent studies in these and other cells further defined the basic processes such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); coupling of ER store depletion to influx of external Ca2+ through a calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channel now attributed to the interaction of the ER Ca2+ sensor, stromal interacting molecule-1 (STIM1), with a unique Ca2+-channel protein, Orai1/CRACM1, and subsequent uptake of excess Ca2+ into ER and mitochondria through ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps. In addition, transient receptor potential channels and ion exchangers also contribute to the generation of calcium signals that may be global or have dynamic (e.g., waves and oscillations) and spatial resolution for specific functional readouts. This review discusses past and recent developments in this field of research, the pharmacologic agents that have assisted in these endeavors, and the mast cell as an exemplar for sorting out how calcium signals may regulate multiple outputs in a single cell.","Critical reviews in immunology","19496745",2009,"United States"
"Instability in action potential morphology underlies phase 2 reentry: a mathematical modeling study.","BACKGROUND: Phase 2 reentry occurs when electrotonic current propagates from sites of normal notch-and-dome action potentials (APs) to loss-of-dome abbreviated AP sites, causing abnormal reexcitation. The existence of two neighboring regions exhibiting these two different AP morphologies is believed to be sufficient for local reexcitation and development of phase 2 reentry.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of phase 2 reentry development in simulated tissues having no gradient or continuous gradients of ionic currents that affect phase 2. In particular, we investigated gradients of the transient outward current conductance G(to), representing hypothesized right ventricular G(to) gradients.METHODS: Single-cell simulations of Luo-Rudy dynamic model cells with a range of G(to) values were performed. In addition, one-dimensional fiber simulations were used to investigate the spatiotemporal phenomenon of phase 2 reentry.RESULTS: In single-cell simulations, low and normal values of G(to) produced the notch-and-dome morphology, whereas high values of G(to) produced abbreviated APs with loss-of-dome morphology. However, intermediate values of G(to) caused cells to switch intermittently between the two morphologies during constant pacing. Phase 2 reentry occurred in homogeneous and heterogeneous cable simulations, but only when a mass of cells had G(to) values close to the unstable &quot;switching&quot; behavior range.CONCLUSION: A main factor underlying phase 2 reentry apparently is not the presence of two different stable morphologies in adjacent regions but rather unstable switching AP morphology within a significant subset of cells.","Heart rhythm","19467510",2009,"United States"
"Calmodulin kinase II initiates arrhythmogenicity during metabolic acidification in murine hearts.","AIM: The multifunctional signal molecule calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) has been associated with cardiac arrhythmogenesis under conditions where its activity is chronically elevated. Recent studies report that its activity is also acutely elevated during acidosis. We test a hypothesis implicating CaMKII in the arrhythmogenesis accompanying metabolic acidification.METHODS: We obtained monophasic action potential recordings from Langendorff-perfused whole heart preparations and single cell action potentials (AP) using whole-cell patch-clamped ventricular myocytes. Spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) Ca(2+)release events during metabolic acidification were investigated using confocal microscope imaging of Fluo-4-loaded ventricular myocytes.RESULTS: In Langendorff-perfused murine hearts, introduction of lactic acid into the Krebs-Henseleit perfusate resulted in abnormal electrical activity and ventricular tachycardia. The CaMKII inhibitor, KN-93 (2 microm), reversibly suppressed this spontaneous arrhythmogenesis during intrinsic rhythm and regular 8 Hz pacing. However, it failed to suppress arrhythmia evoked by programmed electrical stimulation. These findings paralleled a CaMKII-independent reduction in the transmural repolarization gradients during acidosis, which previously has been associated with the re-entrant substrate under other conditions. Similar acidification produced spontaneous AP firing and membrane potential oscillations in patch-clamped isolated ventricular myocytes when pipette solutions permitted cytosolic Ca(2+) to increase following acidification. However, these were abolished by both KN-93 and use of pipette solutions that held cytosolic Ca(2+) constant during acidosis. Acidosis also induced spontaneous Ca(2+) waves in isolated intact Fluo-4-loaded myocytes studied using confocal microscopy that were abolished by KN-93.CONCLUSION: These findings together implicate CaMKII-dependent SR Ca(2+) waves in spontaneous arrhythmic events during metabolic acidification.","Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)","19416122",2009,"United Kingdom"

"Distribution of the pacemaker HCN4 channel mRNA and protein in the rabbit sinoatrial node.","Several studies of the pacemaker mechanisms in mammalian cells, most of which were carried out in cells isolated from the rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN), have highlighted the role of the I(f) current. While the distribution of Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, the molecular correlates of f-channels, is known at the mRNA level, the identification of f-channel proteins in this tissue is still undetermined. Here we investigate HCN protein expression in the rabbit pacemaker region. We found that HCN4 is the main isoform, and set therefore to analyze its distribution within the SAN and surrounding areas with the aim of correlating protein expression and pacemaking function. The analysis was carried out in tissue slices and single cells of the intercaval area, which includes the crista terminalis (CT), the SAN, and the septum interatrialis (SI). Immunolabeling, in situ hybridization, qRT-PCR analysis, and electrophysiological recordings identified the SAN as a region characterized by high HCN4 signal and current levels, while the expression in the CT and in the SI was either negligible or absent. Detailed analysis of the central SAN area showed that cells are predominantly distributed in islets interconnected by cell prolongations, and single-cell HCN4 labeling suggested sites of channel clustering. Our data indicate that in the rabbit SAN, HCN4 proteins are major constituents of native f-channels, and their distribution matches closely the SAN as defined morphologically and electrophysiologically. Until recently, the SAN was identified as the region where Cx43 and atrial natriuretic peptide are not expressed; we propose here that expression of HCN4 is an appropriate tool to map and identify the cardiac SAN pacemaker region.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","19394343",2009,"England"
"Teratoma formation by human embryonic stem cells: evaluation of essential parameters for future safety studies.","Transplantation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into immune-deficient mice leads to the formation of differentiated tumors comprising all three germ layers, resembling spontaneous human teratomas. Teratoma assays are considered the gold standard for demonstrating differentiation potential of pluripotent hESC and hold promise as a standard for assessing safety among hESC-derived cell populations intended for therapeutic applications. We tested the potency of teratoma formation in seven anatomical transplantation locations (kidney capsule, muscle, subcutaneous space, peritoneal cavity, testis, liver, epididymal fat pad) in SCID mice with and without addition of Matrigel, and found that intramuscular teratoma formation was the most experimentally convenient, reproducible, and quantifiable. In the same experimental setting, we compared undifferentiated hESC and differentiated populations enriched for either beating cardiomyocytes or definitive endoderm derivatives (insulin-secreting beta cells), and showed that all cell preparations rapidly formed teratomas with varying percentages of mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm. In limiting dilution experiments, we found that as little as two hESC colonies spiked into feeder fibroblasts produced a teratoma, while a more rigorous single-cell titration achieved a detection limit of 1/4000. In summary, we established core parameters essential for facilitating safety profiling of hESC-derived products for future therapeutic applications.","Stem cell research","19393593",2009,"England"
"Lead-, cadmium-, and arsenic-induced DNA damage in rat germinal cells.","Toxic agents can interfere with the male reproductive system at many targets. One of the major unresolved questions concerning male infertility is identification of its molecular origins. Clinical and animal studies indicate that abnormalities of spermatogenesis result from exposure to three toxic metals (lead acetate, cadmium chloride, and arsenic trioxide), but the effects on primary spermatocyte DNA of the male rat after chronic exposure to these metals have not been identified. The aims of this study were to analyze, in three independent experiments, the DNA damage induced by lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) in rat germinal cells during three time periods, and to determine the relationship between DNA damage and blood Pb, blood Cd, and urine As levels. For lead acetate and cadmium chloride experiments, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, while for arsenic trioxide a 24-h urine sample was collected. Afterward, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Pachytene spermatocytes from rat testes were purified by trypsin digestion followed by centrifugal elutriation. After establishment of cell purity and viability, DNA damage (tail length) was measured employing a single cell gel/comet assay. Significant DNA damage was found in primary spermatocytes from rats with chronic exposure (13 weeks) to toxic metals. In conclusion, these findings indicate that exposure to toxic metals affects primary spermatocyte DNA and are suggestive of possible direct testicular toxicity.","DNA and cell biology","19388847",2009,"United States"
"A single-cell model of phase-driven control of ventricular fibrillation frequency.","The mechanisms controlling the rotation frequency of functional reentry in ventricular fibrillation (VF) are poorly understood. It has been previously shown that Ba2+ at concentrations up to 50 mumol/L slows the rotation frequency in the intact guinea pig (GP) heart, suggesting a role of the inward rectifier current (I(K1)) in the mechanism governing the VF response to Ba2+. Given that other biological (e.g., sinoatrial node) and artificial systems display phase-locking behavior, we hypothesized that the mechanism for controlling the rotation frequency of a rotor by I(K1) blockade is phase-driven, i.e., the phase shift between transmembrane current and voltage remains constant at varying levels of I(K1) blockade. We measured whole-cell admittance in isolated GP myocytes and in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing Kir 2.1 and 2.3 channels. The admittance phase, i.e., the phase difference between current and voltage, was plotted versus the frequency in control conditions and at 10 or 50 micromol/L Ba2+ (in GP heart cells) or 1 mM Ba2+ (in HEK cells). The horizontal distance between plots was called the &quot;frequency shift in a single cell&quot; and analyzed. The frequency shift in a single cell was -14.14 +/- 5.71 Hz (n = 14) at 10 microM Ba2+ and -18.51 +/- 4.00 Hz (n = 10) at 50 microM Ba2+, p &lt; 0.05. The values perfectly matched the Ba2+-induced reduction of VF frequency observed previously in GP heart. A similar relationship was found in the computer simulations. The phase of Ba2+-sensitive admittance in GP cells was -2.65 +/- 0.32 rad at 10 Hz and -2.79 +/- 0.26 rad at 30 Hz. In HEK cells, the phase of Ba2+-sensitive admittance was 3.09 +/- 0.03 rad at 10 Hz and 3.00 +/- 0.17 rad at 30 Hz. We have developed a biological single-cell model of rotation-frequency control. The results show that although rotation frequency changes as a result of I(K1) blockade, the phase difference between transmembrane current and transmembrane voltage remains constant, enabling us to quantitatively predict the change of VF frequency resulting from I(K1) blockade, based on single-cell measurement.","Biophysical journal","19348777",2009,"United States"
"Chronic renal failure induces genetic instability in multiple organs of Wistar rats.","BACKGROUND: Taking into consideration the strong evidence for a relationship between DNA damage and carcinogenesis, the aim of this study was to investigate whether blood, liver, heart, kidney and brain are particularly sensitive organs for DNA damaging during chronic renal disease by the single-cell gel (comet) assay to predict genetic instability induced by this pathological condition.METHODS: A total of 18 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: negative control (n = 8) and experimental (n = 10), in which was submitted to the 5/6 renal mass ablation by ligation of two or three branches of the left renal artery and total right nephrectomy during 8 weeks.RESULTS: The results showed that chronic renal disease was able to induce genetic damage in blood, heart, liver and kidney cells as depicted by the mean tail moment. No genetic damage was induced in brain cells, i.e. no significant statistically differences (P &gt; 0.05) were noticed when compared to negative control.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results suggest that chronic renal failure could contribute to the damage of DNA at all organs evaluated, except to the brain cells. As DNA damage is an important step in events leading to carcinogenesis, this study represents a relevant contribution to the correct evaluation of the potential health risks associated with kidney disease.","European journal of clinical investigation","19292884",2009,"England"
"Distinct effects of acute and chronic sleep loss on DNA damage in rats.","The aim of this investigation was to evaluate genetic damage induced in male rats by experimental sleep loss for short-term (24 and 96 h) and long-term (21 days) intervals, as well as their respective recovery periods in peripheral blood, brain, liver and heart tissue by the single cell gel (comet) assay. Rats were paradoxically deprived of sleep (PSD) by the platform technique for 24 or 96 h, or chronically sleep-restricted (SR) for 21 days. We also sought to verify the time course of their recovery after 24 h of rebound sleep. The results showed DNA damage in blood cells of rats submitted to PSD for 96 h. Brain tissue showed extensive genotoxic damage in PSD rats (both 24 and 96 h), though the effect was more pronounced in the 96 h group. Rats allowed to recover from the PSD-96 h and SR-21 days treatments showed DNA damage as compared to negative controls. Liver and heart did not display any genotoxicity activity. Corticosterone concentrations were increased after PSD (24 and 96 h) relative to control rats, whereas these levels were unaffected in the SR group. Collectively, these findings reveal that sleep loss was able to induce genetic damage in blood and brain cells, especially following acute exposure. Since DNA damage is an important step in events leading to genomic instability, this study represents a relevant contribution to the understanding of the potential health risks associated with sleep deprivation.","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology &amp; biological psychiatry","19258023",2009,"England"
"A possible neural basis for stress-induced hyperalgesia.","Intense stress and fear have long been known to give rise to a suppression of pain termed &quot;stress-induced analgesia&quot;, mediated by brainstem pain-modulating circuitry, including pain-inhibiting neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla. However, stress does not invariably suppress pain, and indeed, may exacerbate it. Although there is a growing support for the idea of &quot;stress-induced hyperalgesia&quot;, the neurobiological basis for this effect remains almost entirely unknown. Using simultaneous single-cell recording and functional analysis, we show here that stimulation of the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, known to be a critical component of central mechanisms mediating neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and thermogenic responses to mild or &quot;emotional&quot; stressors such as air puff, also triggers thermal hyperalgesia by recruiting pain-facilitating neurons, &quot;ON-cells&quot;, in the rostral ventromedial medulla. Activity of identified RVM ON-cells, OFF-cells and NEUTRAL cells, nociceptive withdrawal thresholds, rectal temperature, and heart rate were recorded in lightly anesthetized rats. In addition to the expected increases in body temperature and heart rate, disinhibition of the DMH induced a robust activation of ON-cells, suppression of OFF-cell firing and behavioral hyperalgesia. Blocking ON-cell activation prevented hyperalgesia, but did not interfere with DMH-induced thermogenesis or tachycardia, pointing to differentiation of neural substrates for autonomic and nociceptive modulation within the RVM. These data demonstrate a top-down activation of brainstem pain-facilitating neurons, and suggest a possible neural circuit for stress-induced hyperalgesia.","Pain","19232470",2009,"United States"
"Role of endogenous bone marrow cells in long-term repair mechanisms after myocardial infarction.","Homing and regenerative potential of endogenous bone marrow cells (BMC) in myocardial infarction (MI) is a controversial issue. Using human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPLAP) as genetic marker for cell tracking, we examined the influx of bone marrow-derived cells during tissue repair after the induction of MI over a study period of 17 weeks in wild-type inbred Fischer 344 rats, lethally irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from transgenic F344 rats expressing hPLAP under the control of the ubiquitous R26 promoter. During the early phases of tissue repair, hPLAP-positive macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and also myofibroblast-like cells were recruited from BM. However, only some hPLAP-positive endothelial cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblast-like cells persisted until 17 weeks after MI. With the exception of a single cell, there was no evidence of BM-derived cardiomyocytes throughout the study. Rather, some local cardiac progenitor cells appeared to differentiate into cardiomyocytes in the peri-infarct regions. In conclusion, our data show that the inflammation-induced influx of BM-derived cells into the infarction area is restricted to leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblast-like cells. Our long-term analysis casts doubt on the hypothesis that circulating BM-derived mesenchymal precursor cells participate in cardiomyogenesis after MI.","Journal of cellular and molecular medicine","19210759",2009,"England"
"c-kit expression identifies cardiovascular precursors in the neonatal heart.","Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells indicates that mesodermal lineages in the mammalian heart (cardiac, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells) develop from a common, multipotent cardiovascular precursor. To isolate and characterize the lineage potential of a resident pool of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPcs), we developed BAC transgenic mice in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is placed under control of the c-kit locus (c-kit(BAC)-EGFP mice). Discrete c-kit-EGFP(+) cells were observed at different stages of differentiation in embryonic hearts, increasing in number to a maximum at about postnatal day (PN) 2; thereafter, EGFP(+) cells declined and were rarely observed in the adult heart. EGFP(+) cells purified from PN 0-5 hearts were nestin(+) and expanded in culture; 67% of cells were fluorescent after 9 days. Purified cells differentiated into endothelial, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, and differentiation could be directed by specific growth factors. CPc-derived cardiac myocytes displayed rhythmic beating and action potentials characteristic of multiple cardiac cell types, similar to ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Single-cell dilution studies confirmed the potential of individual CPcs to form all 3 cardiovascular lineages. In adult hearts, cryoablation resulted in c-kit-EGFP(+) expression, peaking 7 days postcryolesion. Expression occurred in endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the revascularizing infarct, and in terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes in the border zone surrounding the infarct. Thus, c-kit expression marks CPc in the neonatal heart that are capable of directed differentiation in vitro; however, c-kit expression in cardiomyocytes in the adult heart after injury does not identify cardiac myogenesis.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","19193854",2009,"United States"
"Microelectronic system for high-resolution mapping of extracellular electric fields applied to brain slices.","There is an enduring quest for technologies that provide - temporally and spatially - highly resolved information on electric neuronal or cardiac activity in functional tissues or cell cultures. Here, we present a planar high-density, low-noise microelectrode system realized in microelectronics technology that features 11,011 microelectrodes (3,150 electrodes per mm(2)), 126 of which can be arbitrarily selected and can, via a reconfigurable routing scheme, be connected to on-chip recording and stimulation circuits. This device enables long-term extracellular electrical-activity recordings at subcellular spatial resolution and microsecond temporal resolution to capture the entire dynamics of the cellular electrical signals. To illustrate the device performance, extracellular potentials of Purkinje cells (PCs) in acute slices of the cerebellum have been analyzed. A detailed and comprehensive picture of the distribution and dynamics of action potentials (APs) in the somatic and dendritic regions of a single cell was obtained from the recordings by applying spike sorting and spike-triggered averaging methods to the collected data. An analysis of the measured local current densities revealed a reproducible sink/source pattern within a single cell during an AP. The experimental data substantiated compartmental models and can be used to extend those models to better understand extracellular single-cell potential patterns and their contributions to the population activity. The presented devices can be conveniently applied to a broad variety of biological preparations, i.e., neural or cardiac tissues, slices, or cell cultures can be grown or placed directly atop of the chips for fundamental mechanistic or pharmacological studies.","Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics","19157842",2009,"England"
"Mechanisms underlying the formation and dynamics of subcellular calcium alternans in the intact rat heart.","Optical mapping of intact cardiac tissue reveals that, in some cases, intracellular calcium (Ca) release can alternate from one beat to the next in a large-small-large sequence, also referred to as Ca transient (CaT) alternans. CaT alternans can also become spatially phase-mismatched within a single cell, when one part of the cell alternates in a large-small-large sequence, whereas a different part alternates in a small-large-small sequence, a phenomenon known as subcellular discordant alternans. The mechanisms for the formation and spatiotemporal evolution of these phase-mismatched patterns are not known. We used confocal Ca imaging to measure CaT alternans at the sarcomeric level within individual myocytes in the intact rat heart. After a sudden change in cycle length (CL), 2 distinct spatial patterns of CaT alternans emerge. CaTs can form spatially phase-mismatched alternans patterns after the first few beats following the change in CL. The phase mismatch persists for many beats, after which it gradually becomes phase matched via the movement of nodes, which are junctures between phase-mismatched cell regions. In other examples, phase-matched alternans gradually become phase-mismatched, via the formation and movement of nodes. In these examples, we observed large beat-to-beat variations in the cell activation times, despite constant CL pacing. Using computer simulations, we explored the underlying mechanisms for these dynamical phenomena. Our results show how heterogeneity at the sarcomeric level, in conjunction with the dynamics of Ca cycling and membrane voltage, can lead to complex spatiotemporal phenomena within myocytes of the intact heart.","Circulation research","19150887",2009,"United States"
"Adiponectin acts in the nucleus of the solitary tract to decrease blood pressure by modulating the excitability of neuropeptide Y neurons.","Adiponectin is an adipocyte derived hormone which acts in the CNS to control autonomic function, energy and cardiovascular homeostasis. Two 7-transmembrane domain receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, expressed in the hypothalamus and brainstem mediate the actions of adiponectin. The medulla's nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is the primary viscerosensory integration site and an important nucleus in the regulation of cardiovascular function. Here we show the localization of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA in the NTS. We have investigated the consequences of receptor activation in response to exogenous application of adiponectin on cardiovascular (blood pressure and heart rate monitoring in vivo), and single neuron (whole cell current-clamp recordings in vitro) function. Microinjection of adiponectin in the medial NTS (mNTS) at the level of the area postrema resulted in a decrease in BP (mean AUC= -2055+/-648.1, n=5, mean maximum effect: -11.7+/-3.6 mm Hg) while similar commissural NTS (cNTS) microinjections were without effect. Patch clamp recordings from NTS neurons in a medullary slice preparation showed rapid (within 200 s of application) reversible (usually within 1000 s following washout) effects of adiponectin on the membrane potential of 62% of mNTS neurons tested (38/61). In 34% (n=21) of mNTS neurons adiponectin induced a depolarization of membrane potential (6.8+/-0.9 mV), while the remainder of mNTS cells influenced by adiponectin (n=17) hyperpolarized in response to this adipokine (-5.4+/-0.7 mV). Post-hoc single cell RT-PCR (ssRT-PCR) analysis of neurons showed that the majority of NPY mRNA positive mNTS neurons were depolarized by adiponectin (7/11), while 4 of these depolarized cells were also GAD67 positive. The results presented in this study suggest adiponectin acts in the NTS to control BP and suggest that such effects may occur as a direct result of the ability of this adipokine to modulate the excitability of discrete groups of neurons in the NTS. These studies identify the mNTS as a new CNS site which adiponectin may act to influence central autonomic processing.","Brain research","19103175",2008,"Netherlands"
"Real-time observations of intracellular Mg2+ signaling and waves in a single living ventricular myocyte cell.","Despite the important regulatory role of Mg(2+) in metabolic pathways, its underlying mechanism is not completely understood at the single-cell level. This study examined the propagation and dynamics of Mg(2+) signaling across the cell membrane by employing the real-time visualization of intracellular Mg(2+) waves in living ventricular myocytes using a combination of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and Nomarski differential interference contrast. Real-time Mg(2+) waves and sparks in a living cell membrane were observed using a fluorescent Mg(2+) indicator (mag-fluo-4-AM) in the concentration range of 5 aM-5 muM. The intracellular locations of the fluorescent Mg(2+) indicator were confirmed by adding Na(+)ATP. The Mg(2+) sparks and waves showed random temporal propagation patterns in nonhomogeneous substructures. These results show that spatiotemporal intracellular Mg(2+) signaling information can be obtained for individual living cells.","Analytical chemistry","19086893",2008,"United States"
"Blood collection from the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus.","The horseshoe crab has the best-characterized immune system of any long-lived invertebrate. The study of immunity in horseshoe crabs has been facilitated by the ease in collecting large volumes of blood and from the simplicity of the blood. Horseshoe crabs show only a single cell type in the general circulation, the granular amebocyte. The plasma has the salt content of sea water and only three abundant proteins, hemocyanin, the respiratory protein, the C-reactive proteins, which function in the cytolytic destruction of foreign cells, including bacterial cells, and alpha2-macroglobulin, which inhibits the proteases of invading pathogens. Blood is collected by direct cardiac puncture under conditions that minimize contamination by lipopolysaccharide (a.k.a., endotoxin, LPS), a product of the Gram-negative bacteria. A large animal can yield 200 - 400 mL of blood. For the study of the plasma, blood cells are immediately removed from the plasma by centrifugation and the plasma can then be fractionated into its constituent proteins. The blood cells are conveniently studied microscopically by collecting small volumes of blood into LPS-free isotonic saline (0.5 M NaCl) under conditions that permit direct microscopic examination by placing one of more LPS-free coverglasses on the culture dish surface, then mounting those coverglasses in simple observation chambers following cell attachment. A second preparation for direct observation is to collect 3 - 5 mL of blood in a LPS-free embryo dish and then explanting fragments of aggregated amebocytes to a chamber that sandwiches the tissue between a slide and a coverglass. In this preparation, the motile amebocytes migrate onto the coverglass surface, where they can readily be observed. The blood clotting system involves aggregation of amebocytes and the formation of an extracellular clot of a protein, coagulin, which is released from the secretory granules of the blood cells. Biochemical analysis of washed blood cells requires that aggregation and degranulation does not occur, which can be accomplished by collecting blood into 0.1 volumes of 2% Tween-20, 0.5 M LPS-free NaCl, followed by centrifugation of the cells and washing with 0.5 M NaCl.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","19078938",2008,"United States"
"Isolation of mononuclear cells from the central nervous system of rats with EAE.","Whether studying an autoimmune disease directed to the central nervous system (CNS), such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, 1), or the immune response to an infection of the CNS, such as poliomyelitis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, or neurosyphilis, it is often necessary to isolate the CNS-infiltrating immune cells.In this video-protocol we demonstrate how to isolate mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the CNS of a rat with EAE. The first step of this procedure requires a cardiac perfusion of the rodent with a saline solution to ensure that no blood remains in the blood vessels irrigating the CNS. Any blood contamination will artificially increase the number of apparent CNS-infiltrating MNCs and may alter the apparent composition of the immune infiltrate. We then demonstrate how to remove the brain and spinal cord of the rat for subsequent dilaceration to prepare a single-cell suspension. This suspension is separated on a two-layer Percoll gradient to isolate the MNCs. After washing, these cells are then ready to undergo any required procedure. Mononuclear cells isolated using this procedure are viable and can be used for electrophysiology, flow cytometry (FACS), or biochemistry. If the technique is performed under sterile conditions (using sterile instruments in a tissue culture hood) the cells can also be grown in tissue culture medium. A given cell population can be further purified using either magnetic separation procedures or a FACS.","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","18989401",2008,"United States"
"Arrhythmogenic actions of the Ca2+ channel agonist FPL-64716 in Langendorff-perfused murine hearts.","The experiments explored the extent to which alterations in L-type Ca(2+) channel-mediated Ca(2+) entry triggers Ca(2+)-mediated arrhythmogenesis in Langendorff-perfused murine hearts through use of the specific L-type Ca(2+) channel modulator FPL-64716 (FPL). Introduction of FPL (1 microm) resulted in a gradual development (&gt;10 min) of diastolic electrical events and alternans in spontaneously beating hearts from which monophasic action potentials were recorded. In regularly paced hearts, they additionally led to non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT and sVT). Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) resulted in nsVT and sVT after 5-10 and &gt;10 min perfusion, respectively. Pretreatments with nifedipine, diltiazem and cyclopiazonic acid abolished arrhythmogenic tendency induced by subsequent introduction of FPL, consistent with its dependence upon both extracellular Ca(2+) entry and the degree of filling of the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) store. Values for action potential duration at 90% repolarization when any of these agents were applied to FPL-treated hearts became indistinguishable from those shown by untreated control hearts, in contrast to earlier reports of their altering in long QT syndrome type 3 and hypokalaemic murine models for re-entrant arrhythmogenesis. These arrhythmic effects instead correlated with alterations in Ca(2+) homeostasis at the single-cell level found in investigations of the effects of both FPL and the same agents in regularly stimulated fluo-3 loaded myocytes. These findings are compatible with a prolonged extracellular Ca(2+) entry that potentially results in an intracellular Ca(2+) overload and produces the cardiac arrhythmogenecity following addition of FPL.","Experimental physiology","18978037",2008,"United Kingdom"
"A Combined Approach Using Patch-Clamp Study and Computer Simulation Study for Understanding Long QT Syndrome and TdP in Women.","Female sex is an independent risk factor for development of torsade de pointes (TdP)-type arrhythmias in both congenital and acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS). In females, QT(c) interval and TdP risk vary during the menstrual cycle and around delivery. Biological experiments including single-cell current recordings with the patch-clamp technique and biochemical experiments show that progesterone modulates cardiac K(+) current and Ca(2+) current via the non-genomic pathway of the progesterone receptor, and thus the cardiac repolarization duration, in a concentration-dependent manner. Incorporation of these biological findings into a computer model of single-cell and coupled-cell cardiomyocytes simulates fluctuations in QT(c) interval during the menstrual cycle with reasonable accuracy. Based on this model, progesterone is predicted to have protective effects against sympathetic nervous system-induced arrhythmias in congenital LQTS and drug-induced TdP in acquired LQTS. A combined biological and computational approach may provide a powerful means to risk stratify TdP risk in women.","Current cardiology reviews","20066131",2008,"United States"
"Singular behavior of slow dynamics of single excitable cells.","In various kinds of cultured cells, it has been reported that the membrane potential exhibits fluctuations with long-term correlations, although the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. A cardiac muscle cell culture serves as an excellent experimental system to investigate this phenomenon because timings of excitations can be determined over an extended time period in a noninvasive manner through visualization of contractions, although the properties of beat-timing fluctuations of cardiac muscle cells at the single-cell level remains to be fully clarified. In this article, we report on our investigation of spontaneous contractions of cultured rat cardiac muscle cells at the single-cell level. It was found that single cells exhibit several typical temporal patterns of contractions and spontaneous transitions among them. Detrended fluctuation analysis on the time series of interbeat intervals revealed the presence of 1/f(beta) noise at sufficiently large timescales. Furthermore, multifractality was also found in the time series of interbeat intervals. These experimental trends were successfully explained using a simple mathematical model, incorporating correlated noise into ionic currents. From these findings, it was established that singular fluctuations accompanying 1/f(beta) noise and multifractality are intrinsic properties of single cardiac muscle cells.","Biophysical journal","18849418",2008,"United States"
"Can mesenchymal stem cells induce tolerance to cotransplanted human embryonic stem cells?","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are reported to be immune privileged. We assessed whether their transplantation (Tx) could create a suppressive microenvironment mitigating rejection of coinjected human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Three weeks after ligation-induced myocardial infarction, 40 immunocompetent rats received 150 microl of cardiac-specified hESCs (5 x 10(6)), MSCs (5 x 10(6)), hESC + MSC (5 x 10(6) for each), or control medium. Two months after Tx, left ventricle (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography, and hearts were processed for the detection of human cells by immunostaining and quantitative RT-PCR, patterns of rejection, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Two months after Tx, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly higher in the ESC and ESC + MSC groups compared with controls. There were few engrafted cells, which expressed markers of endothelial, smooth muscle, and ventricular cardiac cells, particularly in the MSC group. Hearts of all groups demonstrated a similar infiltration by CD4(+) and CD3(+) cells but MSC-Tx resulted in a greater infiltration of FoxP3 compared with the control and ESC-alone groups. No teratoma was observed. Thus, cotransplantation of ESCs and MSCs provided better functional preservation compared with single-cell treatment alone. However, there was only modest evidence for an immunosuppressive effect of coinjected MSCs and their beneficial effects seemed rather mediated by trophic effects on the host tissue.","Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy","18841094",2008,"United States"
"Different cardiovascular potential of adult- and fetal-type mesenchymal stem cells in a rat model of heart cryoinjury.","Efficacy of adult (bone marrow, BM) versus fetal (amniotic fluid, AF) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to replenish damaged rat heart tissues with new cardiovascular cells has not yet been established. We investigated on the differentiation potential of these two rat MSC populations in vitro and in a model of acute necrotizing injury (ANI) induced by cryoinjury. Isolated BM-MSCs and AF-MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and cytocentrifugation and their potential for osteogenic, adipogenic, and cardiovascular differentiation assayed in vitro using specific induction media. The left anterior ventricular wall of syngeneic Fisher 344 (n = 48) and athymic nude (rNu) rats (n = 6) was subjected to a limited, nontransmural epicardial ANI in the approximately one third of wall thickness without significant hemodynamic effects. The time window for in situ stem cell transplantation was established at day 7 postinjury. Fluorochrome (CMTMR)-labeled BM-MSCs (2 x 10(6)) or AF-MSCs (2 x 10(6)) were injected in syngeneic animals (n = 26) around the myocardial lesion via echocardiographic guidance. Reliability of CMTMR cell tracking in this context was ascertained by transplanting genetically labeled BM-MSCs or AF-MSCs, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), in rNu rats with ANI. Comparison between the two methods of cell tracking 30 days after cell transplantation gave slightly different values (1420,58 +/- 129,65 cells/mm2 for CMTMR labeling and 1613.18 +/- 643.84 cells/mm2 for genetic labeling; p = NS). One day after transplantation about one half CMTMR-labeled AF-MSCs engrafted to the injured heart (778.61 +/- 156.28 cells/mm2) in comparison with BM-MSCs (1434.50 +/- 173.80 cells/mm2, p &lt; 0.01). Conversely, 30 days after cell transplantation survived MSCs were similar: 1275.26 +/- 74.51/mm2 (AF-MSCs) versus 1420.58 +/- 129.65/mm2 for BM-MSCs (p = NS). Apparent survival gain of AF-MSCs between the two time periods was motivated by the cell proliferation rate calculated at day 30, which was lower for BM-MSCs (6.79 +/- 0.48) than AF-MSCs (10.83 +/- 3.50; p &lt; 0.01), in the face of a similar apoptotic index (4.68 +/- 0.20 for BM-MSCs and 4.16 +/- 0.58 for AF-MSCs; p = NS). These cells were also studied for their expression of markers specific for endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using von Willebrand factor (vWf), smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin, and cardiac troponin T, respectively. Grafted BM-MSCs or AF-MSCs were found as single cell/small cell clusters or incorporated in the wall of microvessels. A larger number of ECs (227.27 +/- 18.91 vs. 150.36 +/- 24.08 cells/mm2, p &lt; 0.01) and CMs (417.91 +/- 100.95 vs. 237.43 +/- 79.99 cells/mm2, p &lt; 0.01) originated from AF-MSCs than from BM-MSCs. Almost no SMCs were seen with AF-MSCs, in comparison to BM-MSCs (98.03 +/- 40.84 cells/mm2), in concordance with lacking of arterioles, which, instead, were well expressed with BM-MSCs (71.30 +/- 55.66 blood vessels/mm2). The number of structurally organized capillaries was slightly different with the two MSCs (122.49 +/- 17.37/mm2 for AF-MSCs vs. 148.69 +/- 54.41/mm2 for BM-MSCs; p = NS). Collectively, these results suggest that, in the presence of the same postinjury microenvironment, the two MSC populations from different sources are able to activate distinct differentiation programs that potentially can bring about a myocardial-capillary or myocardial-capillary-arteriole reconstitution.","Cell transplantation","18819256",2008,"United States"
"Cytomics and nanobioengineering.","The finding that an individual's genome differs as much as by many million variants from that of the human reference assembly diminished the great enthusiasm that every disease could be predicted based on nucleotide polymorphisms. Even individual cells of an organ may be specifically equipped to perform specific tasks and that the information of individual cells in a cell system is key information to understand function or dysfunction. Therefore, cytomics received great attention during the last years as it allows to quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing great number of individual cells, cell constituents, and of their intracellular and functional interactions in a cellular system and also giving the concept of analysis of these data.Exhaustive data extraction from multiparametric assays and multiple tests are the prerequisite for prediction of drug toxicity. Cytomics, as novel approach for unsupervised data analysis give a chance to find the most predictive parameters, which describe best the toxicity of a chemical. Cytomics is intrinsically connected to drug development and drug discovery.Focused on small structures, nanobioengineering is the ideal partner of cytomics, the systems biological discipline for cell population analysis. Realizing the idea &quot;from the molecule to the patient&quot; develops and offers chemical compounds, proteins, and other biomolecules, cells as well as tissues as instruments and products for a wide variety of biotechnological and biomedical applications.The integrative nanobioengineering combining different disciplines of nanotechnology will promote the development of innovative therapies and diagnostic methods. It can improve the precision of the measurements with focus on single cell analysis. By nanobioengineering and whole body imaging techniques, cytomics covers the field from molecules through bacterial cells, eukaryotic tissues, and organs to small animal live analysis. Toxicological testing and medical drug development are currently strongly broadening. It harbors the promise to substantially impact on various fields of biomedicine, drug discovery, and predictive medicine.As the number of scientific data is rising exponentially, new data analysis tools and strategies like cytomics and nanobioengineering take a lead and get closer to application.

"Myocardial injection of skeletal myoblasts impairs contractility of host cardiomyocytes.","BACKGROUND: Mechanisms underlying improvement of myocardial contractile function after cell therapy as well as arrhythmic side effect remain poorly understood. We hypothesised that cell therapy might affect the mechanical properties of isolated host cardiomyocytes.METHODS: Two weeks after myocardial infarction (MI), rats were treated by intramyocardial myoblast injection (SkM, n=8), intramyocardial vehicle injection (Medium, n=6), or sham operation (Sham, n=7). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Cardiomyocytes were isolated in a modified Langendorff perfusion system, their contraction was measured by video-based inter-sarcomeric analysis. Data were compared with a control-group without myocardial infarction (Control, n=5).RESULTS: Three weeks post-treatment, ejection fraction (EF) further deteriorated in vehicle-injected and non-injected rats (respectively 40.7+/-11.4% to 33+/-5.5% and 41.8+/-8% to 33.5+/-8.3%), but was stabilised in SkM group (35.9+/-6% to 36.4+/-9.7%). Significant cell hypertrophy induced by MI was maintained after cell therapy. Single cell contraction (dL/dt(max)) decreased in SkM and vehicle groups compared to non-injected group as well as cell shortening and relaxation (dL/dt(min)) in vehicle group. A significantly increased predisposition for alternation of strong and weak contractions was observed in isolated cardiomyocytes of the SkM group.CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first evidence that injection of materials into the myocardium alters host cardiomyocytes contractile function independently of the global beneficial effect of the heart function. These findings may be important in understanding possible adverse effects.","International journal of cardiology","18809218",2008,"Netherlands"
"Time-dependent block of ultrarapid-delayed rectifier K+ currents by aconitine, a potent cardiotoxin, in heart-derived H9c2 myoblasts and in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.","Aconitine (ACO), a highly toxic diterpenoid alkaloid, is recognized to have effects on cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channels. However, it remains unknown whether it has any effects on K(+) currents. The effects of ACO on ion currents in differentiated clonal cardiac (H9c2) cells and in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were investigated in this study. In H9c2 cells, ACO suppressed ultrarapid-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kur)) in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. The IC(50) value for ACO-induced inhibition of I(Kur) was 1.4 microM. ACO could accelerate the inactivation of I(Kur) with no change in the activation time constant of this current. Steady-state inactivation curve of I(Kur) during exposure to ACO could be demonstrated. Recovery from block by ACO was fitted by a single-exponential function. The inhibition of I(Kur) by ACO could still be observed in H9c2 cells preincubated with ruthenium red (30 microM). Intracellular dialysis with ACO (30 microM) had no effects on I(Kur). I(Kur) elicited by simulated action potential (AP) waveforms was sensitive to block by ACO. Single-cell Ca(2+) imaging revealed that ACO (10 microM) alone did not affect intracellular Ca(2+) in H9c2 cells. In cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, ACO also blocked I(Kur) and prolonged AP along with appearance of early afterdepolarizations. Multielectrode recordings on neonatal rat ventricular tissues also suggested that ACO-induced electrocardiographic changes could be associated with inhibition of I(Kur). This study provides the evidence that ACO can produce a depressant action on I(Kur) in cardiac myocytes.","Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology","18779382",2008,"United States"
"Discordant on/off switching of gene expression in myocytes during cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.","To determine whether the expression of cardiac genes changes in a graded manner or by on/off switching when cardiac myocytes change genetic programs in living animals, we have studied two indicator genes that change their expression oppositely in mouse binucleate ventricular cardiomyocytes during development and in response to cardiac hypertrophy. One is a single-copy transgene controlled by an alpha-myosin heavy chain (aMHC) promoter and coding for CFP. The other is the endogenous beta-myosin heavy chain (bMHC) gene modified to code for a YFP-bMHC fusion protein. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy, we determined the expression of the two indicator genes in individual cardiomyocytes perinatally and after inducing cardiac hypertrophy by transverse aortic constriction. Our results provide strong evidence that the cardiac genes respond by switching their expression in an on/off rather than graded manner, and that responding genes within a single cell and within the two nuclei of cardiomyocytes do not necessarily switch concordantly.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","18755891",2008,"United States"
"Thalamic neurons in the pigeon compute distance-to-collision of an approaching surface.","The thalamofugal and tectofugal pathways in birds are two parallel visual pathways to the telencephalon and might be comparable to the geniculocortical and colliculo-pulvinar-cortical pathways in mammals, respectively. It is known that some tectal neurons in the tectofugal pathway can signal the time-to-collision of an approaching object. Here we show by single cell recording in the pigeon that a population of visual neurons in the nucleus opticus principalis thalami (nOPT) in the thalamofugal pathway is able to detect the distance-to-collision of a large surface approaching towards the animal. These neurons began response firing when the surface reached a threshold distance to the viewing eye and thereafter their firing rates increased exponentially until collision occurred at distance = zero. The response onset distance is nearly constant for a wide range of stimulus velocities and is equal to the product of velocity of approaching stimulus and response onset time of a nOPT cell. Furthermore, onset distance of looming responses in nOPT cells is close to that causing cardioacceleration in the pigeon viewing the approaching surface. It appears that nOPT and tectal neurons are dichotomized functionally to a large extent for detecting imminent dangers, and the pigeon's ability to compute the distance-to-collision of an approaching surface may benefit avoiding large obstacles during flight.","Brain, behavior and evolution","18635928",2008,"Switzerland"
"Cell therapies: realizing the potential of this new dimension to medical therapeutics.","Stem cells promise to treat conditions poorly served by conventional therapeutics. Cells from both embryonic and somatic tissues are being used to create cell therapies for genetic, traumatic and degenerative conditions. The current human, healthcare and fiscal costs of these conditions are significant. This review summarizes the use of stem cells for neurological and cardiac disorders and diabetes to determine the requirements for generic translational research to assist such therapies to be a reality. While there are multiple strategies in each disease area, with no clear favourite, there are clear opportunities in treatments that use a single cell type. A key requirement is to work with pluripotent progenitor cells to cultivate and differentiate a sufficiently large population of functioning cells. Challenges also arise in determining and achieving timely delivery of the correct dose of cells to where they can most effectively treat the disease and best benefit individual patients.","Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine","18618613",2008,"England"
"Characteristics of spontaneous activity in the bladder trigone.","BACKGROUND: During bladder filling, the trigone contracts help keep the ureteral orifices open and the bladder neck shut. The trigone generates spontaneous activity as well as responding to neuromuscular transmitters, but the relationship between these phenomena are unclear.OBJECTIVES: To characterise the cellular mechanisms that regulate and modify spontaneous activity in trigone smooth muscle.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Muscle strips from the superficial trigone of male guinea-pigs were used for tension experiments and immunofluorescent studies.MEASUREMENTS: In isolated trigonal cells, intracellular Ca(2+) was measured by epifluorescence microscopy using the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator Fura-2.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Spontaneous intracellular Ca(2+) transients and contractions were observed in trigonal single cells and strips and were significantly higher compared to the bladder dome. Ca-free superfusate and verapamil terminated spontaneity. T-type Ca(2+) channel block with NiCl(2) depressed slightly Ca(2+) transients but not spontaneous contractions. Neither the BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin nor the SK(Ca) channel blocker apamin had any effect on single cell activity. By contrast, the Cl(-) channel blocker niflumic acid attenuated significantly both Ca(2+) transients and muscle contractions. Agonist stimulation (carbachol, phenylephrine) up-regulated activity. Gap junction labelling (Cx43) was approximately 5 times denser in the trigone than in detrusor smooth muscle. The gap junction blocker 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid modulated spontaneous contractions in the trigone but not in the bladder dome.CONCLUSIONS: Trigone myocytes employ membrane L-type-Ca(2+) channels and Cl(-) channels to generate spontaneous activity. Intercellular electrical coupling ensures its propagation and, thus, sustains contraction of the whole trigone.","European urology","18602741",2008,"United Kingdom"
"Swimming training can affect intrinsic calcium current characteristics in rat myocardium.","Endurance exercise is widely assumed to improve cardiac function in humans, but the mechanisms involved in such changes are not clearly understood. The purpose of this study is to determine whether training elicits adaptations at the level of the L-type Ca(2+) channel. Sprague-Dawley rats performed swimming training at either moderate intensity (MOD) or high intensity (HIGH) during 8 weeks. The trained rats were studied by echocardiography and the whole-cell L-type Ca(2+) currents (I (Ca,L)) characteristics in a single cell were measured by standard whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique. Echocardiography showed that septal and posterior wall thickness in MOD and HIGH increased with the increased LV mass by 43 and 41%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Training (P &lt; 0.05) increased mean myocyte capacitance (approximately 38% in MOD and HIGH) and myocyte length (approximately 20% longer in MOD and 26% longer in HIGH), thus providing electrophysiological and morphological evidence that the training elicited LV cardiocyte hypertrophy. Mean peak I (Ca,L) was not different in three groups. However, whole-cell I (Ca,L) density was decreased in MOD and HIGH versus sedentary (P &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference between MOD and HIGH. The present study provides the evidence of a training adaptation in intrinsic I (Ca,L) characteristics in ventricular myocardium, which demonstrates a remarkable adaptive plasticity of L-type channel characteristics in training rat heart.","European journal of applied physiology","18594852",2008,"Germany"
"Control of human embryonic stem cell colony and aggregate size heterogeneity influences differentiation trajectories.","To better understand endogenous parameters that influence pluripotent cell differentiation we used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model system. We demonstrate that differentiation trajectories in aggregate (embryoid body [EB])-induced differentiation, a common approach to mimic some of the spatial and temporal aspects of in vivo development, are affected by three factors: input hESC composition, input hESC colony size, and EB size. Using a microcontact printing approach, size-specified hESC colonies were formed by plating single-cell suspensions onto micropatterned (MP) extracellular matrix islands. Subsequently, size-controlled EBs were formed by transferring entire colonies into suspension culture enabling the independent investigation of colony and aggregate size effects on differentiation induction. Gene and protein expression analysis of MP-hESC populations revealed that the ratio of Gata6 (endoderm-associated marker) to Pax6 (neural-associated marker) expression increased with decreasing colony size. Moreover, upon forming EBs from these MP-hESCs, we observed that differentiation trajectories were affected by both colony and EB size-influenced parameters. In MP-EBs generated from endoderm-biased (high Gata6/Pax6) input hESCs, higher mesoderm and cardiac induction was observed at larger EB sizes. Conversely, neural-biased (low Gata6/Pax6) input hESCs generated MP-EBs that exhibited higher cardiac induction in smaller EBs. Our analysis demonstrates that heterogeneity in hESC colony and aggregate size, typical in most differentiation strategies, produces subsets of appropriate conditions for differentiation into specific cell types. Moreover, our findings suggest that the local microenvironment modulates endogenous parameters that can be used to influence pluripotent cell differentiation trajectories.","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","18583540",2008,"United States"
"Overexpression of TNNI3K, a cardiac-specific MAP kinase, promotes P19CL6-derived cardiac myogenesis and prevents myocardial infarction-induced injury.","TNNI3K is a new cardiac-specific MAP kinase whose gene is localized to 1p31.1 and that belongs to a tyrosine kinase-like branch in the kinase tree of the human genome. In the present study we investigated the role of TNNI3K in the cardiac myogenesis process and in the repair of ischemic injury. Pluripotent P19CL6 cells with or without transfection by pcDNA6-TNNI3K plasmid were used to induce differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes. TNNI3K promoted the differentiation process, judging from the increasing beating mass and increased number of alpha-actinin-positive cells. TNNI3K improved cardiac function by enhancing beating frequency and increasing the contractile force and epinephrine response of spontaneous action potentials without an increase of the single-cell size. TNNI3K suppressed phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I, annexin-V(+) cells, Bax protein, and p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Intramyocardial administration of TNNI3K-overexpressing P19CL6 cells in mice with myocardial infarction improved cardiac performance and attenuated ventricular remodeling compared with injection of wild-type P19CL6 cells. In conclusion, our study clearly indicates that TNNI3K promotes cardiomyogenesis, enhances cardiac performance, and protects the myocardium from ischemic injury by suppressing p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, modulation of TNNI3K activity would be a useful therapeutic approach for ischemic cardiac disease.","American journal of physiology.

"Modulation of {beta}-adrenoceptor signaling in the hearts of 4-wk simulated weightlessness rats.","The modulation of beta-adrenoceptor signaling in the hearts of hindlimb unweighting (HU) simulated weightlessness rats has not been reported. In the present study, we adopted the rat tail suspension for 4 wk to simulate weightlessness; then the effects of simulated microgravity on beta-adrenoceptor signaling were studied. Mean arterial blood pressure (ABP), left ventricular pressure (LVP), systolic function (+dP/dtmax), and diastolic function (-dP/dtmax) were monitored in the course of the in vivo experiment. Single rat ventricular myocyte was obtained by the enzymatic dissociation method. Hemodynamics, myocyte contraction, and cAMP production in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoproterenol or adenylyl cyclase stimulation with forskolin were measured, and Gs protein was also determined. Compared with the control group, no significant changes were found in heart weight, body weight and ABP, while LVP and +/-dP/dtmax were significantly reduced. The ABP decrease, LVP increase, and +/-dP/dtmax in response to isoproterenol administration were significantly attenuated in the HU group. The effects of isoproterenol on electrically induced single-cell contraction and cAMP production in myocytes of ventricles in the HU rats were significantly attenuated. The biologically active isoform, Gsalpha (45 kDa) in the heart, was unchanged. Both the increased electrically induced contraction and cAMP production in response to forskolin were also significantly attenuated in the simulated weightlessness rats. Above results indicated that impaired function of adenylyl cyclase causes beta-adrenoceptor desensitization, which may be partly responsible for the depression of cardiac function.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","18511523",2008,"United States"
"In vitro electrophysiological drug testing using human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.","Pro-arrhythmia (development of cardiac arrhythmias as a pharmacological side effect) has become the single most common cause of the withdrawal or restrictions of previously marketed drugs. The development of new medications, free from these side effects, is hampered by the lack of an in vitro assay for human cardiac tissue. We hypothesized that human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) assessed with a combination of single cell electrophysiology and microelectrode array (MEA) mapping can serve as a novel model for electrophysiological drug screening. Current-clamp studies revealed that E-4031 and Sotalol (IKr blockers) significantly increased hESC-CM's action potential duration and also induced after-depolarizations (the in vitro correlates of increased arrhythmogenic potential). Multicellular aggregates of hESC-CMs were then analyzed with the MEA technique. Application of class I (Quinidine, Procaineamide) and class III (Sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, E-4031, and Cisapride (a noncardiogenic agent known to lengthen QT) resulted in dose-dependent prolongation of the corrected field potential duration (cFPD). We next utilized the MEA technique to also assess pharmacological effects on conduction. Activation maps demonstrated significant conduction slowing following administration of Na channel blockers (Quinidine and Propafenone) and of the gap junction blocker (1-heptanol). While most attention has been focused on the prospects of using hESC-derived cardiomyocytes for regenerative medicine, this study highlights the possible utilization of these unique cells also for cardiac electrophysiological studies, drug screening, and target validation.","Stem cells and development","18510453",2008,"United States"
"Direct Loading of the purified endogenous inhibitor into the cytoplasm of patched cardiomyocytes blocks the ion currents and calcium transport through the NCX1 protein.","The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger in mammalian heart muscle (NCX1) is the central transporter protein that regulates extrusion of Ca(2+) from the heart cell. However, the functional biochemistry and physiology of NCX1 have been severely hampered by the absence of any specific high-affinity inhibitor. Here we describe advanced procedures for purifying a candidate inhibitor, previously called endogenous inhibitor factor (NCX(IF)), and demonstrate its direct actions on NCX1 activities in the single-cell system. A combination of advanced HILIC (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography) procedures with analytical tests suggests that the properties of NCX(IF) resemble those of a small (disaccharide size) polar molecule lacking any aromatic rings, conjugated bonds, or a primary amino group. The effects of NCX(IF) on the NCX1-mediated ion currents (I(NCX)) and cytosolic Ca(2+) extrusion were detected by a combination of patch-clamp and confocal microscopy under conditions in which the purified NCX(IF) was directly loaded into the cytoplasm of patched cardiomyocytes. It was demonstrated that cytosolic NCX(IF) blocks the Ca(2+)-activated NCX1 inward current and the accompanying extrusion of Ca(2+) from the cell with high efficacy. A constant fraction of NCX1 inhibition was observed under conditions in which the cytosolic [Ca(2+)](i) was varied at fixed doses of NCX(IF), suggesting that the degree of inhibition is controlled by NCX(IF) dose and not by cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. NCX(IF) blocks equally well both the Ca(2+) extrusion and Ca(2+) entry modes of NCX1, consistent with thermodynamic principles expected for the functioning of a bidirectional &quot;carrier-type&quot; transport system. We concluded that NCX(IF) interacts with a putative regulatory domain from the cytosolic side and, thus, may play an important regulatory role in controlling Ca(2+) signaling in the heart. This may represent a new potential tool for developing novel treatments for cardiac Ca(2+) signaling dysfunction.","Biochemistry","18507397",2008,"United States"
"The link between repolarisation alternans and ventricular arrhythmia: does the cellular phenomenon extend to the clinical problem?","T-wave alternans is considered a potentially useful clinical marker for the risk of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with heart disease. Cellular repolarisation alternans is thought to underlie T-wave alternans, and moreover, to cause re-entrant ventricular arrhythmia. This review examines the experimental and clinical evidence linking repolarisation alternans and T-wave alternans with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Repolarisation alternans, manifest as alternating changes in action potential duration, is observed in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes and in multicellular preparations. Its underlying causes are discussed particularly with respect to the role of intracellular Ca(2+). The repolarisation alternans observed at the single cell level is compared to the alternating behaviour observed in isolated multicellular preparations including the perfused ventricular wedge and Langendorff perfused heart. The evidence concerning spatial differences in repolarisation alternans is considered, particularly the situation where adjacent regions of myocardium exhibit repolarisation alternans of different phases. This extreme behaviour, known as discordant alternans, is thought to produce marked gradients of repolarisation that can precipitate unidirectional block and re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias. Finally, the difficulties in extrapolating between experimental models of alternans and arrhythmias and the clinical manifestation are discussed. The areas where experimental evidence is weak are highlighted, and areas for future research are outlined.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","18501925",2008,"United Kingdom"
"Computational analysis of the effects of the hERG channel opener NS1643 in a human ventricular cell model.","BACKGROUND: Dysfunction or pharmacologic inhibition of repolarizing cardiac ionic currents can lead to fatal arrhythmias. The hERG potassium channel underlies the repolarizing current I(Kr), and mutations therein can produce both long and short QT syndromes (LQT2 and SQT1). We previously reported on the diphenylurea compound NS1643, which acts on hERG channels in two distinct ways: by increasing overall conductance and by shifting the inactivation curve in the depolarized direction.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine which of the two components contributes more to the antiarrhythmic effects of NS1643 under normokalemic and hypokalemic conditions.METHODS: The study consisted of mathematical simulation of action potentials in a human ventricular ionic cell model in single cell and string of 100 cells.RESULTS: Regardless of external potassium concentration or diastolic interval used, NS1643 decreases action potential duration and triangulation. For single cells, NS1643 increases the postrepolarization refractory time but shortens the absolute refractory period. In one dimensional simulations, NS1643 increases the vulnerable window for unidirectional block but suppresses the emergence of premature action potentials and unidirectional blocks around APD(90). During normokalemia, shifting the inactivation curve has greater impact than increasing conductance, whereas the opposite occurs during hypokalemia.CONCLUSION: Increased hERG conductance and the depolarizing shift of the inactivation curve both contribute to the antiarrhythmic actions of NS1643, with relative effects dependent on external K(+) concentration.","Heart rhythm","18452879",2008,"United Kingdom"
"Microfabricated poly(ethylene glycol) templates enable rapid screening of triculture conditions for cardiac tissue engineering.","The purpose of this study was to design a simple system for cultivation of micro-scale cardiac organoids and investigate the effects of cellular composition on the organoid function. We hypothesized that cultivation of cardiomyocytes (CM) on preformed networks of fibroblasts (FB) and endothelial cells (EC) would enhance the structural and functional properties of the organoids, compared to simultaneously seeding the three cell types or cultivating enriched CM alone. Microchannels for cell seeding were created by photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate. In the preculture group the channels were seeded with a mixture of NIH 3T3 FB and D4T EC, following by addition of neonatal rat CM after 2 days of FB/EC preculture. The control microchannels were seeded simultaneously with FB/EC/CM (simultaneous triculture) or with enriched CM alone (enriched CM). Preculture resulted in cylindrical, contractile, and compact cardiac organoids that contained elongated CM expressing connexin-43 and cardiac troponin I. In contrast, simultaneous triculture resulted in noncontractile organoids with clusters of CM growing separately from elongated FBs and ECs. The staining for Connexin-43 was absent in the simultaneous triculture group. When fixed or frozen FB/EC were utilized as a preculture substrate for CM, noncontractile organoids were obtained; while preculture on a single cell type (either FB or EC) resulted in contractile organoids but with inferior properties compared to preculture with both FB/EC. These results emphasize the importance of living cells, presence of both nonmyocyte cell types as well as sequential seeding approach for cultivation of functional multicell type cardiac organoids.","Journal of biomedical materials research.

"Neonatal and adult cardiovascular pathophysiological remodeling and repair: developmental role of periostin.","The neonatal heart undergoes normal hypertrophy or compensation to complete development and adapt to increased systolic pressures. Hypertrophy and increased neonatal wall stiffness are associated with a doubling of the number of fibroblasts and de novo formation of collagen. Normal postnatal remodeling is completed within 3-4 weeks after birth but can be rekindled in adult life in response to environmental signals that lead to pathological hypertrophy, fibrosis, and heart failure. The signals that trigger fibroblast and collagen formation (fibrosis) as well as the origin and differentiation of the cardiac fibroblast lineage are not well understood. Using mice studies and a single-cell engraftment model, we have shown that cardiac fibroblasts are derived from two extracardiac sources: the embryonic proepicardial organ and the recruitment of circulating bone marrow cells of hematopoietic stem cell origin. Periostin, a matricellular protein, is normally expressed in differentiating fibroblasts but its expression is elevated several fold in pathological remodeling and heart failure. Our hypothesis that periostin is profibrogenic (i.e., it promotes differentiation of progenitor mesenchymal cells into fibroblasts and their secretion and compaction of collagen) was tested using isolated and cultured embryonic, neonatal, and adult wild-type and periostin-null, nonmyocyte populations. Our findings indicate that abrogation of periostin by targeted gene deletion inhibits differentiation of nonmyocyte progenitor cells or permits misdirection into a cardiomyocyte lineage. However, if cultured with periostin or forced to express periostin, they became fibroblasts. Periostin plays a significant role in promoting fibrogenesis residual stress, and tensile testings indicated that periostin played an essential regulatory role in maintaining the biomechanical properties of the adult myocardium. These findings indicate that periostin is a profibrogenic matricellular protein that promotes collagen fibrogenesis, inhibits differentiation of progenitor cells into cardiomyocytes, and is essential for maintaining the biomechanical properties of the adult myocardium.","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","18375575",2008,"United States"
"Adverse effects of methylene blue on the central nervous system.","BACKGROUND: An increasing number of clinical observations suggest adverse neurologic outcome after methylene blue (MB) infusion in the setting of parathyroid surgery. Hence, the aim of the current study was to investigate the potentially neurotoxic effects of MB using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches.METHODS: Isoflurane-anesthetized adult rats were used to evaluate the impact of a single bolus intravascular administration of MB on systemic hemodynamic responses and on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane using the tail clamp test. In vivo, MB-induced cell death was evaluated 24 h after MB administration using Fluoro-Jade B staining and activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. In vitro, neurotoxic effects of MB were examined in hippocampal slice cultures by measuring excitatory field potentials as well as propidium iodide incorporation after MB exposure. The impact of MB on dendritic arbor was evaluated in differentiated single cell neuronal cultures.RESULTS: Bolus injections of MB significantly reduced isoflurane MAC and initiated widespread neuronal apoptosis. Electrophysiologic recordings in hippocampal slices revealed a rapid suppression of evoked excitatory field potentials by MB, and this was associated with a dose-dependent effect of this drug on cell death. Dose-response experiments in single cell neuronal cultures revealed that a 2-h-long exposure to MB at non-cell-death-inducing concentrations could still induce significant retraction of dendritic arbor.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MB exerts neurotoxic effects on the central nervous system and raise questions regarding the safety of using this drug at high doses during parathyroid gland surgery.","Anesthesiology","18362601",2008,"United States"
"Excito-oscillatory dynamics as a mechanism of ventricular fibrillation.","BACKGROUND: The instabilities associated with reentrant spiral waves are of paramount importance to the initiation and maintenance of tachyarrhythmias, especially ventricular fibrillation (VF). In addition to tissue heterogeneities, there are only a few basic purported mechanisms of spiral wave breakup, most notably restitution.OBJECTIVE: We test the hypothesis that oscillatory membrane properties act to destabilize spiral waves.METHODS: We recorded transmembrane potential (V(m)) from isolated rabbit myocytes using a constant current stimulation protocol. We developed a mathematical model that included both the stable excitable equilibrium point at resting V(m) (-80 mV) and the unstable oscillatory equilibrium point at elevated V(m) (-10 mV). Spiral wave dynamics were studied in 2-dimensional grids using variants of the model.RESULTS: All models showed restitution and reproduced the experimental values of transmembrane resistance at rest and during the action potential plateau. Stable spiral waves were observed when the model showed only 1 equilibrium point. However, spatio-temporal complexity was observed if the model showed both excitable and oscillatory equilibrium points (i.e., excito-oscillatory models). The initial wave breaks resulted from oscillatory waves expanding in all directions; after a few beats, the patterns were characterized by a combination of unstable spiral waves and target patterns consistent with the patterns observed on the heart surface during VF. In our model, this VF-like activity only occurred when the single cell period of V(m) oscillations was within a specific range.CONCLUSION: The VF-like patterns observed in our excito-oscillatory models could not be explained by the existing proposed instability mechanisms. Our results introduce the important suggestion that membrane dynamics responsible for V(m) oscillations at elevated V(m) levels can destabilize spiral waves and thus may be a novel therapeutic target for preventing VF.","Heart rhythm","18362026",2008,"United States"
"Melanopsin ganglion cells use a membrane-associated rhabdomeric phototransduction cascade.","Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are photoreceptors of the mammalian eye that drive pupillary responses, synchronization of circadian rhythms, and other reflexive responses to daylight. Melanopsin is the ipRGC photopigment, but the signaling cascade through which this invertebrate-like opsin triggers the photocurrent in these cells is unknown. Here, using patch-clamp recordings from dissociated ipRGCs in culture, we show that a membrane-associated phosphoinositide cascade lies at the heart of the ipRGC phototransduction mechanism, similar to the cascade in rhabdomeric photoreceptors of invertebrate eyes. When ipRGCs were illuminated, melanopsin activated a G protein of the G(q/11) class, stimulating the effector enzyme phospholipase C. The presence of these signaling components in ipRGCs was confirmed by single-cell RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. The photoresponse was fully functional in excised inside-out patches of ipRGC membrane, indicating that all core signaling components are within or tightly coupled to the plasma membrane. The striking similarity of phototransduction in ipRGCs and invertebrate rhabdomeric photoreceptors reinforces the emerging view that these cells have a common evolutionary origin.","Journal of neurophysiology","18305089",2008,"United States"
"Fluorescent protein reporter systems for single-cell measurements.","The unraveling of the complex dynamic networks that underlie cellular (and, by extension, tissue, organ, and organism) function requires sophisticated mathematical models and, in order to test those models, rich data sets. In addition, even in clonal populations of cells, there is a wide range of variability in cellular function at any given time, even in simple parameters such as the concentration of critical signaling components such as receptors or transcription factors. It remains a matter of conjecture as to whether this is noise, to which the system is inherently robust, or whether the cellular control network can exist in multiple discrete internal states, with indistinguishable input/output characteristics. Fluorescent protein-based methods have two features useful for addressing these issues. First, they can be used to retrieve data from individual cells. Second, in combination with confocal fluorescence microscopy, they can be used nondestructively and can thus follow one or more individual cells in culture or in an intact organism over time.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","18287641",2008,"United Kingdom"

Nevertheless, metal release due to corrosion phenomena appears to play a crucial role for human health. Thus, the goal of the present study was to evaluate whether liver, kidney, and lung are particularly sensitive organs for DNA damaging and cytotoxicity following implantation of internal fixture materials composed by titanium alloy in vivo. A total of 18 rats underwent surgical titanium miniplates in their tibias, being randomly distributed into three groups: 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days after implantation. A total of six animals served as negative control (animals that not received any implant). After experimental design, the lung, liver, and kidney were removed for histopatological and genotoxic analysis as depicted by H.E. stain and single cell gel (comet) assay, respectively. No significant statistically differences (p &gt; 0.05) for DNA damaging were found to all experimental groups when compared to negative control for all organs evaluated. In addition, no remarkable morphological alterations were detected under histopathological analysis. Taken together, such results suggest that titanium miniplates are neither able to induce DNA damage in multiple organs nor to cause some abnormalities in lung, liver, and kidney.","Journal of biomedical materials research.

"Induction of NO synthase 2 in ventricular cardiomyocytes incubated with a conventional bicarbonate dialysis bath.","BACKGROUND: In hypotension-prone patients, conventional bicarbonate dialysis (BD) causes a reduced cardiovascular tolerance to the treatment with respect to acetate-free biofiltration (AFB). One possible explanation is an overproduction of endogenous NO (nitric oxide) due to the residual quote of acetate (4 mM) in the BD dialysate formulation. NO overload might cause the impairment of cardiovascular reactivity observed during BD. In this study, a potential direct impact of the residual quote of acetate on the cardiac cells was investigated.METHODS: Ventricular cardiac myocytes isolated from adult rat hearts were treated with three different dialysis baths with or without acetate: BD, AFB and AFB + 4 mM of acetate (AFB(+)). Corresponding levels of expression of the inducible NO synthase 2 (NOS2) were assessed after the treatments along with the measurement of single-cell action potential (AP).RESULTS: Incubation with acetate-containing dialysis solutions significantly enhanced (P &lt; 0.05) the expression of NOS2 mRNA (BD: 1.11 +/- 0.31; AFB(+): 0.73 +/- 0.04, NOS2/GAPDH intensitometric ratio) with respect to the acetate-free bath (AFB: 0.03 +/- 0.01). Accordingly, protein translation was also enhanced (BD: 0.176 +/- 0.021; AFB(+): 0.135 +/- 0.009, NOS2/alpha-tubuline intensitometric ratio) with respect to AFB (0.002 +/- 0.001, P &lt; 0.05). Measurement of the AP indicates that acetate-containing solutions determine a shortening of the repolarization phase as compared to treatment with AFB (BD: 95 +/- 13; AFB(+): 76 +/- 10; AFB: 162 +/- 16 ms).CONCLUSION: These findings show that the residual quote of acetate of the BD bath formulation affects the expression of NOS2 and the duration of AP in cardiac cells. This might cause the cardiac contractile impairment in unstable patients during BD treatment.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association","18281316",2008,"England"
"Cardiomyogenic gene expression profiling of differentiating human embryonic stem cells.","Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into a variety of specialized cell types. Thus, they provide a model system for embryonic development to investigate the molecular processes of cell differentiation and lineage commitment. The development of the cardiac lineage is easily detected in mixed cultures by the appearance of spontaneously contracting areas of cells. We performed gene expression profiling of undifferentiated and differentiating hESCs and monitored 468 genes expressed during cardiac development and/or in cardiac tissue. Their transcription during early differentiation of hESCs through embryoid bodies (EBs) was investigated and compared with spontaneously differentiating hESCs maintained on feeders in culture without passaging (high-density (HD) protocol). We observed a larger variation in the gene expression between cells from a single cell line that were differentiated using two different protocols than in cells from different cell lines that were cultured according to the same protocol. Notably, the EB protocol resulted in more reproducible transcription profiles than the HD protocol. The results presented here provide new information about gene regulation during early differentiation of hESCs with emphasis on the cardiomyogenic program. In addition, we also identified regulatory elements that could prove critical for the development of the cardiomyocyte lineage.","Journal of biotechnology","18241947",2008,"Netherlands"
"[Effects of marrow-derived cardiac stem cell transplantation after myocardial infarction in rats].","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of marrow-derived cardiac stem cell (MCSC) transplantation after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats.METHODS: MCSC were selected from the marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MMSC) of male SD rats by single-cell cloning culture. MI was induced by left anterior descending artery ligating in female SD rats. Equal volume PBS, MMSC and MCSC were transplanted at the border zone of the infarct one week after MI. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography at four weeks after cell transplantation. The hearts were removed and morphological changes of scar tissue were examined with HE staining and Masson trichrome staining, VEGFR-1(+) capillary vessels were labeled with immunohistochemical staining. Scar area and vessel density were measured by image analyzer. MCSC containing Y chromosome were examined using in situ fluorescent hybridization, and cardiomyocyte cTnT expression was also analyzed.RESULTS: Cardiac transcription factor Nkx2.5 was expressed at low level in c-kit(+) MCSC. Four weeks after cell transplantation, left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction were significantly higher while scar area was significantly lower in MCSC group compared to MMSC group and control group. cTnT was expressed in cells containing Y chromosome and these cells were connected with myocardium of recipient rats in the rats transplanted with MCSC. Vessel density around the infarcted tissue in MCSC group was similar as that in MMSC group and significantly higher than that in control group.CONCLUSION: MSCS could effectually differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes at the border zone of the infarct, and MCSC transplantation post MI significantly improved cardiac functions and promoted angiogenesis.","Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi","18206045",2008,"China"
"Asymmetric involution of the myocardial field drives heart tube formation in zebrafish.","Many vertebrate organs are derived from monolayered epithelia that undergo morphogenesis to acquire their shape. Whereas asymmetric left/right gene expression within the zebrafish heart field has been well documented, little is known about the tissue movements and cellular changes underlying early cardiac morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that asymmetric involution of the myocardium of the right-posterior heart field generates the ventral floor, whereas the noninvoluting left heart field gives rise to the dorsal roof of the primary heart tube. During heart tube formation, asymmetric left/right gene expression within the myocardium correlates with asymmetric tissue morphogenesis. Disruption of left/right gene expression causes randomized myocardial tissue involution. Time-lapse analysis combined with genetic analyses reveals that motility of the myocardial epithelium is a tissue migration process. Our results demonstrate that asymmetric morphogenetic movements of the 2 bilateral myocardial cell populations generate different dorsoventral regions of the zebrafish heart tube. Failure to generate a heart tube does not affect the acquisition of atrial versus ventricular cardiac cell shapes. Therefore, establishment of basic cardiac cell shapes precedes cardiac function. Together, these results provide the framework for the integration of single cell behaviors during the formation of the vertebrate primary heart tube.","Circulation research","18202314",2008,"United States"
"[Allogeneic dendritic cell vaccine pulsed with heat shocked tumor cell lysate can enhance antitumor immunity].","OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the allogeneic dendritic cells-pulsed with heat shock protein (HSP)-70-rich tumor cell lysate can enhance the antitumor immunity.METHODS: Mouse Lewis lung cancer cells were dipped into water of the temperature of 43 degrees C for 1 h so as to undergo heat shock. C57BLK(b)) to elicit increased hsp70 expression, The LLCs were lysed by freeze thawing and the supernatant was collected (LhTCL). Dendritic cells (DCs) were isolated from allogeneic inbred mice (615Kk or BALB/CKd) bone marrow (Bm-DCs), and were pulsed with the LhTCL that underwent heart shock. The phenotypes of the Bm-DCs were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The level of IL-12 was detected by ELISA. The Bm-Dcs of Balb/c mice that were pulsed by LhTCL or not, were injected into the foot pads of C57BL mice as vaccine, 3 d later the lymph nodes in the drainage area of popliteal fossa were taken out to make single cell suspension to undergo immunohistochemistry. Inducible hsp70 in LhTCL was assayed by Western Blotting. The ability of taking up LhTCL by immature DC was evaluated by phagocytosis experiment in vitro and the uptake of CFSE labeled allogeneic DC by recipient DC was evaluated by tracing experiment in vivo. The supernatant cytokine release was determined by sandwich ELISA. Double stained DC was confirmed by FCM and confocal microscopy. Cytotoxic activity was assessed by LDH release assay. The immuno-effect of vaccine was valued by immunoprophylaxis in LLC transplanted model and therapy experiment of LLC-bearing mice of early stage.RESULT: 43 degrees C heating significantly increased the expression of inducible hsp70 in the LLCs. The allogeneic immature DC s showed full ability to uptake LhTCL and enhanced the expression of CD86 molecules on DC surface and IL-12 secretion, showing that they promoted the maturation of DCs. Subcutaneous injection of allogeneic DC/LhTCL promoted the uptake of allogeneic DC by recipient DC. The spleen cells from the C57BL mice immunized with allogeneic DC/LhTCL vaccine specifically killed the viable LLCs, and secreted Th-1 related cytokine (i.e. high level of INF-gamma and low level of IL-4/IL-10). The experiment of immunoprophylaxis of LLC transplant and therapy of LLC-bearing C57BL mice both confirmed that immunization with allogeneic DC/LhTCL prevented or delayed the growth of LLCs, which elicited higher immunological effect than that with syngeneic DCs/HLTCL.CONCLUSION: Immunization with vaccine of allogeneic DC pulsed with heat shocked hsp70-rich tumor cell lysate is able to enhance antitumor immunity.","Zhonghua yi xue za zhi","18167273",2008,"China"
"Cardiomyocytes from human and mouse embryonic stem cells.","Human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate to cardiomyocytes in culture. They are therefore of interest for studying early human and mouse heart development, as well as properties of cardiomyocytes from both species, including their responses to cardiac drugs, and, at some point in the future, may represent a source of transplantable cells for cardiac muscle repair. The differentiation protocols that are effective depend in part on the species from which the ES cell lines were derived, and in part on the individual cell lines and the methods used for their propagation prior to differentiation. Here, several methods for generating and characterizing cardiomyocytes from mouse and human ES cells are described, as well as methods for dissociation of cardiomyocytes into single-cell suspensions which are useful both for characterizing cells by antibody staining and electrophysiological measurements, as well as preparing cells for transplantation into (animal) hearts.","Methods in molecular medicine","18085213",2007,"United States"
"Asymptotic analysis and analytical solutions of a model of cardiac excitation.","We describe an asymptotic approach to gated ionic models of single-cell cardiac excitability. It has a form essentially different from the Tikhonov fast-slow form assumed in standard asymptotic reductions of excitable systems. This is of interest since the standard approaches have been previously found inadequate to describe phenomena such as the dissipation of cardiac wave fronts and the shape of action potential at repolarization. The proposed asymptotic description overcomes these deficiencies by allowing, among other non-Tikhonov features, that a dynamical variable may change its character from fast to slow within a single solution. The general asymptotic approach is best demonstrated on an example which should be both simple and generic. The classical model of Purkinje fibers (Noble in J. Physiol. 160:317-352, 1962) has the simplest functional form of all cardiac models but according to the current understanding it assigns a physiologically incorrect role to the Na current. This leads us to suggest an &quot;Archetypal Model&quot; with the simplicity of the Noble model but with a structure more typical to contemporary cardiac models. We demonstrate that the Archetypal Model admits a complete asymptotic solution in quadratures. To validate our asymptotic approach, we proceed to consider an exactly solvable &quot;caricature&quot; of the Archetypal Model and demonstrate that the asymptotic of its exact solution coincides with the solutions obtained by substituting the &quot;caricature&quot; right-hand sides into the asymptotic solution of the generic Archetypal Model. This is necessary, because, unlike in standard asymptotic descriptions, no general results exist which can guarantee the proximity of the non-Tikhonov asymptotic solutions to the solutions of the corresponding detailed ionic model.","Bulletin of mathematical biology","18060462",2007,"United States"
"Progesterone regulates cardiac repolarization through a nongenomic pathway: an in vitro patch-clamp and computational modeling study.","BACKGROUND: Female sex is an independent risk factor for torsade de pointes in long-QT syndrome. In women, QT interval and torsade de pointes risk fluctuate dynamically during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Accumulating clinical evidence suggests a role for progesterone; however, the effect of progesterone on cardiac repolarization remains undetermined.METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of progesterone on action potential duration and membrane currents in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Progesterone rapidly shortened action potential duration, which was attributable mainly to enhancement of the slow delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) under basal conditions and inhibition of L-type Ca2+ currents (I(Ca,L)) under cAMP-stimulated conditions. The effects of progesterone were mediated by nitric oxide released via nongenomic activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase; this signal transduction likely takes place in the caveolae because sucrose density gradient fractionation experiments showed colocalization of the progesterone receptor c-Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase with KCNQ1, KCNE1, and Ca(V)1.2 in the caveolae fraction. We used computational single-cell and coupled-tissue action potential models incorporating the effects of progesterone on I(Ks) and I(Ca,L); the model reproduces the fluctuations of cardiac repolarization during the menstrual cycle observed in women and predicts the protective effects of progesterone against rhythm disturbances in congenital and drug-induced long-QT syndrome.CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that progesterone modulates cardiac repolarization by nitric oxide produced via a nongenomic pathway. A combination of experimental and computational analyses of progesterone effects provides a framework to understand complex fluctuations of QT interval and torsade de pointes risks in various hormonal states in women.","Circulation","18056530",2007,"United States"
"Horizontal gene transfer from human endothelial cells to rat cardiomyocytes after intracoronary transplantation.","AIMS: Recent studies suggested that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells in vitro. To test the functional relevance of this observation, we examined the transdifferentiation potential of HUVECs in vivo after intracoronary cell application in Wistar rats.METHODS AND RESULTS: SPECT measurements (single photon emission computed tomography) revealed that 18% of (111)In-labelled HUVECs infused by intracoronary delivery stably transplanted to the rat heart. For long-term tracking, HUVECs-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were infused. Two days following transplantation, HUVECs were positive for caspase-3. Within 3 days, EGFP was associated with individual cardiomyocytes. No labelling of endothelial and smooth muscle cells was observed. The total number of EGFP-labelled cardiomyocytes accounted for 58% of all initially trapped cells. These EGFP positive cells stained negatively for human mitochondrial proteins, but were positive for rat monocarboxylate transporter-1 protein (MCT-1). Furthermore, EGFP-mRNA was detected in these cells by single-cell RT-PCR (reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction). After 21 days, EGFP positive cells were no longer observed. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we generated in vitro apoptotic bodies from EGFP-labelled HUVECs and found them to contain the genetic information for EGFP. Co-incubation of apoptotic bodies with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes caused cardiomyocytes to express EGFP.CONCLUSION: When transplanted into the rat heart by efficient intracoronary delivery, EGFP-expressing HUVECs cause the exclusive but transient labelling of cardiomyocytes. Our in vivo findings suggest that it is not cell fusion and/or transdifferentiation that occurs under these conditions but rather a horizontal gene transfer of the EGFP marker via apoptotic bodies from endothelial cells to cardiomyocytes.","Cardiovascular research","18006428",2007,"England"
"Analysis of arterial intimal hyperplasia: review and hypothesis.","BACKGROUND: Despite a prodigious investment of funds, we cannot treat or prevent arteriosclerosis and restenosis, particularly its major pathology, arterial intimal hyperplasia. A cornerstone question lies behind all approaches to the disease: what causes the pathology?HYPOTHESIS: I argue that the question itself is misplaced because it implies that intimal hyperplasia is a novel pathological phenomenon caused by new mechanisms. A simple inquiry into arterial morphology shows the opposite is true. The normal multi-layer cellular organization of the tunica intima is identical to that of diseased hyperplasia; it is the standard arterial system design in all placentals at least as large as rabbits, including humans. Formed initially as one-layer endothelium lining, this phenotype can either be maintained or differentiate into a normal multi-layer cellular lining, so striking in its resemblance to diseased hyperplasia that we have to name it &quot;benign intimal hyperplasia&quot;. However, normal or &quot;benign&quot; intimal hyperplasia, although microscopically identical to pathology, is a controllable phenotype that rarely compromises blood supply. It is remarkable that each human heart has coronary arteries in which a single-layer endothelium differentiates early in life to form a multi-layer intimal hyperplasia and then continues to self-renew in a controlled manner throughout life, relatively rarely compromising the blood supply to the heart, causing complications requiring intervention only in a small fraction of the population, while all humans are carriers of benign hyperplasia. Unfortunately, this fundamental fact has not been widely appreciated in arteriosclerosis research and medical education, which continue to operate on the assumption that the normal arterial intima is always an &quot;ideal&quot; single-layer endothelium. As a result, the disease is perceived and studied as a new pathological event caused by new mechanisms. The discovery that normal coronary arteries are morphologically indistinguishable from deadly coronary arteriosclerosis continues to elicit surprise.CONCLUSION: Two questions should inform the priorities of our research: (1) what controls switch the single cell-layer intimal phenotype into normal hyperplasia? (2) how is normal (benign) hyperplasia maintained? We would be hard-pressed to gain practical insights without scrutinizing our premises.","Theoretical biology &amp; medical modelling","17974015",2007,"England"
"Field stimulation of cells in suspension: use of a hybrid finite element method.","Electric fields are used in a range of applications, including gene transfection, electrochemotherapy of tumors and cardiac defibrillation. Despite the widespread use of electric fields, most of the theoretical and computational studies on discrete cellular tissue have focused on a single cell. In this work, we propose a hybrid finite element method to simulate the effects of external electric fields on clusters of excitable cells. The method can be used to model cells of arbitrary cell geometries and non-linear membrane dynamics. The results show that the response of multiple cell, like a single cell, is a two-stage process consisting of the initial polarization that proceeds with cellular time constant (less than one microsecond) and the actual excitation of the cell membrane that proceeds with the membrane time constant (on the order of milliseconds). The results also show that the stimulation of a given cell depends in part on the arrangement of cells within the field and not simply the location within the field, suggesting that classical approaches that ignores the effect of the cells on the field do not adequately predict the cellular response.","Conference proceedings : ...

"Mutations of mitochondrial DNA - cause or consequence of the ageing process?","Ageing is a stochastic process which leads to a gradual decline in cellular, tissue and even organ function, especially in energy dependent postmitotic tissues like skeletal muscle, brain and heart. The mitochondrial theory of ageing is based on the assumption that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals generated in the immediate vicinity of the electron transport chain during the lifespan of an organism damage proteins, lipids and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Whereas it was generally believed that mitochondria are among the important players regarding the ageing process, two recent important approaches shed new light on the complex interactions. It has been shown by single cell experiments and computer simulation models that mitochondrial mutations are generated stochastically in childhood or early adolescence and accumulate clonally in a cell or muscle fibre, leading to a local age related impairment of cellular energy supply. Other important observations come from mitochondrial mutator mice, harbouring mitochondrial mutations due to a deficient repair enzyme (POLG). These mice reveal a premature senescence but do not exhibit a vicious cycle of increased oxidative damage or ROS production as has been postulated by the mitochondrial theory of ageing. At the moment it is hard to decide, if mitochondrial mutations are the cause or consequence of human ageing, but it is suggested that mitochondrial point mutations are just the consequence, while deletions seem to play a causal role.","Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie","17943235",2007,"Germany"
"Removal of FKBP12.6 does not alter the conductance and activation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor or the susceptibility to stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias.","The 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12.6) is considered to be a key regulator of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), but its precise role in RyR2 function is complex and controversial. In the present study we investigated the impact of FKBP12.6 removal on the properties of the RyR2 channel and the propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Single channel recordings in lipid bilayers showed that FK506 treatment of recombinant RyR2 co-expressed with or without FKBP12.6 or native canine RyR2 did not induce long-lived subconductance states. [(3)H]Ryanodine binding studies revealed that coexpression with or without FKBP12.6 or treatment with or without FK506 did not alter the sensitivity of RyR2 to activation by Ca(2+) or caffeine. Furthermore, single cell Ca(2+) imaging analyses demonstrated that HEK293 cells co-expressing RyR2 and FKBP12.6 or expressing RyR2 alone displayed the same propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release or store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). FK506 increased the amplitude and decreased the frequency of SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 with or without FKBP12.6, indicating that the action of FK506 on SOICR is independent of FKBP12.6. As with recombinant RyR2, the conductance and ligand-gating properties of single RyR2 channels from FKBP12.6-null mice were indistinguishable from those of single wild type channels. Moreover, FKBP12.6-null mice did not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias, in contrast to previous reports. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the loss of FKBP12.6 has no significant effect on the conduction and activation of RyR2 or the propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias.","The Journal of biological chemistry","17921453",2007,"United States"
"Repolarisation and vulnerability to re-entry in the human heart with short QT syndrome arising from KCNQ1 mutation--a simulation study.","Idiopathic short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a recently identified, genetically heterogeneous condition characterised by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies mechanisms by which cellular electrophysiological changes in the SQT2 (slow delayed rectifier, IKs, -linked) SQTS variant increases arrhythmia risk. The channel kinetics of the V307L mutation of the KCNQ1 subunit of the IKs channel were incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D transmural tissue simulations. Incorporating the V307L mutation into simulations reproduced defining features of the SQTS: abbreviation of the QT interval, and increases in T wave amplitude and Tpeak-Tend duration. In the single-cell model, the V307L mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarisation (APD90) and increased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (deltaV) during APs; this resulted in augmented transmural heterogeneity of APD90 and of the effective refractory period (ERP). In the intact tissue model, the vulnerable window for unidirectional conduction block was also increased. In 2D tissue the V307L mutation facilitated and maintained reentrant excitation. Thus, in SQT2 increases in transmural heterogeneity of APD, deltaV, ERP and an increased vulnerable window for unidirectional conduction block generate an electrical substrate favourable to reentrant arrhythmia.","Progress in biophysics and molecular biology","17905416",2007,"United Kingdom"
"Osmotic stress and DNA damage.","Mammalian renal inner medullary cells are normally exposed to extremely high NaCl concentrations. The interstitial NaCl concentration in parts of a normal renal medulla can be 500 mM or more, depending on the species. Remarkably, under these normal conditions, the high NaCl causes DNA damage, yet the cells survive and function both in cell culture and in vivo. Both in cell culture and in vivo the breaks are repaired rapidly if the NaCl concentration is lowered. This chapter describes two methods used to detect and study the DNA damage induced by osmotic stress: comet assay or single cell electrophoresis and TUNEL assay or in situ labeling of 3'-OH ends of DNA strands. This chapter also discusses how specifics of the protocols influence the conclusions about types of DNA damage and what the limitations of these methods are for detecting different types of DNA damage.","Methods in enzymology","17875421",2007,"United States"
"Phase resetting in one-dimensional model of the sinoatrial node.","In this paper, we use a one-dimensional model of the rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN), and we investigate the response of the model to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing stimulus. Depending on the stimulus timing, either a delay or an advance in the occurrence of next action potential is produced. This resetting behavior of the model is quantified in terms of phase transition curves (PTCs) for short electrical current pulses of varying amplitude which span the whole period. The main focus of this paper is to compare the dynamic properties of the spatially extended system and the single cell model. The detailed analysis of the results provides new insights in the understanding of the transition from the theoretical single cell models to the spatially extended systems.","IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering","17867365",2007,"United States"
"The heart rate-lowering agent ivabradine inhibits the pacemaker current I(f) in human atrial myocytes.","INTRODUCTION: It has been speculated that pacemaker current (I(f)) in human atria could play a role in causing ectopic atrial automaticity. Ivabradine is a novel selective and specific I(f) inhibitor in the sinus node that reduces heart rate without any negative inotropic effect. The aim of the study was to explore possible effects of ivabradine on I(f) in atrial myocytes.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using patch-clamp technique, we studied effects of ivabradine on I(f) present in atrial myocytes isolated from human right appendages of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The identification of HCN isoforms was obtained by means of multiplex single-cell RT-PCR. Ivabradine induced a marked concentration and use-dependent I(f) inhibition with an IC50 at steady state of 2.9 microM. Time constant of block development (Tau(on)) decreases with the increase in the ivabradine concentration. Use-dependent inhibition induced by ivabradine (3 microM) was not modified in the presence of cAMP (10 microM) in the pipette solution. Multiplex single-cell RT-PCR indicates that the major HCN gene subtype detected in atria was HCN2. HCN4 is detected weakly and HCN1 is not significantly detected.CONCLUSIONS: Ivabradine inhibits I(f) current in the nonpacemaker cell with characteristics similar to those described previously in rabbit sinus node cells, but revealed a lesser sensitivity for I(f) recorded in human atrial cell than hHCN4 subunits considered as the major contributors to native f-channels in human sinoatrial node. A potential protection of atrial arrhythmias by ivabradine is discussed.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","17850290",2007,"United States"
"Prenatally fabricated autologous human living heart valves based on amniotic fluid derived progenitor cells as single cell source.","BACKGROUND: A novel concept providing prenatally tissue engineered human autologous heart valves based on routinely obtained fetal amniotic fluid progenitors as single cell source is introduced.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fetal human amniotic progenitors were isolated from routinely sampled amniotic fluid and sorted using CD133 magnetic beads. After expansion and differentiation, cell phenotypes of CD133- and CD133+ cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry. After characterization, CD133- derived cells were seeded onto heart valve leaflet scaffolds (n=18) fabricated from rapidly biodegradable polymers, conditioned in a pulse duplicator system, and subsequently coated with CD133+ derived cells. After in vitro maturation, opening and closing behavior of leaflets was investigated. Neo-tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Extracellular matrix (ECM) elements and cell numbers were quantified biochemically. Mechanical properties were assessed by tensile testing. CD133- derived cells demonstrated characteristics of mesenchymal progenitors expressing CD44 and CD105. Differentiated CD133+ cells showed features of functional endothelial cells by eNOS and CD141 expression. Engineered heart valve leaflets demonstrated endothelialized tissue formation with production of ECM elements (GAG 80%, HYP 5%, cell number 100% of native values). SEM showed intact endothelial surfaces. Opening and closing behavior was sufficient under half of systemic conditions.CONCLUSIONS: The use of amniotic fluid as single cell source is a promising low-risk approach enabling the prenatal fabrication of heart valves ready to use at birth. These living replacements with the potential of growth, remodeling, and regeneration may realize the early repair of congenital malformations.","Circulation","17846327",2007,"United States"
"Protein precoating of elastomeric tissue-engineering scaffolds increased cellularity, enhanced extracellular matrix protein production, and differentially regulated the phenotypes of circulating endothelial progenitor cells.","BACKGROUND: Optimal cell sources and scaffold-cell interactions remain unanswered questions for tissue engineering of heart valves. We assessed the effect of different protein precoatings on a single scaffold type (elastomeric poly (glycerol sebacate)) with a single cell source (endothelial progenitor cells).METHODS AND RESULTS: Elastomeric poly (glycerol sebacate) scaffolds were precoated with laminin, fibronectin, fibrin, collagen types I/III, or elastin. Characterized ovine peripheral blood endothelial progenitor cells were seeded onto scaffolds for 3 days followed by 14 days incubation. Endothelial progenitor cells were CD31+, vWF+, and alpha-SMA- before seeding confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Both precoated and uncoated scaffolds demonstrated surface expression of CD31+ and vWF+, alpha-SMA+ cells and were found in the &quot;interstitium&quot; of the scaffold. Protein precoating of elastomeric poly (glycerol sebacate) scaffolds revealed significantly increased cellularity and altered the phenotypes of endothelial progenitor cells, which resulted in changes in cellular behavior and extracellular matrix production. Moreover, mechanical flexure testing demonstrated decreased effective stiffness of the seeded scaffolds compared with unseeded controls.CONCLUSIONS: Scaffold precoating with extracellular matrix proteins can allow more precise &quot;engineering&quot; of cellular behavior in the development of tissue engineering of heart valves constructs by altering extracellular matrix production and cell phenotype.","Circulation","17846326",2007,"United States"
"A primary culture system for sustained expression of a calcium sensor in preserved adult rat ventricular myocytes.","For studying heart pathologies on the cellular level, cultured adult cardiac myocytes represent an important approach. We aimed to explore a novel adult rat ventricular myocyte culture system with minimised dedifferentiation allowing extended experimental manipulation of the cells such as expression of exogenous proteins. Various culture conditions were investigated including medium supplement, substrate coating and electrical pacing for one week. Adult myocytes were probed for (i) viability, (ii) morphology, (iii) frequency dependence of contractions, (iv) Ca(2+) transients, and (v) their tolerance towards adenovirus-mediated expression of the Ca(2+) sensor &quot;inverse pericam&quot;. Conventionally, in either serum supplemented or serum-free medium, myocytes dedifferentiated into flat cells within 3 days or cell physiology and morphology were impaired, respectively. In contrast, myocytes cultured in medium supplemented with an insulin-transferrin-selenite mixture on substrates coated with extracellular matrix proteins showed an increased cell attachment and a conserved cross-striation. Moreover, these myocytes displayed optimised preservation of their contractile behaviour and Ca(2+) signalling even under conditions of continuous electrical pacing. Sustained expression of inverse pericam did not alter myocyte function and allowed long lasting high speed Ca(2+) imaging of electrically driven adult myocytes. Our single-cell model thus provides a new advance for high-content screening of these highly specialised cells.","Cell calcium","17822759",2007,"Netherlands"
"Therapeutic potential of adult progenitor cells in cardiovascular disease.","Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for high morbidity/mortality rates worldwide. Advances in patient care have significantly reduced deaths from acute myocardial infarction. However, the cardiac remodeling processes induced after ischaemia are responsible for a worsening in the heart condition, which in many cases ends up in failure. In the last decade, a novel therapy based on stem cell transplantation is being intensively studied in animal models and some stem cell types (i.e., skeletal myoblasts and bone marrow-derived cells) are already being tested in clinical trials. A novel stem cell population isolated from the bone marrow, termed multipotent adult progenitor cells was characterised a few years ago by its ability to differentiate, at the single cell level, towards cells derived from the three embryonic germ layers. Later on, other pluripotent cell populations have been also derived from the bone marrow. In this overview, the authors outline different stem cell sources that have been tested for their cardiovascular potential and put the regenerative potential of multipotent adult progenitor cells in animal models of acute and chronic myocardial infarction into perspective.","Expert opinion on biological therapy","17696815",2007,"England"
"Bone marrow derived cells are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload.","BACKGROUND: Bone marrow (BM) cells possess broad differentiation potential and can form various cell lineages in response to pathophysiological cues. The present study investigated whether BM-derived cells contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, as well as the possible cellular mechanisms involved in such a role.METHODS AND RESULTS: Lethally irradiated wild-type mice were transplanted with BM cells from enhanced green fluorescent protein-transgenic mice. The chimeric mice were subjected to either prolonged hypoxia or transverse aortic constriction. BM-derived enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing cardiomyocytes increased in number over time, emerging predominantly in the pressure-overloaded ventricular myocardium, although they constituted &lt;0.01% of recipient cardiomyocytes. To determine whether BM-derived cardiomyocytes were derived from cell fusion or transdifferentiation at the single-cell level, lethally irradiated Cre mice were transplanted with BM cells from the double-conditional Cre reporter mouse line Z/EG. BM-derived cardiomyocytes were shown to arise from both cell fusion and transdifferentiation. Interestingly, BM-derived myofibroblasts expressing both vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were concentrated in the perivascular fibrotic area. These cells initially expressed MAC-1/CD14 but lost expression of these markers during the chronic phase, which suggests that they were derived from monocytes. A similar phenomenon occurred in cultured human monocytes, most of which ultimately expressed vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin.CONCLUSIONS: We found that BM-derived cells were involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy via the dual mechanisms of cell fusion and transdifferentiation. Moreover, the present results suggest that BM-derived monocytes accumulating in the perivascular space might play an important role in the formation of perivascular fibrosis via direct differentiation into myofibroblasts.","Circulation","17698734",2007,"United States"
"Transient early embryonic expression of Nkx2-5 mutations linked to congenital heart defects in human causes heart defects in Xenopus laevis.","Nkx2-5 is a homeobox containing transcription factor that is conserved and expressed in organisms that form hearts. Fruit flies lacking the gene (tinman) fail to form a dorsal vessel, mice that are homozygous null for Nkx2-5 form small, deformed hearts, and several human cardiac defects have been linked to dominant mutations in the Nkx2-5 gene. The Xenopus homologs (XNkx2-5) of two truncated forms of Nkx2-5 that have been identified in humans with congenital heart defects were used in the studies reported here. mRNAs encoding these mutations were injected into single cell Xenopus embryos, and heart development was monitored. Our results indicate that the introduction of truncated XNkx2-5 variants leads to three principle developmental defects. The atrial septum and the valve of the atrioventricular canal were both abnormal. In addition, video microscopic timing of heart contraction indicated that embryos injected with either mutant form of XNkx2-5 have conduction defects.","Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","17685485",2007,"United States"
"Endothelial-dependent mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment to the vascular wall.","Inflammation is a fundamental process that protects organisms by removing or neutralizing injurious agents. A key event in the inflammatory response is the localized recruitment of various leukocyte subsets. Here we address the cellular and regulatory mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment to the vessel wall in cardiovascular disease and discuss our evolving understanding of the role of the vascular endothelium in this process. The vascular endothelium is the continuous single-cell lining of the cardiovascular system that forms a critical interface between the blood and its components on one side and the tissues and organs on the other. It is heterogeneous and has many synthetic and metabolic functions including secretion of platelet-derived growth factor, von Willebrand factor, prostacyclin, NO, endothelin-1, and chemokines and the expression of adhesion molecules. It also acts as a nonthrombogenic and selective permeable barrier. Endothelial cells also interact closely with the extracellular matrix and with adjacent cells including pericytes and smooth muscle cells within the vessel wall. A central question in vascular biology is the role of the endothelium in the initiation of inflammatory response, the extent of its &quot;molecular conversations&quot; with recruited leukocytes, and its influence on the extent and/or outcome of this response.","Circulation research","17673684",2007,"United States"
"External contamination in single cell mtDNA analysis.","BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in single hematopoietic cells, muscle fibers, oocytes, and from tiny amount of tumor tissues and degraded clinical specimens has been reported in many medical publications. External DNA contamination, notoriously difficult to avoid, threatens the integrity of such studies.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Employing a phylogenetic approach, we analyzed the geographic origins of mtDNA sequence anomalies observed during multiple studies of mtDNA sequence variation in a total of 7094 single hematopoietic cells. 40 events with irregular mtDNA patterns were detected: eight instances (from seven different haplotypes) could be traced to laboratory personnel; six cases were caused by sample cross-contamination. The sources of the remaining events could not be identified, and the anomalous sequence variation referred to matrilines from East Asia, Africa, or West Eurasia, respectively. These mtDNA sequence anomalies could be best explained by contamination.CONCLUSIONS: Using the known world mtDNA phylogeny, we could distinguish the geographic origin of the anomalous mtDNA types, providing some useful information regarding the source of contamination. Our data suggest that routine mtDNA sequence analysis of laboratory personnel is insufficient to identify and eliminate all contaminants. A rate of 0.6% of external contamination in this study, while low, is not negligible: Unrecognized contaminants will be mistaken as evidence of remarkable somatic mutations associated with the development of cancer and other diseases. The effective contamination rate can increase by a factor of more than an order of magnitude in some studies that did not institute high standards. Our results are of particular relevance to mtDNA research in medicine, and such an approach should be adopted to maintain and improve quality control in single-cell analyses.","PloS one","17668059",2007,"United States"
"Mitochondrial DNA sequence heterogeneity of single CD34+ cells after nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","We applied a single-cell method to detect mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to evaluate the reconstitution of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and committed progenitor cells after nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation in humans. In a total of 1,958 single CD34(+) cells from six human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor and recipient pairs, individual CD34(+) clones were recognized based on the observed donor- or recipient-specific mtDNA sequence somatic alteration. There was no overall reduction of mtDNA heterogeneity among CD34(+) cells from the recipient after transplantation. Samples collected from two donors over time showed the persistence of certain CD34(+) clones marked by specific mutations. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing donor and recipient individual CD34(+) clones based on mtDNA mutations during engraftment. HSCs were not limited in number, and similar mtDNA heterogeneity levels suggested representation of the total stem cell compartment during rapid hematopoietic reconstitution in the recipient. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","17628021",2007,"United States"
"Determination of cell types and numbers during cardiac development in the neonatal and adult rat and mouse.","Cardiac fibroblasts, myocytes, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells are the major cellular constituents of the heart. The aim of this study was to observe alterations in myocardial cell populations during early neonatal development in the adult animal and to observe any variations of the cardiac cell populations in different species, specifically, the rat and mouse. Whole hearts were isolated from either mice or rats during the neonatal and adult stages of development, and single cell suspensions were prepared via sequential collagenase digestion. Heterogeneous cell populations were immunolabeled for specific cell types and analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In addition, the left ventricle, right ventricle, and septa were isolated, fixed, and sectioned for morphometric analyses. These same cardiac regions were also analyzed using FACS. We observed that the adult murine myocardium is composed of approximately 56% myocytes, 27% fibroblasts, 7% endothelial cells, and 10% vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, our morphometric and FACS data demonstrated similar percentages in the three regions examined. During murine neonatal cardiac development, we observed a marked increase in numbers of cardiac fibroblasts and a resultant decrease in percentages of myocytes in late neonatal development (day 15). Finally, FACS analyses of the rat heart during development displayed similar results in relation to increases in cardiac fibroblasts during development; however, cell populations in the rat differed markedly from those observed in the mouse. Taken together, these data enabled us to establish a homeostatic model for the myocardium that can be compared with genetic and cardiac disease models.","American journal of physiology.

"New insights into the regulation of cAMP synthesis beyond GPCR/G protein activation: implications in cardiovascular regulation.","Regulation of intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP is one of the most ubiquitous mechanisms for regulating cellular functions. Further, the manner in which cAMP production is regulated via G proteins at the level of adenylyl cyclase activation has been studied extensively. This review focuses instead on the recently identified mechanisms and roles for regulation of adenylyl cyclase functions beyond G protein activation. These mechanisms include: a) the coupling of particular isoforms of adenylyl cyclase to function within a single cell type b) regulation of membrane trafficking of higher order enzyme aggregates and c) raf kinase-dependent phosphorylation and sensitization of adenylyl cyclases--an important pathway for crosstalk between tyrosine kinase signaling cascades with regulation of cAMP-mediated responses.","Life sciences","17604058",2007,"Netherlands"
"Characterizing the contribution of voltage- and calcium-dependent coupling to action potential stability: implications for repolarization alternans.","Experiments have provided suggestive but inconclusive insights into the relative contributions of transmembrane voltage and intracellular calcium handling to the development of cardiac electrical instabilities such as repolarization alternans. In this study, we applied a novel combination of techniques (action potential voltage clamping, calcium-transient clamping, and stability analysis) to cardiac cell models to more clearly determine the roles that voltage- and calcium-dependent coupling play in regulating action potential stability and the development of alternans subsequent to the loss of stability. Using these techniques, we are able to demonstrate that voltage- and calcium-dependent coupling exhibit varying degrees of influence on action potential stability across models. Our results indicate that cellular dynamic instabilities such as alternans may be initiated by either voltage- or calcium-dependent mechanisms or by some combination of the two. Based on these modeling results, we propose novel single-cell experiments that incorporate action-potential voltage clamping, calcium imaging, and real-time measurement of action potential stability. These experiments will make it possible to experimentally determine the relative contribution of voltage coupling to the regulation of action potential stability in real cardiac myocytes, thereby providing further insights into the mechanism of alternans.","American journal of physiology.

"Characterization of cell motility in single heart valve interstitial cells in vitro.","Valve interstitial cells (VIC) are the most prevalent cells in the heart valve, regulating to a large extent the normal biology of the valve and its pathobiological response to disease. In the process of valve tissue repair by VICs, single cell motility is likely to be important, as it is in wound repair by most mesenchymal type cells. We designed in vitro experiments using low density monolayer cultures to study the association of morphology and motility in single VICs which expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin. We observed that the morphology of single VICs can be categorized into six types which are reminiscent of the shape of VICs seen in vivo during valve repair. Of these morphologies, round, rhomboid, tailed and spindled shaped VICs were the most common. VICs did change their morphology over time. Rhomboid cells could become tailed or spindle-shaped and vice versa. Using time-lapse imaging and immunofluorescent microscopy, we showed that VIC morphologies reflect differences in cell motility and cell-matrix interactions. Tailed and spindle-shaped VICs were the predominant motile types and were associated with few extracellular fibronectin fibrils and less focal adhesions, as demonstrated by vinculin staining. Round and rhomboid shaped VICs were less motile and were associated with prominent vinculin and extracellular fibronectin fibrils. We found that cell mitosis is an important determinant of VIC migration. Many of the motile VICs were associated with mitosis as the daughter cells separated by migrating as tailed and spindle shaped cells. Thus cell morphology is an important determinant of VIC motility.","Histology and histopathology","17503344",2007,"Spain"
"Clonally amplified cardiac stem cells are regulated by Sca-1 signaling for efficient cardiovascular regeneration.","Recent studies have shown that cardiac stem cells (CSCs) from the adult mammalian heart can give rise to functional cardiomyocytes; however, the definite surface markers to identify a definitive single entity of CSCs and the molecular mechanisms regulating their growth are so far unknown. Here, we demonstrate a single-cell deposition analysis to isolate individually selected CSCs from adult murine hearts and investigate the signals required for their proliferation and survival. Clonally proliferated CSCs express stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) with embryonic stem (ES) cell-like and mesenchymal cell-like characteristics and are associated with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Using a transgene that expresses a GFP reporter under the control of the TERT promoter, we demonstrated that TERT(GFP)-positive fractions from the heart were enriched for cells expressing Sca-1. Knockdown of Sca-1 transcripts in CSCs led to retarded ex vivo expansion and apoptosis through Akt inactivation. We also show that ongoing CSC proliferation and survival after direct cell-grafting into ischemic myocardium require Sca-1 to upregulate the secreted paracrine effectors that augment neoangiogenesis and limit cardiac apoptosis. Thus, Sca-1 might be an essential component to promote CSC proliferation and survival to directly facilitate early engraftment, and might indirectly exert the effects on late cardiovascular differentiation after CSC transplantation.","Journal of cell science","17502484",2007,"England"
"Pluripotent stem cells exhibiting similar characteristics can be isolated from human fetal bone marrow, heart, liver, muscle, lung, derma, kidney, and fat.","Previously, we reported that a cell population derived from human fetal bone marrow (BM), termed here Flk1(+)CD34(-) postembryonic pluripotent stem cells (PPSCs) that have the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), could differentiate into ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal cell types at the single cell level in vitro, and that these cells could also differentiate into the epithelium of liver, lung, gut, as well as the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages after transplantion into irradiated non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. In this study, we further isolated pluripotent stem cells from human fetal heart, liver, muscle, lung, derma, kidney, and fat and then analyzed the characteristics and function of these stem cells. It was found that the phenotype of the culture-expanded pluripotent stem cells from different fetal tissues was similar to BM-derived Flk1(+)CD34(-) PPSCs, i.e. Flk1 and CD44 positive, GlyA, CD34, CD45, class I-HLA and HLA-DR negative. Morphologically, these cells were fibroblast-like and the doubling time was about 30 h. More importantly, culture-expanded pluripotent stem cells from all these fetal tissues were able to differentiate into cells with morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of adipocytes, osteocytes, neurons, glial cells and hepatocytes. These pluripotent stem cells with characteristics similar to fetal BM-derived Flk1(+)CD34(-) PPSCs can be selected and cultured from tissues other than the BM. This phenomenon may help explain the &quot;stem cell plasticity&quot; found in multiple human tissues. In addition, as fetal BM-derived Flk1 + CD34(-) PPSCs, these pluripotent stem cells from different fetal tissues had the capacity for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation even after being expanded for more than 40 population doublings in vitro. Thus, they may be an ideal source of stem cells for treatment of inherited or degenerative diseases. ","Frontiers of medicine in China","24557674",2007,"China"
"Localization of an NH(2)-terminal disease-causing mutation hot spot to the &quot;clamp&quot; region in the three-dimensional structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor.","A region between residues 414 and 466 in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) harbors more than half of the known NH(2)-terminal mutations associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. To gain insight into the structural basis of this NH(2)-terminal mutation hot spot, we have determined its location in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2. Green fluorescent protein (GFP), used as a structural marker, was inserted into the middle of this mutation hot spot after Ser-437 in the RyR2 sequence. The resultant GFP-RyR2 fusion protein, RyR2(S437-GFP,) was expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized using Ca(2+) release, [(3)H]ryanodine binding, and single cell Ca(2+) imaging studies. These functional analyses revealed that RyR2(S437-GFP) forms a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channel that possesses Ca(2+) and caffeine dependence of activation indistinguishable from that of wild type (wt) RyR2. HEK293 cells expressing RyR2(S437-GFP) displayed a propensity for store overload-induced Ca(2+) release similar to that in cells expressing RyR2-wt. The three-dimensional structure of the purified RyR2(S437-GFP) was reconstructed using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle image processing. Subtraction of the three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR2-wt and RyR2(S437-GFP) revealed the location of the inserted GFP, and hence the NH(2)-terminal mutation hot spot, in a region between domains 5 and 9 in the clamp-shaped structure. This location is close to a previously mapped central disease-causing mutation site located in a region between domains 5 and 6. These results, together with findings from previous studies, suggest that the proposed interactions between the NH(2)-terminal and central regions of RyR2 are likely to take place between domains 5 and 6 and that the clamp-shaped structure, which shows substantial conformational differences between the closed and open states, is highly susceptible to disease-causing mutations.","The Journal of biological chemistry","17452324",2007,"United States"
"Identification and selection of cardiomyocytes during human embryonic stem cell differentiation.","Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are pluripotent lines that can differentiate in vitro into cell derivatives of all three germ layers, including cardiomyocytes. Successful application of these unique cells in the areas of cardiovascular research and regenerative medicine has been hampered by difficulties in identifying and selecting specific cardiac progenitor cells from the mixed population of differentiating cells. We report the generation of stable transgenic hESC lines, using lentiviral vectors, and single-cell clones that express a reporter gene (eGFP) under the transcriptional control of a cardiac-specific promoter (the human myosin light chain-2V promoter). Our results demonstrate the appearance of eGFP-expressing cells during the differentiation of the hESC as embryoid bodies (EBs) that can be identified and sorted using FACS (purity&gt;95%, viability&gt;85%). The eGFP-expressing cells were stained positively for cardiac-specific proteins (&gt;93%), expressed cardiac-specific genes, displayed cardiac-specific action-potentials, and could form stable myocardial cell grafts following in vivo cell transplantation. The generation of these transgenic hESC lines may be used to identify and study early cardiac precursors for developmental studies, to robustly quantify the extent of cardiomyocyte differentiation, to label the cells for in vivo grafting, and to allow derivation of purified cell populations of cardiomyocytes for future myocardial cell therapy strategies.","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","17435178",2007,"United States"
"Mechanism underlying initiation of paroxysmal atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation by ectopic foci: a simulation study.","BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying paroxysmal atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation initiation by ectopic foci from various locations are unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: We used parallel computational techniques to study an anatomically accurate 3-dimensional atrial structure incorporating a detailed ionic-current model of an atrial myocyte. At the single-cell level, upregulation of the L-type Ca2+ current I(Ca,L) steepened restitution curves of action potential duration and conduction velocity compared with the control. Spontaneous firings of ectopic foci, coupled with sinus activity, produced dynamic spatial dispersions of repolarization, including discordant alternans, which caused conduction block and reentry only for the elevated I(Ca,L) case. For each foci location, a vulnerable window for atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation induction was identified as a function of the coupling interval and focus cycle length. For ectopic foci in the pulmonary veins and left atrium, the site of conduction block and reentry gradually shifted, as a function of coupling interval, from the right atrium to the interatrial area and finally to the left atrium. The size of the vulnerable window was largest for pulmonary vein foci, becoming markedly smaller for right atrial foci, especially those near the sinoatrial node.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a mechanism of dynamically induced repolarization dispersion, especially discordant alternans, underlies the induction of atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation by atrial ectopic foci. The sites and likelihood of reentry induction varied according to ectopic focus location and timing, with the largest vulnerable window corresponding to the pulmonary vein region.","Circulation","17420354",2007,"United States"
"Carbon fiber technique for the investigation of single-cell mechanics in intact cardiac myocytes.","This protocol describes a method for attaching single isolated cardiac myocytes to carbon fibers for mechanical manipulation and measurement. This method relies on cell-adhesive carbon fibers that attach easily to the cell membrane without causing damage, and is thus applicable to intact myocytes. To connect the carbon fiber to micromanipulators, a fiber holder with glass capillaries must first be fabricated. After connection of the fibers to the micromanipulators, firm attachment is easily established by gently pressing the fiber tip onto the cell membrane. Unlike other methods, this technique does not require vast technical expertise, and therefore greatly facilitates experiments. This method enables detection of the effect of drugs, genetic defects or the expression of exogenous proteins on both active and passive properties of cardiac myocytes. In combination with other experimental procedures, this technique can also be applied to the study of mechano-transduction. This protocol can be completed in 3.5 h.","Nature protocols","17406434",2007,"England"
"Dynamic relationship between IFN-gamma and IL-2 profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T cells and antigen load.","Distinct IFN-gamma and IL-2 profiles of Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells have recently been associated with different clinical disease states and Ag loads in viral infections. We assessed the kinetics and functional profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag-specific T cells secreting IFN-gamma and IL-2 in 23 patients with untreated active tuberculosis when bacterial and Ag loads are high and after curative treatment, when Ag load is reduced. The frequencies of M. tuberculosis Ag-specific IFN-gamma-secreting T cells declined during 28 mo of follow-up with an average percentage decline of 5.8% per year (p = 0.005), while the frequencies of Ag-specific IL-2-secreting T cells increased during treatment (p = 0.02). These contrasting dynamics for the two cytokines led to a progressive convergence of the frequencies of IFN-gamma- and IL-2-secreting cells over 28 mo. Simultaneous measurement of IFN-gamma and IL-2 secretion at the single-cell level revealed a codominance of IFN-gamma-only secreting and IFN-gamma/IL-2 dual secreting CD4(+) T cells in active disease that shifted to dominance of IFN-gamma/IL-2-secreting CD4(+) T cells and newly detectable IL-2-only secreting CD4(+) T cells during and after treatment. These distinct T cell functional signatures before and after treatment suggest a novel immunological marker of mycobacterial load and clinical status in tuberculosis that now requires validation in larger prospective studies.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","17404305",2007,"United Kingdom"
"A model of smooth muscle cell synchronization in the arterial wall.","Vasomotion is a rhythmic variation in microvascular diameter. Although known for more than 150 years, the cellular processes underlying the initiation of vasomotion are not fully understood. In the present study a model of a single cell is extended by coupling a number of cells into a tube. The simulated results point to a permissive role of cGMP in establishing intercellular synchronization. In sufficient concentration, cGMP may activate a cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel, causing a tight spatiotemporal coupling between release of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium, membrane depolarization, and influx of extracellular calcium. Low [cGMP] is associated only with unsynchronized waves. At intermediate concentrations, cells display either waves or whole cell oscillations, but these remain unsynchronized between cells. Whole cell oscillations are associated with rhythmic variation in membrane potential and flow of current through gap junctions. The amplitude of these oscillations in potential grows with increasing [cGMP], and, past a certain threshold, they become strong enough to entrain all cells in the vascular wall, thereby initiating sustained vasomotion. In this state there is a rhythmic flow of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels into the cytoplasm, making the frequency of established vasomotion sensitive to membrane potential. It is concluded that electrical coupling through gap junctions is likely to be responsible for the rapid synchronization across a large number of cells. Gap-junctional current between cells is due to the appearance of oscillations in the membrane potential that again depends on the entrainment of sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane within the individual cell.","American journal of physiology.

"Increased expression of CCR5 in experimental autoimmune myocarditis and reduced severity induced by anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody.","Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. CCR5, which is expressed mostly on activated T cells and monocytes/macrophages, are potent chemotactic factors for autoimmune myocarditis. We investigated the role of CCR5 in the formation of experimental autoimmune myocarditis. Expression of CCR5 and its cognate ligands was assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Single-cell suspension of splenocytes and whole blood specimens from EAM mice were subjected to flow-cytometry analysis. We investigated the critical role of CCR5 in EAM mice by adoptively transferring CCR5-positive/negative T cells to mice and by neutralizing CCR5 with monoclonal antibody to observe the influence on the severity and prevalence of myocarditis. In this report, we found that CCR5-positive cells predominate in infiltrated inflammatory cells in cardiac tissue of EAM mice and CCR5-positive T cells in peripheral blood increased markedly in EAM mice compared with controls. Moreover, we demonstrated that the severity of myocarditis was significantly reduced when CCR5-negative T cells from EAM mice were adoptively transferred. When administrated with CCR5-positive T cells, the myocarditis was significantly aggravated. We also demonstrated that blockade of CCR5 with monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced severity of myocarditis in EAM mice. Overall, these findings indicate that CCR5 is important in the induction of EAM and inhibition of CCR5 with monoclonal antibody significantly reduces the severity of myocarditis. CCR5 may have the potential to become a new therapy target against autoimmune myocarditis.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","17362985",2007,"England"
"Dependence of the community effect of cultured cardiomyocytes on the cell network pattern.","To elucidate the role of the community effect in cardiomyocytes, we developed an on-chip single-cell-based culture system with which the dynamics of the change of beat rate and beat rate fluctuation of cultured cardiomyocytes can be measured at the single-cell level before and after the formation of a cell network. We examined the dependence of the community effect on cell network pattern by culturing cardiomyocytes in differently shaped microchambers and investigated the relation between the network pattern and the stability of the beat rate. We found that beat rate fluctuation tends to decrease as cell-community size increases, irrespective of cell network pattern. This indicates that on-chip single-cell-based cardiomyocyte communities might be able to model a heart tissue accurately enough to be used in practical applications such as drug screening.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","17359936",2007,"United States"

Twenty Balb/c mice were distributed into four groups: control (non-infected animals); Trypanosoma cruzi infected; T. cruzi infected and submitted to benznidazole therapy; and only treated with benznidazole. The results obtained with the single cell gel (comet) assay showed that T. cruzi was able induce DNA damage in heart cells of both benznidazole treated or untreated infected mice. Similarly, T. cruzi infected animals showed an increase of DNA lesions in spleen cells. Regarding nitric oxide synthesis, statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were observed in all experimental groups compared to negative control, the strongest effect observed in the T. cruzi infected group. Taken together, these results indicate that T. cruzi may increase the level of DNA damage in mice heart and spleen cells. Probably, nitric oxide plays an important role in DNA damaging whereas benznidazole was able to minimize induced T. cruzi genotoxic effects in spleen cells.","Experimental parasitology","17286971",2007,"United States"

"Regulators of G protein signalling: a spotlight on emerging functions in the cardiovascular system.","Regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins are GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, and are therefore physiologically and pathophysiologically important negative regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor signalling in the cardiovascular system. Owing to the functional redundancy of many of the 20 RGS, and more than 20 RGS-like, proteins even within a single cell, animal models shedding light on the functions of individual RGS proteins are often missing. Nevertheless, RGS2 is a member of this protein family, for which specific functions in the vasculature and the heart are now emerging. Recent data show that the 519-amino acid RGS3, the only RGS protein with an additional G protein betagamma dimer binding domain, largely alters the signalling of G(i) proteins to the monomeric GTPases Rac1 and RhoA in cardiomyocytes. In addition, an alternative approach using transgenic animals expressing RGS-resistant G protein alpha subunits now highlights the contributions of RGS proteins to distinct signalling pathways in the heart.","Current opinion in pharmacology","17276730",2007,"England"

"Increased lymphocyte deoxyribonucleic acid damage in patients with cardiac syndrome X.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether there is lymphocyte deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in patients with cardiac syndrome X (CSX), and its relation with total antioxidant status (TAS), inflammation and ischemia.METHODS: Twenty-three patients with CSX, 21 patients with non-CSX (NCSX) and 20 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Lymphocyte DNA damage (Arbitrary Unit) was assessed by alkaline single cell electrophoresis (comet) assay in peripheral lymphocyte, and plasma levels of TAS (mmol Trolox equiv./l) were determined using a novel automated measurement method. High sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and other biochemical parameters were measured from all subjects.

Also, TAS was decreased, and hsCRP was increased in CSX compared with NCSX and control group (p&lt;0.001, for all).

In multiple linear regression analysis, lymphocyte DNA damage was correlated with only TAS (beta=-0.413, p=0.017) and hsCRP (beta=0.414, p=0.006).CONCLUSION: Lymphocyte DNA damage was increased in patients with CSX. The increase in lymphocyte DNA damage may be related with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with CSX.","Mutation research","17261316",2007,"Netherlands"
"Single-cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing Csx/Nkx2.5 and GATA4 undergo the stochastic cardiomyogenic fate and behave like transient amplifying cells.","Bone marrow-derived stromal cells can give rise to cardiomyocytes as well as adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro. The existence of mesenchymal stem cells has been proposed, but it remains unclear if a single-cell-derived stem cell stochastically commits toward a cardiac lineage. By single-cell marking, we performed a follow-up study of individual cells during the differentiation of 9-15c mesenchymal stromal cells derived from bone marrow cells. Three types of cells, i.e., cardiac myoblasts, cardiac progenitors and multipotent stem cells were differentiated from a single cell, implying that cardiomyocytes are generated stochastically from a single-cell-derived stem cell. We also demonstrated that overexpression of Csx/Nkx2.5 and GATA4, precardiac mesodermal transcription factors, enhanced cardiomyogenic differentiation of 9-15c cells, and the frequency of cardiomyogenic differentiation was increased by co-culturing with fetal cardiomyocytes. Single-cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing Csx/Nkx2.5 and GATA4 behaved like cardiac transient amplifying cells, and still retained their plasticity in vivo.","Experimental cell research","17208226",2007,"United States"
"Inferring the cellular origin of voltage and calcium alternans from the spatial scales of phase reversal during discordant alternans.","Beat-to-beat alternation of the action potential duration (APD) in paced cardiac cells has been linked to the onset of lethal arrhythmias. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that alternans at the single cell level can be caused by unstable membrane voltage (V(m)) dynamics linked to steep APD-restitution, or unstable intracellular calcium (Ca) cycling linked to high sensitivity of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load. Identifying which of these two mechanisms is the primary cause of cellular alternans, however, has remained difficult since Ca and V(m) are bidirectionally coupled. Here, we use numerical simulations of a physiologically detailed ionic model to show that the origin of alternans can be inferred by measuring the length scales over which APD and Ca(i) alternans reverse phase during spatially discordant alternans. The main conclusion is that these scales are comparable to a few millimeters and equal when alternans is driven by APD restitution, but differ markedly when alternans is driven predominantly by unstable Ca cycling. In the latter case, APD alternans still reverses phase on a millimeter tissue scale due to electrotonic coupling, while Ca alternans reverses phase on a submillimeter cellular scale. These results show that experimentally accessible measurements of Ca(i) and V(m) in cardiac tissue can be used to shed light on the cellular origin of alternans.","Biophysical journal","17172300",2006,"United States"
"Direct aldosterone action on mouse cardiomyocytes detected with atomic force microscopy.","There is growing evidence that aldosterone acts on heart where it causes cellular remodeling and hypertrophy. Since it is still unclear whether aldosterone directly acts on cardiomyocytes or indirectly, by an altered electrolyte balance in the organism, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) in primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes to measure hormone-induced changes in cell volume and plasma membrane surface. AFM measures cell volume and, at the same time, provides quantitative information on cell surface properties. Neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were cultured for 28 hours in absence or presence of 100 nM aldosterone. Spironolactone was applied as a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist. At the microscopic level, single cell volume and single cell surface were found unchanged by aldosterone. However, nanoscopy of the cell surface, i.e. analysis of the plasma membrane at the nanometer level, revealed a specific increase in plasma membrane nano-enfoldings (roughness). This aldosterone-mediated increase in cell surface roughness was completely prevented by spironolactone. We conclude: (i) Aldosterone directly acts upon cardiomyocytes. (ii) At the microscopic level, no changes of cell volume and cell surface are detectable. (iii) At the nanoscopic level, aldosterone increases plasma membrane roughness. These nanometer changes, detectable only with AFM in cells scanned in fluid after fixation under physiological conditions, indicate plasma membrane remodeling of cardiomyocytes by mineralocorticoids.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","17167231",2006,"Germany"
"Laser microdissection and capture of pure cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts from infarcted heart regions: perceived hyperoxia induces p21 in peri-infarct myocytes.","Myocardial infarction caused by ischemia-reperfusion in the coronary vasculature is a focal event characterized by an infarct-core, bordering peri-infarct zone and remote noninfarct zone. Recently, we have reported the first technique, based on laser microdissection pressure catapulting (LMPC), enabling the dissection of infarction-induced biological responses in multicellular regions of the heart. Molecular mechanisms in play at the peri-infarct zone are central to myocardial healing. At the infarct site, myocytes are more sensitive to insult than robust fibroblasts. Understanding of cell-specific responses in the said zones is therefore critical. In this work, we describe the first technique to collect the myocardial tissue with a single-cell resolution. The infarcted myocardium was identified by using a truncated hematoxylin-eosin stain. Cell elements from the infarct, peri-infarct, and noninfarct zones were collected in a chaotropic RNA lysis solution with micron-level surgical precision. Isolated RNA was analyzed for quality by employing microfluidics technology and reverse transcribed to generate cDNA. Purity of the collected specimen was established by real-time PCR analyses of cell-specific genes. Previously, we have reported that the oxygen-sensitive induction of p21/Cip1/Waf1/Sdi1 in cardiac fibroblasts in the peri-infarct zone plays a vital role in myocardial remodeling. Using the novel LMPC technique developed herein, we confirmed that finding and report for the first time that the induction of p21 in the peri-infarct zone is not limited to fibroblasts but is also evident in myocytes. This work presents the first account of an analytical technique that applies the LMPC technology to study myocardial remodeling with a cell-type specific resolution.","American journal of physiology.

"Molecular and pharmacological properties of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.","Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be coaxed to differentiate into specific cell types, including cardiomyocyte-like cells. These cells express cardiac-specific markers and display functional similarities to their adult counterparts. Based on these properties, hESC-derived cardiomyocytes have the potential to be extremely useful in various in vitro applications and to provide the opportunity for cardiac cell replacement therapies. However, before this can become a reality, the molecular and functional characteristics of these cells need to be investigated in more detail. In the present study we differentiate hESCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells via embryoid bodies (EBs). The fraction of spontaneously beating clusters obtained from the EBs averaged approximately 30% of the total number of EBs used. These cell clusters were isolated, dissociated into single-cell suspensions, and frozen for long-term storage. The cryopreserved cells could be successfully thawed and subcultured. Using electron microscopy, we observed Z discs and tight junctions in the hESC-derived cardiomyocytes, and by immunohistochemical analysis we detected expression of cardiac-specific markers (cTnI and cMHC). Notably, using BrdU labeling we also could demonstrate that some of the hESC-derived cardiomyocytes retain a proliferative capacity. Furthermore, pharmacological stimulation of the cells resulted in responses indicative of functional adrenergic and muscarinic receptor coupling systems. Taken together, these results lend support to the notion that hESCs can be used as a source for the procurement of cardiomyocytes for in vitro and in vivo applications.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","17138763",2006,"England"
"Multipotent embryonic isl1+ progenitor cells lead to cardiac, smooth muscle, and endothelial cell diversification.","Cardiogenesis requires the generation of endothelial, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, thought to arise from distinct embryonic precursors. We use genetic fate-mapping studies to document that isl1(+) precursors from the second heart field can generate each of these diverse cardiovascular cell types in vivo. Utilizing embryonic stem (ES) cells, we clonally amplified a cellular hierarchy of isl1(+) cardiovascular progenitors, which resemble the developmental precursors in the embryonic heart. The transcriptional signature of isl1(+)/Nkx2.5(+)/flk1(+) defines a multipotent cardiovascular progenitor, which can give rise to cells of all three lineages. These studies document a developmental paradigm for cardiogenesis, where muscle and endothelial lineage diversification arises from a single cell-level decision of a multipotent isl1(+) cardiovascular progenitor cell (MICP). The discovery of ES cell-derived MICPs suggests a strategy for cardiovascular tissue regeneration via their isolation, renewal, and directed differentiation into specific mature cardiac, pacemaker, smooth muscle, and endothelial cell types.","Cell","17123592",2006,"United States"
"Developmental origin of a bipotential myocardial and smooth muscle cell precursor in the mammalian heart.","Despite recent advances in delineating the mechanisms involved in cardiogenesis, cellular lineage specification remains incompletely understood. To explore the relationship between developmental fate and potential, we isolated a cardiac-specific Nkx2.5(+) cell population from the developing mouse embryo. The majority of these cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes and conduction system cells. Some, surprisingly, adopted a smooth muscle fate. To address the clonal origin of these lineages, we isolated Nkx2.5(+) cells from in vitro differentiated murine embryonic stem cells and found approximately 28% of these cells expressed c-kit. These c-kit(+) cells possessed the capacity for long-term in vitro expansion and differentiation into both cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells from a single cell. We confirmed these findings by isolating c-kit(+)Nkx2.5(+) cells from mouse embryos and demonstrated their capacity for bipotential differentiation in vivo. Taken together, these results support the existence of a common precursor for cardiovascular lineages in the mammalian heart.","Cell","17123591",2006,"United States"
"Cell model for efficient simulation of wave propagation in human ventricular tissue under normal and pathological conditions.","In this paper, we formulate a model for human ventricular cells that is efficient enough for whole organ arrhythmia simulations yet detailed enough to capture the effects of cell level processes such as current blocks and channelopathies. The model is obtained from our detailed human ventricular cell model by using mathematical techniques to reduce the number of variables from 19 to nine. We carefully compare our full and reduced model at the single cell, cable and 2D tissue level and show that the reduced model has a very similar behaviour. Importantly, the new model correctly produces the effects of current blocks and channelopathies on AP and spiral wave behaviour, processes at the core of current day arrhythmia research. The new model is well over four times more efficient than the full model. We conclude that the new model can be used for efficient simulations of the effects of current changes on arrhythmias in the human heart.","Physics in medicine and biology","17110776",2006,"England"
"Cytomics - importance of multimodal analysis of cell function and proliferation in oncology.","Cancer is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease involving a succession of genetic changes (frequently caused or accompanied by exogenous trauma), and resulting in a molecular phenotype that in turn results in a malignant specification. The development of malignancy has been described as a multistep process involving self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and finally tissue invasion and metastasis. The quantitative analysis of networking molecules within the cells might be applied to understand native-state tissue signalling biology, complex drug actions and dysfunctional signalling in transformed cells, that is, in cancer cells. High-content and high-throughput single-cell analysis can lead to systems biology and cytomics. The application of cytomics in cancer research and diagnostics is very broad, ranging from the better understanding of the tumour cell biology to the identification of residual tumour cells after treatment, to drug discovery. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint in detail these processes on the molecular, cellular and tissue level. A comprehensive knowledge of these will require tissue analysis, which is multiplex and functional; thus, vast amounts of data are being collected from current genomic and proteomic platforms for integration and interpretation as well as for new varieties of updated cytomics technology. This overview will briefly highlight the most important aspects of this continuously developing field.","Cell proliferation","17109634",2006,"England"
"Identification of two types of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in rat ventricular myocytes.","The ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels are known to provide a functional linkage between the electrical activity of the cell membrane and metabolism. Two types of inwardly rectifying K(+) channel subunits (i.e., Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) with which sulfonylurea receptors are associated were reported to constitute the K(ATP) channels. In this study, we provide evidence to show two types of K(ATP) channels with different biophysical properties functionally expressed in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. Using patch-clamp technique, we found that single-channel conductance for the different two types of K(ATP) channels in these cells was 57 and 21 pS. The kinetic properties, including mean open time and bursting kinetics, did not differ between these two types of K(ATP) channels. Diazoxide only activated the small-conductance K(ATP) channel, while pinacidil and dinitrophenol stimulated both channels. Both of these K(ATP) channels were sensitive to block by glibenclamide. Additionally, western blotting, immunochemistry, and RT-PCR revealed two types of Kir6.X channels, i.e., Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, in rat ventricular myocytes. Single-cell Ca(2+) imaging also revealed that similar to dinitrophenol, diazoxide reduced the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+). The present results suggest that these two types of K(ATP) channels may functionally be related to the activity of heart cells.","Life sciences","17097686",2006,"Netherlands"
"3'Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 is essential for ischemic preconditioning of the myocardium.","Brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion that precede sustained ischemia lead to a reduction in myocardial infarct size. This phenomenon, known as ischemic preconditioning, is mediated by signaling pathway(s) that are yet to be fully defined. 3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) has been implicated in numerous cellular processes. However, the involvement of PDK1 in preconditioning has yet to be elucidated. Studying PDK1 is not as straightforward as it is for the majority of kinases, due to the lack of a specific inhibitor of PDK1. Therefore, we have taken advantage of PDK1 hypomorphic mutant mice with reduced expression of PDK1 to study the role of PDK1 in preconditioning. Whole heart and single cell models of preconditioning demonstrated that the hearts and cardiac cells from PDK1 hypomorphic mice could not be preconditioned. The cardioprotective effect of PDK1 was not related to the effect that preconditioning has on sarcolemmal membrane action potential as revealed by di-8-ANEPPS, a sarcolemmal-potential sensitive dye, and laser confocal microscopy. In contrast, experiments with JC-1, a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye, has demonstrated that intact PDK1 levels were required for preconditioning-mediated regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blotting combined with functional experiments have shown that intact PDK1 levels were required for preconditioning-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and cardioprotection. We conclude that PDK1 mediates preconditioning in the heart by regulating activating PKB-GSK-3beta to regulate mitochondrial but not sarcolemmal membrane potential. 3'Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is essential for ischemic preconditioning of the myocardium.","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","17077284",2006,"United Kingdom"
"Role of the community effect of cardiomyocyte in the entrainment and reestablishment of stable beating rhythms.","To investigate the roles that the community effect and entrainment function of cultured cardiomyocyte play in decreasing beating fluctuation and reestablishing synchronized beating, we developed a single-cell-based two-dimensional network culture assay to measure and compare the dynamics of beating rhythm synchronization of individual cells before and after they form networks. Studying the formation of two-cell networks, we found that their synchronized beating tended to be determined by the cardiomyocyte whose beat rate fluctuated less than that of the other cardiomyocyte. We further found that the strength of this tendency increased with the number of cells in the network. These results indicate that (1) beating fluctuation is one of the important factors influencing the reestablishment of a stable synchronous beating rhythm, (2) the larger networks reduce fluctuation, and (3) the formation of a spatial network can itself stabilize cardiomyocyte beat rates.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","17055457",2006,"United States"
"Cyclic AMP imaging in adult cardiac myocytes reveals far-reaching beta1-adrenergic but locally confined beta2-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling.","Beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) are known to differentially regulate cardiomyocyte contraction and growth. We tested the hypothesis that these differences are attributable to spatial compartmentation of the second messenger cAMP. Using a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach, we directly monitored the spatial and temporal distribution of cAMP in adult cardiomyocytes. We developed a new cAMP-FRET sensor (termed HCN2-camps) based on a single cAMP binding domain of the hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2 (HCN2). Its cytosolic distribution, high dynamic range, and sensitivity make HCN2-camps particularly well suited to monitor subcellular localization of cardiomyocyte cAMP. We generated HCN2-camps transgenic mice and performed single-cell FRET imaging on freshly isolated cardiomyocytes. Whole-cell superfusion with isoproterenol showed a moderate elevation of cAMP. Application of various phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors revealed stringent control of cAMP through PDE4&gt;PDE2&gt;PDE3. The beta(1)AR-mediated cAMP signals were entirely dependent on PDE4 activity, whereas beta(2)AR-mediated cAMP was under control of multiple PDE isoforms. beta(1)AR subtype-specific stimulation yielded approximately 2-fold greater cAMP responses compared with selective beta(2)-subtype stimulation, even on treatment with the nonselective PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (DeltaFRET, 17.3+/-1.3% [beta(1)AR] versus 8.8+/-0.4% [beta(2)AR]). Treatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate G(i) did not affect cAMP production. Localized beta(1)AR stimulation generated a cAMP gradient propagating throughout the cell, whereas local beta(2)AR stimulation did not elicit marked cAMP diffusion. Our data reveal that in adult cardiac myocytes, beta(1)ARs induce far-reaching cAMP signals, whereas beta(2)AR-induced cAMP remains locally confined.","Circulation research","17038640",2006,"United States"
"In vivo MRI of cancer cell fate at the single-cell level in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis to the brain.","Metastasis (the spread of cancer from a primary tumor to secondary organs) is responsible for most cancer deaths. The ability to follow the fate of a population of tumor cells over time in an experimental animal would provide a powerful new way to monitor the metastatic process. Here we describe a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that permits the tracking of breast cancer cells in a mouse model of brain metastasis at the single-cell level. Cancer cells that were injected into the left ventricle of the mouse heart and then delivered to the brain were detectable on MR images. This allowed the visualization of the initial delivery and distribution of cells, as well as the growth of tumors from a subset of these cells within the whole intact brain volume. The ability to follow the metastatic process from the single-cell stage through metastatic growth, and to quantify and monitor the presence of solitary undivided cells will facilitate progress in understanding the mechanisms of brain metastasis and tumor dormancy, and the development of therapeutics to treat this disease.","Magnetic resonance in medicine","17029229",2006,"United States"
"M(1) and M(2) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes mediate Ca(2+) channel current inhibition in rat sympathetic stellate ganglion neurons.","Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are known to mediate the acetylcholine inhibition of Ca(2+) channels in central and peripheral neurons. Stellate ganglion (SG) neurons provide the main sympathetic input to the heart and contribute to the regulation of heart rate and myocardial contractility. Little information is available regarding mAChR regulation of Ca(2+) channels in SG neurons. The purpose of this study was to identify the mAChR subtypes that modulate Ca(2+) channel currents in rat SG neurons innervating heart muscle. Accordingly, the modulation of Ca(2+) channel currents by the muscarinic cholinergic agonist, oxotremorine-methiodide (Oxo-M), and mAChR blockers was examined. Oxo-M-mediated mAChR stimulation led to inhibition of Ca(2+) currents through voltage-dependent (VD) and voltage-independent (VI) pathways. Pre-exposure of SG neurons to the M(1) receptor blocker, M(1)-toxin, resulted in VD inhibition of Ca(2+) currents after Oxo-M application. On the other hand, VI modulation of Ca(2+) currents was observed after pretreatment of cells with methoctramine (M(2) mAChR blocker). The Oxo-M-mediated inhibition was nearly eliminated in the presence of both M(1) and M(2) mAChR blockers but was unaltered when SG neurons were exposed to the M(4) mAChR toxin, M(4)-toxin. Finally, the results from single-cell RT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays indicated that M(1) and M(2) receptors are expressed and located on the surface of SG neurons. Overall, the results indicate that SG neurons that innervate cardiac muscle express M(1) and M(2) mAChR, and activation of these receptors leads to inhibition of Ca(2+) channel currents through VI and VD pathways, respectively.","Journal of neurophysiology","17005606",2006,"United States"
"Effects of pacemaker currents on creation and modulation of human ventricular pacemaker: theoretical study with application to biological pacemaker engineering.","A cardiac biological pacemaker (BP) has been created by suppression of the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) or overexpression of the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)). We theoretically investigated the effects of incorporating I(h), T-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,T)), sustained inward current (I(st)), and/or low-voltage-activated L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,LD)) on 1) creation of BP cells, 2) robustness of BP activity to electrotonic loads of nonpacemaking (NP) cells, and 3) BP cell ability to drive NP cells. We used a single-cell model for human ventricular myocytes (HVMs) and also coupled-cell models composed of BP and NP cells. Bifurcation structures of the model cells were explored during changes in conductance of the currents and gap junction. Incorporating the pacemaker currents did not yield BP activity in HVM with normal I(K1) but increased the critical I(K1) conductance for BP activity to emerge. Expressing I(h) appeared to be most helpful in facilitating creation of BP cells via I(K1) suppression. In the coupled-cell model, I(st) significantly enlarged the gap conductance (G(C)) region where stable BP cell pacemaking and NP cell driving occur, reducing the number of BP cells required for robust pacemaking and driving. In contrast, I(h) enlarged the G(C) region of pacemaking and driving only when I(K1) of the NP cell was relatively low. I(Ca,T) or I(Ca,LD) exerted effects similar to those of I(st) but caused shrinkage or irregularity of BP oscillations. These findings suggest that expressing I(st) most effectively improves the structural stability of BPs to electrotonic loads and the BP ability to drive the ventricle.","American journal of physiology.

"Area postrema neurons are modulated by the adipocyte hormone adiponectin.","Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived peptide hormone involved in energy homeostasis and the pathogenesis of obesity, including hypertension. Area postrema (AP) lacks a blood-brain barrier and is a critical homeostatic integration center for humoral and neural signals. Here we investigate the role of AP in adiponectin signaling. We show that rat AP expresses AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 adiponectin receptor mRNA. We used current-clamp electrophysiology to investigate whether adiponectin influenced membrane properties of AP neurons and found that approximately 60% of rat AP neurons tested were sensitive to adiponectin. Additional electrophysiology experiments coupled with single-cell reverse transcription-PCR indicated that all neurons that expressed both subtypes of receptor were sensitive to adiponectin, whereas neurons expressing only one subtype were predominantly insensitive. Last, microinjection of adiponectin into AP caused significant increases in arterial blood pressure, with no change in heart rate, suggesting that adiponectin acts at AP to provide a possible link between control of energy homeostasis and cardiovascular function.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","16988040",2006,"United States"
"NOX2 and NOX4 mediate proliferative response in endothelial cells.","Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to many cardiovascular diseases. In neutrophils, ROS are generated by a NADPH oxidase containing p22phox and NOX2. NADPH oxidases are also major sources of vascular ROS. Whereas an active NOX2-containing enzyme has been described in endothelial cells, the contribution of recently identified NOX homologues to endothelial ROS production and proliferation has been controversial. The authors, therefore, compared the role of NOX2 with NOX4 and NOX1 in endothelial EaHy926 and human microvascular endothelial cells. NOX2 and NOX4 were abundantly expressed, whereas NOX1 expression was less prominent. NOX2, NOX4, and NOX1 were simultaneously present in a single cell in a perinuclear compartment. NOX2 and NOX4 co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calreticulin. Additionally, NOX2 co-localized with F-actin at the plasma membrane. NOX2 and NOX4, which interacted with p22phox, as was shown by bimolecular fluorescent complementation, contributed equally to endothelial ROS production and proliferation, whereas NOX1 depletion did not alter ROS levels under basal conditions. These data show that endothelial cells simultaneously express NOX2, NOX4, and NOX1. NOX2 and NOX4, but not NOX1, equally contributed to ROS generation and proliferation under basal conditions, indicating that a complex relation between NOX homologues controls endothelial function.","Antioxidants &amp; redox signaling","16987004",2006,"United States"
"Ginsenoside Re, a main phytosterol of Panax ginseng, activates cardiac potassium channels via a nongenomic pathway of sex hormones.","Ginseng root is one of the most popular herbs throughout the world and is believed to be a panacea and to promote longevity. It has been used as a medicine to protect against cardiac ischemia, a major cause of death in the West. We have previously demonstrated that ginsenoside Re, a main phytosterol of Panax ginseng, inhibits Ca(2+) accumulation in mitochondria during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion, which is attributable to nitric oxide (NO)-induced Ca(2+) channel inhibition and K(+) channel activation in cardiac myocytes. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that ginsenoside Re activates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) to release NO, resulting in activation of the slowly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current. The eNOS activation occurs via a nongenomic pathway of each of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor-alpha, and progesterone receptor, in which c-Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, and eNOS are sequentially activated. However, ginsenoside Re does not stimulate proliferation of androgen-responsive LNCaP cells and estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells, implying that ginsenoside Re does not activate a genomic pathway of sex hormone receptors. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments with a probe, SCCoR (single cell coactivator recruitment), indicate that the lack of genomic action is attributable to failure of coactivator recruitment. Thus, ginsenoside Re acts as a specific agonist for the nongenomic pathway of sex steroid receptors, and NO released from activated eNOS underlies cardiac K(+) channel activation and protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Molecular pharmacology","16985185",2006,"United States"
"Pacing-induced heterogeneities in intracellular Ca2+ signaling, cardiac alternans, and ventricular arrhythmias in intact rat heart.","Optical mapping studies have suggested that intracellular Ca2+ and T-wave alternans are linked through underlying alternations in Ca2+ cycling-inducing oscillations in action potential duration through Ca2+-sensitive conductances. However, these studies cannot measure single-cell behavior; therefore, the Ca2+ cycling heterogeneities within microscopic ventricular regions are unknown. The goal of this study was to measure cellular activity in intact myocardium during rapid pacing and arrhythmias. We used single-photon laser-scanning confocal microscopy to measure Ca2+ signaling in individual myocytes of intact rat myocardium during rapid pacing and during pacing-induced ventricular arrhythmias. At low rates, all myocytes demonstrate Ca2+ alternans that is synchronized but whose magnitude varies depending on recovery kinetics of Ca2+ cycling for each individual myocyte. As rate increases, some cells reverse alternans phase, giving a dyssynchronous activation pattern, even in adjoining myocytes. Increased pacing rate also induces subcellular alternans where Ca2+ alternates out of phase with different regions within the same cell. These forms of heterogeneous Ca2+ signaling also occurred during pacing-induced ventricular tachycardia. Our results demonstrate highly nonuniform Ca2+ signaling among and within individual myocytes in intact heart during rapid pacing and arrhythmias. Thus, certain pathophysiological conditions that alter Ca2+ cycling kinetics, such as heart failure, might promote ventricular arrhythmias by exaggerating these cellular heterogeneities in Ca2+ signaling.","Circulation research","16960102",2006,"United States"
"Coordinate transcriptional repression of liver fatty acid-binding protein and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein blocks hepatic very low density lipoprotein secretion without hepatosteatosis.","Unlike the livers of humans and mice, and most hepatoma cells, which accumulate triglycerides when treated with microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors, L35 rat hepatoma cells do not express MTP and cannot secrete very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), yet they do not accumulate triglyceride. In these studies we show that transcriptional co-repression of the two lipid transfer proteins, liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) and MTP, which cooperatively shunt fatty acids into de novo synthesized glycerolipids and the transfer of lipids into VLDL, respectively, act together to maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis. FAO rat hepatoma cells express L-FABP and MTP and demonstrate the ability to assemble and secrete VLDL. In contrast, L35 cells, derived as a single cell clone from FAO cells, do not express L-FABP or MTP nor do they assemble and secrete VLDL. We used these hepatoma cells to elucidate how a conserved DR1 promoter element present in the promoters of L-FABP and MTP affects transcription, expression, and VLDL production. In FAO cells, the DR1 elements of both L-FABP and MTP promoters are occupied by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha-retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), with which PGC-1beta activates transcription. In contrast, in L35 cells the DR1 elements of both L-FABP and MTP promoters are occupied by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II, and transcription is diminished. The combined findings indicate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha-RXRalpha and PGC-1beta coordinately up-regulate L-FABP and MTP expression, by competing with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II for the DR1 sites in the proximal promoters of each gene. Additional studies show that ablation of L-FABP prevents hepatic steatosis caused by treating mice with an MTP inhibitor. Our findings show that reducing both L-FABP and MTP is an effective means to reduce VLDL secretion without causing hepatic steatosis.","The Journal of biological chemistry","16950764",2006,"United States"
"A novel chemokine receptor for SDF-1 and I-TAC involved in cell survival, cell adhesion, and tumor development.","The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1; also known as chemokine ligand 12 [CXCL12]) regulates many essential biological processes, including cardiac and neuronal development, stem cell motility, neovascularization, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. It is generally believed that SDF-1 mediates these many disparate processes via a single cell surface receptor known as chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). This paper characterizes an alternate receptor, CXCR7, which binds with high affinity to SDF-1 and to a second chemokine, interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC; also known as CXCL11). Membrane-associated CXCR7 is expressed on many tumor cell lines, on activated endothelial cells, and on fetal liver cells, but on few other cell types. Unlike many other chemokine receptors, ligand activation of CXCR7 does not cause Ca2+ mobilization or cell migration. However, expression of CXCR7 provides cells with a growth and survival advantage and increased adhesion properties.

General approaches for cell delivery have thus far involved the use of direct injection of single cell suspensions into the target tissues. Additionally, tissue engineering with the general paradigm of seeding cells into biodegradable scaffolds has also evolved as a method for the reconstruction of various tissues and organs. With success in clinical trials, regenerative therapies using these approaches have therefore garnered significant interest and attention. As a novel alternative, we have developed cell sheet engineering using temperature-responsive culture dishes, which allows for the non-invasive harvest of cultured cells as intact sheets along with their deposited extracellular matrix. Using this approach, cell sheets can be directly transplanted to host tissues without the use of scaffolding or carrier materials, or used to create in vitro tissue constructs via the layering of individual cell sheets. In addition to simple transplantation, cell sheet engineered constructs have also been applied for alternative therapies such as endoscopic transplantation, combinatorial tissue reconstruction, and polysurgery to overcome limitations of regenerative therapies and cell delivery using conventional approaches.","Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society","16890320",2006,"Netherlands"
"[Relationship between the postmortem interval and nuclear DNA changes of heart muscular cells in mice].","OBJECTIVE: To study the changes of DNA degradation in cells of rats and its relationship with the postmortem interval.METHOD: 8 parameters of cell nuclear (including the tail length, the head radius, the percentage of head DNA, the percentage of tail DNA, the tail moment, the olive moment, the head area and the tail area) were chosen to study their changes in the procedure of DNA degradation in myocardium cells in 111 rats at different postmortem interval from 0 to 72 h by using single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) technology and fluorescent microscope combined with auto-analysis-image system method.RESULTS: An evident comet tailing was observed in DNA of myocardium cells after electrophoresis, and their changes in all these 8 parameters of cell nuclear were greatly associated with the extension of postmortem interval, which indicate the degradation rate and degree of DNA in the nuclear has a close relationship with postmortem interval in the periods from 0 to 72 h in rats and significant difference were found with those groups (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: The equations, which were concluded from our study, indicate the close relationship of degradation rate and degree of DNA in the nuclear with postmortem interval from 0 to 72 h, and provide an objective and exact new way to estimate the postmortem interval.","Fa yi xue za zhi","16856335",2006,"China"
"Slide-based cytometry for cytomics--a minireview.","In the postgenomic era, to gain the most detailed quantitative data from biological specimens has become increasingly important in the emerging new fields of high-content and high-throughput single-cell analysis for systems biology and cytomics.

"The time course of engraftment of human mesenchymal stem cells in fetal heart demonstrates that Purkinje fiber aggregates derive from a single cell and not multi-cell homing.","OBJECTIVE: To study the early time course of engraftment of human mesenchymal stem cells in fetal sheep heart and determine the relative roles of proliferation and homing in formation of aggregates of human Purkinje fiber cells.METHODS: The human sheep xenograft model was utilized for these studies. Prior to injection in the preimmune fetus, human cells were labeled with fluorescent dyes to be able to track human cells at early times of engraftment.RESULTS: Human stem cells were detected in fetal hearts between 29 and 39 hours after intraperitoneal injection. Engraftment was primarily in the Purkinje fiber system. By 45 hours engrafted human cells had a cardiac phenotype. When two groups of human mesenchymal stem cells, each labeled with a different fluorescent dye, were combined prior to injection, aggregates of human Purkinje fiber cells contained cells labeled with either one dye or the other, no aggregate contained cells labeled with both dyes.CONCLUSIONS: Human mesenchymal stem cells introduced into fetal sheep rapidly enter the myocardium. The swift differentiation into a cardiac phenotype indicates that the cardiac milieu has a strong influence on the fate of engrafting human mesenchymal stem cells. The absence of any aggregates of human Purkinje fiber cells containing both fluorescent dyes demonstrates that each aggregate of human Purkinje fiber cells is derived from a single mesenchymal stem cell and not from homing of multiple cells to a hotspot.","Experimental hematology","16797420",2006,"United States"
"Purified endogenous inhibitor of the Na/Ca exchanger can enhance the cardiomyocytes contractility and calcium transients.","Previous studies have shown that the newly found endogenous inhibitor (NCX(IF)) of the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) is capable of regulating the muscle strip's contractility and relaxation. Here, the effects of purified NCX(IF) were tested on single cell shortening-lengthening (by using the IR CCD camera coupled with the two-edge video-detector) and [Ca]i-transients (by monitoring the changes in fluo-3 fluorescence). A perfusion of isolated cardiomyocytes (paced at 0.5-1.0 Hz) with NCX(IF) results in 4-6-fold enhancement in the amplitude of cell shortening-lengthening reaching the steady-state levels within 5-8 min (n=20, p&lt;0.009). Simultaneous recordings of cell shortening-lengthening and [Ca]i-transients from the same cell show that the amplitude enhancement is associated with accelerated decay of both signals. Therefore, the NCX(IF)-dependent modulation of the single cell contractility is primarily governed by Ca-related mechanisms. The observed data are consistent with a proposal suggesting that the inhibition of NCX1 by NCX(IF) results in Ca-dependent activation of SERCA (SR Ca ATPase), yielding the accelerated decay of the [Ca]i-transients. The subsequent increase in the SR Ca content may result in enhanced Ca-release reflecting the manifested promotion of [Ca]i-transients. More systematic study is required for confirming this working hypothesis.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","16782052",2006,"United States"
"A new multi-scale simulation model of the circulation: from cells to system.","We developed a comprehensive cell model that simulates the sequential cellular events from membrane excitation to contraction in the human ventricle. By combining this ventricular cell model with a lumped circulation model, we examined how blood pressure dynamics in the ventricle and aorta are related to the cellular processes. To convert cell contraction into ventricular pressure using Laplace's law, we introduced a simple geometric model of a ventricle: one shaped like a thin-walled hemisphere. The force of contraction of a single cell induces tension in the hemispheric ventricular wall, which generates the ventricular and aortic pressures in the lumped circulation model. The time courses of the hemodynamic properties, as well as the volume-pressure trajectory of the left ventricle, were well reproduced. Our multi-scale cardiovascular model, which covers from cardiac cells to the circulatory system, simulates the typical characteristics of heart mechanics, such as the pressure-volume relationship, stroke volume and the effect of the increased maximum free calcium concentration on cardiovascular hemodynamics. To test the cell-circulation coupling characteristics of the model, we simulated the effects of a decrease in L-type calcium channel conductance (cell level) on left ventricular pressure (system level). The variation due to different pacing frequencies for myocyte excitation was also investigated to assess the effects of heart rate on cardiac cells and the circulatory system.","Philosophical transactions.

"Endothelial Ca2+ signal transduction is altered by postoperative serum from patients undergoing coronary surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.","Endothelial dysfunction after surgery may be caused by alterations in the intracellular signaling properties of endothelial cells. Functional alterations are believed to be systemic and dependent on the amount of invasiveness. This led us to assume that there would be a mediator in the blood. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perioperative serum obtained from patients undergoing highly invasive surgical interventions (cardiac surgery [CS] with cardiopulmonary bypass) and less invasiveness (total joint arthroplasty [TJA]) on endothelial single cell Ca2+ responses. Aortic endothelial cells were incubated with preoperative and postoperative serum samples from 26 patients undergoing CS and from 15 patients undergoing TJA. Adenosine triphosphate (100 microM)-induced alterations in FURA-2 fluorescence was used to measure intracellular Ca2+ in single cells. In CS samples the induced [Ca2+]i signals were enhanced by postoperative serum (peak levels: 96 +/- 41 FU versus 116 +/- 45 FU; P &lt; 0.05). These postoperative enhancements were absent in TJA patients serum. Preincubation of CS samples with nifedipine to block voltage gated Ca2+ channels did not alter this effect, but the absence of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the increased response from postoperative CS serum exposure. Ca2+ entry probed with Mn2+ quenching was increased in endothelial cells exposed with postoperative CS serum and Ca2+ entry correlated with postoperative circulating interleukin-6 levels (P &lt; 0.007). Endothelial functional alterations after CS with cardiopulmonary bypass are attributable, in part, to systemic factors present in serum that lead to specific endothelial enhanced Ca2+-signaling. This enhancement can be separated in vitro as an increased Ca2+ entry not present in serum from patients recovering from TJA.","Anesthesia and analgesia","16717299",2006,"United States"
"Light reaches the very heart of the zebrafish clock.","Zebrafish are typically used as a model system to study various aspects of developmental biology, largely as a consequence of their ex vivo development, high degree of transparency, and, of course, ability to perform forward genetic mutant screens. More recently, zebrafish have been developed as a model system with which to study circadian clocks. Cell lines generated from early-stage zebrafish embryos contain clocks that are directly light-responsive. We describe recent experiments using single-cell luminescent imaging approaches to study clock function in this novel cell line system. Furthermore, studies examining the process of entrainment to light pulses within this cell population are described in this review, as are experiments examining light-responsiveness of early-stage zebrafish embryos.","Chronobiology international","16687283",2006,"United Kingdom"
"Cell-to-cell electrical interactions during early and late repolarization.","Cardiac electrical activity is significantly affected by variations in the conductance of gap junctions that connect myocytes to one another. To better understand how intrinsic (single cell) electrical activity is modulated by junctional conductance, we used a two-myocyte coupling system in which physically separate cells were electrically coupled via a variable resistance set by the investigator. This brief review summarizes our findings regarding: (1) the effect of the early phase of action potential repolarization (phase 1) and transient outward current (I(to)) on action potential conduction, and (2) the effect of coupling on the action potential plateau (late repolarization). We found that inhibition of I(to) markedly increased the ability of action potentials to propagate from cell-to-cell when junctional conductance was low. Electrically coupling two myocytes together also suppressed their beat-to-beat variability in action potential duration and contraction. Similarly, early afterdepolarizations (EADS) were readily suppressed by connecting a normal myocyte to one generating EADs. This high sensitivity of the plateau to variations in junctional interactions arises from the large increase in membrane resistance that occurs during this phase of the action potential.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","16686687",2006,"United States"
"A MULTICHANNEL FIBER-OPTIC MAPPING SYSTEM FOR INTRAMURAL RECORDING OF CARDIAC ACTION POTENTIALS.","Measuring cardiac action potentials at many sites within the ventricular wall is important for understanding cardiac arrhythmias; however, recording in the depth of the heart wall presents many difficulties. We have developed a multichannel optical mapping system for recording cardiac action potentials transmurally. Each channel uses a single small-diameter optical fiber to transmit and collect light from the cardiac tissue. Excitation light is supplied by low-power green lasers. Wavelength separation is performed with a dichroic mirror, and fluorescence is detected with a photodiode. We have recorded action potentials with an unfiltered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as high as 60:1 and a temporally filtered SNR as high as 200:1. The collection of fluorescence is optimized so that low excitation light intensity can be used, which increases the available recording time. Channels are modular and compact, and the system can be easily expanded to include additional channels, ratiometry or dual-dye mapping. In addition, the system is highly flexible and can be used for virtually any experiment from single cell recording to surface and transmural mapping of the whole heart.","IFMBE proceedings","16685286",2006,"United States"
"Hyperchromatic cytometry principles for cytomics using slide based cytometry.","BACKGROUND: Polychromatic analysis of biological specimens has become increasingly important because of the emerging new fields of high-content and high-throughput single cell analysis for systems biology and cytomics. Combining different technologies and staining methods, multicolor analysis can be pushed forward to measure anything stainable in a cell. We term this approach hyperchromatic cytometry and present different components suitable for achieving this task. For cell analysis, slide based cytometry (SBC) technologies are ideal as, unlike flow cytometry, they are non-consumptive, i.e. the analyzed sample is fixed on the slide and can be reanalyzed following restaining of the object.METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate various approaches for hyperchromatic analysis on a SBC instrument, the Laser Scanning Cytometer. The different components demonstrated here include (1) polychromatic cytometry (staining of the specimen with eight or more different fluorochromes simultaneously), (2) iterative restaining (using the same fluorochrome for restaining and subsequent reanalysis), (3) differential photobleaching (differentiating fluorochromes by their different photostability), (4) photoactivation (activating fluorescent nanoparticles or photocaged dyes), and (5) photodestruction (destruction of FRET dyes). Based on the ability to relocate cells that are immobilized on a microscope slide with a precision of approximately 1 microm, identical cells can be reanalyzed on the single cell level after manipulation steps.CONCLUSION: With the intelligent combination of several different techniques, the hyperchromatic cytometry approach allows to quantify and analyze all components of relevance on the single cell level. The information gained per specimen is only limited by the number of available antibodies and sterical hindrance.","Cytometry.

"Comparative study of the effects of lacidipine and enalapril on the left ventricular cardiomyocyte remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats.","Antihypertensive medications are the most efficient drugs in achieving regression of myocardial hypertrophy in both clinical studies and animal models of hypertension. Nevertheless, there is a lack of clear and concise comparative study of their effects on the modulation of cardiomyocyte morphology and function. Here, we assessed the tissue-protective actions of 2 of these drugs, the calcium channel blocker lacidipine (3 mg/kg/day) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) in vivo, after 8 weeks of treatment of 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, as well as in vitro, after short-term (4 min) application to isolated cardiomyocytes. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was compared at organ, tissue, and single-cell level. Our data showed that both drugs prevented the LVH of 20-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, but only lacidipine significantly decreased the cardiomyocyte size. Similarly, the single-cell contractility was significantly lowered in lacidipine-treated rats only. The effect of lacidipine was initiated shortly after exposure to the drug in a dose-dependent manner at 0.5 Hz, as well as at 2 Hz, with EC(50) of 10(-7) mol/L. These results can help in understanding the effects of these drugs on the prevention of LVH.","Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology","16680070",2006,"United States"
"FK778: new cellular and molecular mechanisms of action.","PURPOSE: The new malononitrilamide FK778 is currently being evaluated as an immunosuppressant for organ transplantation. Its main mechanism is inhibition of a pivotal enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis. This report revealed new mechanisms of action on different cell types involved in acute and chronic allograft rejection.METHODS: Purified Brown-Norway rat aortic endothelial cell (EC) cultures were pretreated with several concentrations of FK778. Endothelial adhesion molecule expression (ICAM-1/VCAM-1) stimulated with TNF-alpha was quantified by immunofluorescence. Purified Lewis rat lymphocytes (LC) incubated with FK778 were stimulated via TCR/CD28 signals, and CD25 expression was quantified using FACS analysis. Uridine addition was used in all assays to reverse the pyrimidine synthesis blockade. Lymphocyte-EC interaction was assessed by micromanipulator-assisted single-cell adhesion assays. Finally, smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration was analyzed. Uridine addition was used in all assays to reverse the pyrimidine synthesis blockade.RESULTS: TNF-alpha stimulation and TCR/CD28 co-stimulation significantly increased EC ICAM-1/VCAM-1-expression and LC CD25 surface expression, respectively. These effects were dose-dependently inhibited by FK778 and were not reversed by the addition of uridine. FK778 dose-dependently attenuated LC adhesion to allogeneic EC. The dose-dependent inhibition of SMC proliferation by FK778 was abolished by uridine addition, whereas the inhibitory effect on SMC migration was not affected by uridine supplementation.CONCLUSIONS: FK778 directly reduced endothelial adhesion molecule up-regulation, inhibited lymphocyte activation, and attenuated lymphocyte-endothelium interactions, critical early steps in graft rejection. These effects were separate from the blockade of pyrimidine synthesis. The antiproliferative potency of FK778 on SMC may be an important mechanism to inhibit the fibroproliferative lesions of chronic organ rejection.","Transplantation proceedings","16647464",2006,"United States"
"[Experimental study of effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor on apoptosis of hypoxic myocardial cells in vitro].","OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor on apoptosis of hypoxic myocardial cells in vitro.METHODS: The myocardial cells were obtained from new-born Wistar rats, and were dispersed to single cell with trypsin. The cells in 4th-6th passages were randomly divided into 24 samples (every sample contained 1 x 10(5) cells): normal control group, hypoxic myocardial cells control group; hypoxic myocardial cells+NS-398 (20 micromol/L) and hypoxic myocardial cells+aspirin (100 microg/L). During culture, oxygen was replaced by N(2), and the cells were cultivated in 5% CO(2)+95% N(2) at 37 centigrade for 6 hours. Either interventional medicine or same amount of dimethyl sulphoxide was added to the cells 30 minutes before hypoxia. The expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in cultured myocardial cells in vitro was examined with Western blot. The apoptosis percentage of cells in each group was examined with flow cytometry. After centrifuging the culture medium under low temperature, 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) were determined with radioimmunoassay (RIA).RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the expression of COX-1 among the groups. The expression of COX-2 was higher in all acute hypoxic myocardial cells groups compared with the control group. Neither aspirin nor NS-392 inhibited the expression of COX-2. The positive percentage of apoptosis of cultured myocardial cells ranked as follow: hypoxic+NS-398 group, hypoxic +aspirin group, hypoxic control group and normal control group. The differences of apoptosis rate between hypoxic+NS-398 group and other groups were significant (all P&lt;0.05). The levels of TXB(2) in each group of cell medium ranked in the following order: normal control group, hypoxic +NS-398 group, hypoxic+aspirin group and hypoxic control group. The difference of TXB(2) level between hypoxic+NS-398 group and hypoxic control group was significant(P&lt;0.05). The levels of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) in each culture medium ranked in the following order: normal control group, hypoxic+aspirin group, hypoxic+NS-398 group and hypoxic control group. The difference between hypoxic+NS-398 group and hypoxic control group was significant (P&lt;0.05). The ratio of TXB(2)/6-keto-PGF(1alpha) showed no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) among groups.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that acute hypoxia could directly induce cultured myocardial cells to express COX-2, but do not effect expression of COX-1. Hypoxia could elevate the level of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and TXB(2) in culture medium. COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) could lessen the elevation, but it could not change the ratio between TXB(2) and 6-keto PGF(1alpha). NS-398 could increase apoptosis percentage of hypoxic myocardial cells in vitro, and the effect is independent of other inflammatory cells.","Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue","16647015",2006,"China"
"The Titan can help titin: from micro to macro myocardial elasticity.","Heart failure of different etiologies is due to changes in cardiac structure and function. During normal diastolic filling, the passive stretch of the ventricular myocardium is modulated by titin, a giant elastic protein that acts as a molecular spring and leads to the recapitulation of single cell mechanics at global ventricular level. The mechanics of a dilated failing heart are at least partially determined by variations in the passive filling properties of the myocardium that impair contraction. Current volume reduction surgery is based on Laplace's law and obtained by rigid means that may impair diastolic function. We postulate that inserting one or more elastic elements at different levels of a failing ventricle (the mitral annulus, equator and apex) could improve cardiac performance. We describe our invention for the first time by presenting the results of two animal experiments.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)","16645378",2006,"United States"
"Tissue-specific deletion patterns of the mitochondrial genome with advancing age.","Aging is a multifactorial process and a lot of theories have been put forward to explain the deterioration of organ function with advancing age. The free radical hypothesis developed by Harman is amongst the most prominent today and has been focused on mitochondrial aging in the last decades. Applying a long PCR approach we screened human skeletal muscle, heart, caudate nucleus and cerebellum of 50 individuals for large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The most important observation of our study was the detection of age dependent tissue specific deletion patterns of mtDNA. The pattern of the same tissue of different individuals was more similar than the pattern of different tissues of the same individuals. Whereas deletions were barely detectable in cerebellar tissue, in caudate nucleus a specific banding pattern with deletions of 4-8 kb was already observed around the age of thirty. However, the increase of these large-scale deletions in number and variety over lifetime was more pronounced in skeletal muscle or heart. Our data support the notion that different tissues accumulate mtDNA damage in a specific manner. Although functional consequences of mitochondrial deletions are clearly supported by experimental data on the single-cell level in model organisms and mammals, their role regarding impaired function of organs with advancing age in humans remains unresolved.","Experimental gerontology","16624514",2006,"England"
"Systems biology and clinical cytomics: The 10th Leipziger Workshop and the 3rd International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry, Leipzig, Germany, April 2005.","Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry.","Cytometry.

"Cardiomyocyte function after burn injury and lipopolysaccharide exposure: single-cell contraction analysis and cytokine secretion profile.","A component of multiorgan dysfunction in burned patients is heart failure. Burn trauma induces cytokine synthesis of interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) which can negatively impact cardiac function. Infectious complications are common following severe burn injury. We hypothesized that burn injury and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure independently influence peak cardiomyocyte contraction and cytokine secretion. Rats underwent a full-thickness 30% total body surface area scald or sham burn. At 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after burn, cardiomyocytes were isolated and incubated with increasing LPS doses. Peak sarcomere shortening and contractile velocity parameters were recorded using a variable-rate video camera with sarcomere length detection software. Supernatants were assayed for IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha by ELISA. Peak sarcomere shortening was decreased in the burn group at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after burn. IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels were increased in cardiomyocytes isolated 1 h after burn compared with sham controls, but returned to sham levels at 6, 12, and 24 h after burn. LPS exposure caused dose-dependent decreases in sarcomere shortening in sham and burn animals. LPS exposure did not produce increased cardiomyocyte cytokine expression. Burn injury diminished peak sarcomere shortening. Whereas exposure to LPS did not have an effect on cardiomyocyte cytokine expression, LPS significantly inhibited sarcomere shortening in a dose-dependent fashion. Combined burn and LPS exposure inhibited sarcomere shortening more than each alone. These results demonstrate that LPS exposure and burn injury independently decrease peak cardiac shortening. These decreases did not directly correlate with the levels of cytokines released in response to each stressor.","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)","16525357",2006,"United States"
"Contraction study of a single cardiac muscle cell in a microfluidic chip.","This chapter introduces a microfluidic method to study the contraction of a single cardiac muscle cell (cardiomyocyte). This method integrates single-cell selection, cell retention, dye loading, chemical stimulation, and fluorescence measurement for intracellular calcium on one microfluidic chip. Before single-cell experiments, the bonded chip was modified in order to make the channel deep enough to accommodate a large, single cardiomyocyte. After the modification, a single heart muscle cell could be selected and retained at a cell retention structure. Fluo-4 AM was loaded in the cell for the measurement of intracellular calcium ion concentration in the cell. Subsequently, caffeine was introduced into the chamber to induce the contraction of the cardiomyocyte. During contraction, fluorescence measurement was used to monitor the intracellular calcium level,and an optical imaging system was used to monitor the shape to confirm the contraction. The resting [Ca2+]i of cardiomyocyte was determined and was consistent with the value of approx 100 nM in the literature.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","16508074",2006,"United States"
"Resident human cardiac stem cells: role in cardiac cellular homeostasis and potential for myocardial regeneration.","Current treatments for myocardial infarction have significantly reduced the acute mortality of ischemic cardiomyopathy. This reduction has resulted in the survival of a large cohort of patients left with a significant 'myocyte deficit'. Once this deficit leads to heart failure there is no available therapy to improve long-term cardiac function. Recent developments in stem cell biology have focused on the possibility of regenerating contractile myocardial tissue. Most of these approaches have entailed the transplantation of exogenous cardiac-regenerating cells. Recently, we and others have reported that the adult mammalian myocardium, including that in humans, contains a small pool of cardiac stem and progenitor cells (CSCs) that can replenish the cardiomyocyte population and, in some cases, the coronary microcirculation. The human CSCs (hCSCs) are involved in maintaining myocardial cell homeostasis throughout life and participate in remodeling in cardiac pathology. They can be isolated, propagated and cloned. The progeny of a single cell clone differentiates in vitro and in vivo into myocytes, smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Surprisingly, in response to different forms of stress, hCSCs acquire a senescent, dysfunctional phenotype. Strikingly, these nonfunctional CSCs constitute around 50% of the total CSC pool in older individuals-those most likely to be candidates for hCSC-based myocardial regeneration. Therefore, the challenge to develop clinically effective therapies of myocardial regeneration is twofold: to produce the activation of the hCSCs in situ in order to obviate the need for cell transplantation, and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for hCSC senescence in order to prevent or reverse its development.","Nature clinical practice.

"Singleton births after routine preimplantation genetic diagnosis using exclusion testing (D4S43 and D4S126) for Huntington's disease.","OBJECTIVE: To develop exclusion testing protocols for Huntington's disease (HD) linkage markers suitable for use in a clinical preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) setting for couples in whom a partner was at 50% risk of inheriting HD, but who choose not to undergo presymptomatic mutation testing.DESIGN: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis using exclusion testing.SETTING: In vitro fertilization clinic.PATIENT(S: Three couples with family histories of HD, two couples opposed to direct mutation testing.INTERVENTION(S: Development of single-cell polymerase chain reaction tests for PGD for the HD mutation and two HD gene-flanking markers (D4S43 and D4S126), allowing the identification of an individual embryo as being at either low or high risk for developing HD without being diagnostic of the presence of the mutation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S: D4S43, D4S126, and HD mutation.RESULT(S: After PGD for HD, couple 1 gave birth to a healthy girl after a frozen embryo transfer, and genetic status was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis to be very low risk for developing HD. Couple 2 gave birth to a healthy boy after their second cycle of PGD, and couple 3, after a third cycle, gave birth to a boy with congenital heart defects, which were successfully corrected with surgery at age 5 days. Both couples 2 and 3 declined prenatal testing, and therefore relinquished the opportunity to confirm the PGD.CONCLUSION(S: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for HD using exclusion testing resulted in three live singleton births after six oocyte recovery procedures. The diagnostic protocol provided couples the opportunity to minimize the likelihood of disease transmission to their children, without the requirement for predictive testing.","Fertility and sterility","16500325",2006,"United States"
"A novel approach to studying transformation of human stem cells into cardiac cells in vivo.","Stem cell transplantation has been proposed as a novel means of regenerating new myocardium following cardiac damage. Many laboratories have demonstrated that stem cells from different sources have the potential to transform into cardiomyocytes. Human peripheral blood CD34+ cells were transplanted into the hearts of mice with severe combined immune deficiency syndrome, and it was demonstrated that human stem cells could transform into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Using single cell preparation, cell sorting and fluorescent in situ hybridization, human peripheral blood CD34+ cells were transformed into cardiomyocytes mainly through cell fusion, whereas endothelial cells were derived through direct differentiation of the transplanted stem cells. This analytical method should provide a novel approach to identifying the mechanisms of stem cell transformation into cardiomyocytes in vivo.","The Canadian journal of cardiology","16498515",2006,"England"
"[Investigation on spontaneous electrical activity of murine embryonic heart using microelectrode arrays].","In our studies, we have applied a novel tool, microelectrode arrays (MEA), to investigate the electrophysiological properties of murine embryonic hearts in vitro. The electrical signals were recorded from the areas of the heart adhering to the 60 MEA electrodes, being called field potentials (FPs). As an extracelluar recording, the waveform of the FP appeared similar to a reversed action potential obtained from single cell by whole cell current clamp and the FP duration was comparable with the action potential duration. To study propagation of spontaneous electrical activity, we have compared the occurrence time of FPs recorded from different electrodes. It is shown that there was already an apparent A-V delay [(50.21+/-9.7) ms] at day 9.5 post coitum (E9.5) when heart was still tubular-like and atrium and ventricle were not separated anatomically, while occurence of FP at different electrodes of ventricular area were almost synchronous. Further, we looked into the modulation of spontaneous electrical activity during cardiac development: at E9.5 of embryonic development, 1 mumol/L of isoproterenol (Iso) increased beating frequency by (34.04+/-7.31)%, shortened the A-V delay by (20.00+/-6.44) % and prolonged FP duration. In contrast, 1 mumol/L of carbachol (CCh) slowed down beating frequency by (42.32+/-5.36) %, A-V conduction by (26.00+/-4.81) % and shortened FP duration; however at late stage (E16.5), the regulatory effect of Iso and CCh was strengthened. Therefore we conclude that cardiac conduction system is already established at E9.5 when the four-chambered heart is not formed yet and the regulation of spontaneous activity by sympathetic and para-sympathetic system is gradually matured during cardiac development.","Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica]","16489406",2006,"China"
"Sequential photobleaching of fluorochromes for polychromatic slide-based cytometry.","BACKGROUND: Slide-based cytometry is a key technology for polychromatic cytomic investigations. Here we exploit the relocalization and merge feature of Laser Scanning Cytometry for distinguishing fluorochromes of comparable emission spectra but different photostabilities.METHODS: Blood specimens were stained with the fluorochrome pairs: FITC/ALEXA488, PE/ALEXA532, or APC/ALEXA633. Bleaching was performed by repeated laser excitation.RESULTS: Since ALEXA dyes are photostable as compared to the conventional fluorochromes FITC, PE, and APC, a differentiation within one fluorochrome pair is possible.CONCLUSION: The sequential photobleaching method results in an increased information density on a single cell level and represents an important component to perform polychromatic cytometry.","Cytometry.

"Theodor B¨¹cher Lecture. Metabolomics, modelling and machine learning in systems biology - towards an understanding of the languages of cells. Delivered on 3 July 2005 at the 30th FEBS Congress and the 9th IUBMB conference in Budapest.","The newly emerging field of systems biology involves a judicious interplay between high-throughput 'wet' experimentation, computational modelling and technology development, coupled to the world of ideas and theory. This interplay involves iterative cycles, such that systems biology is not at all confined to hypothesis-dependent studies, with intelligent, principled, hypothesis-generating studies being of high importance and consequently very far from aimless fishing expeditions. I seek to illustrate each of these facets. Novel technology development in metabolomics can increase substantially the dynamic range and number of metabolites that one can detect, and these can be exploited as disease markers and in the consequent and principled generation of hypotheses that are consistent with the data and achieve this in a value-free manner. Much of classical biochemistry and signalling pathway analysis has concentrated on the analyses of changes in the concentrations of intermediates, with 'local' equations - such as that of Michaelis and Menten v=(Vmax x S)/(S+K m) - that describe individual steps being based solely on the instantaneous values of these concentrations. Recent work using single cells (that are not subject to the intellectually unsupportable averaging of the variable displayed by heterogeneous cells possessing nonlinear kinetics) has led to the recognition that some protein signalling pathways may encode their signals not (just) as concentrations (AM or amplitude-modulated in a radio analogy) but via changes in the dynamics of those concentrations (the signals are FM or frequency-modulated). This contributes in principle to a straightforward solution of the crosstalk problem, leads to a profound reassessment of how to understand the downstream effects of dynamic changes in the concentrations of elements in these pathways, and stresses the role of signal processing (and not merely the intermediates) in biological signalling. It is this signal processing that lies at the heart of understanding the languages of cells. The resolution of many of the modern and postgenomic problems of biochemistry requires the development of a myriad of new technologies (and maybe a new culture), and thus regular input from the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science. One solution, that we are adopting in the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre (http://www.mib.ac.uk/) and the Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology (http://www.mcisb.org/), is thus to colocate individuals with the necessary combinations of skills. Novel disciplines that require such an integrative approach continue to emerge. These include fields such as chemical genomics, synthetic biology, distributed computational environments for biological data and modelling, single cell diagnostics/bionanotechnology, and computational linguistics/text mining.","The FEBS journal","16478464",2006,"United Kingdom"
"[Adenovirus-mediated CTLA4Ig and OX40Ig gene transfer induces long-term survival of cardiac allografts in rats].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role of CTLA4Ig gene and OX40Ig protein in inducing transplantation tolerance and the mechanisms thereof.METHODS: Thirty Lewis rats underwent transplantation of the hearts of DA rats and then randomly divided into five equal groups: control group, blank virus AdEGFP treated group (adenovirus containing EGFP at the dose of 1-5 x 10(9) pfu/ml was infused via portal vein immediately after the operation), AdCTLA4Ig treated group, AdOX40Ig treated group, and AdCTLA4Ig-IRES-OX40Ig treated group. The cardiac allograft survival was monitored by daily palpation. The total cessation of beating was defined as rejection and was confirmed by histology. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days after the administration of adenovirus. ELISA was used to detect the expression of CTLA4Ig and OX40Ig. Twenty days after the heart transplantation single splenocyte suspension was prepared from surviving Lewis rats to be used as responder. The spleens of the normal donor-DA rats and the third strain DA rats to prepare single cell suspension of the same density to perform mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Then recombinant IL-2 was added into the mixed MLR system to observe t\if the MLR could be reversed. Twenty days after the heart transplantation the splenocytes of the tolerating Lewis rats were injected into the lingual vein of the normal Lewis rats to observe the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) of the transferred Lewis rat to normal rat splenocytes. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of IL-2, interferon-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10.RESULTS: The survival time of the AdCTLA4Ig-IRES-OX40Ig treated group was 151.5 d +/- 42.6 d, significantly longer than those of the AdOX40Ig treated group (60.2 d +/- 11.4 d (P = 0.003), AdCTLA4Ig (43.2 d +/- 11.1 d, P = 0.0026), control group (5.7 d +/- 0.5 d, P = 0.000 43), and AdEGFP treated group (5.2 d +/- 0.4 d, P = 0.000 43). CTLA4Ig and/or OX40Ig proteins were expressed at a high level in the adenoviral treated rats. Compared with the control group the splenocytes of the AdCTLA4Ig-IRES-OX40Ig, AdCTLA4Ig, and AdOX40Ig treated groups displayed donor-specific hyporesponsiveness (P = 0.0016, 0.0026 and 0.001), which could be partly reversed by the addition of exogenous IL-2. Moreover, the hyporesponsiveness could be transferred to the same strain rats through adoptive transfer. In comparison with the normal controls, the expression of Th1 type cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-gamma, was significantly decreased in the tolerating rats and significantly increased in the rats with rejection; however the expression of the Th2 type cytokines, such as IL03 and IL-10, was significantly increased in the tolerating rats and significantly decreased in the rats with rejection, showing a deviation of Th1/Th2 type cytokines.CONCLUSION: AdCTLA4Ig-IRES-OX40Ig-mediated genes transfer renders prolonged expression of CTLA4Ig and OX40Ig in Lewis recipient rats, leading to a long-term survival of cardiac allografts. The induced tolerance is donor-specific, and the mechanisms may be associated with T cell anergy, deviation of Th1/Th2, and the regulatory T cells.","Zhonghua yi xue za zhi","16409867",2006,"China"
"The receptor concept: pharmacology's big idea.","Chemical signalling is the main mechanism by which biological function is controlled at all levels, from the single cell to the whole organism. Chemical recognition is the function of receptors, which, in addition to recognising endogenous chemical signals, are also the target of many important experimental and therapeutic drugs. Receptors, therefore, lie at the heart of pharmacology. This article describes the way in which the receptor concept originated early in the 20th century, and evolved through a highly innovative stage of quantitative theory based on chemical kinetics, to the point where receptors were first isolated and later cloned, until we now have a virtually complete catalogue of all the receptors present in the genome. Studies on signal transduction are revealing great complexity in the events linking ligand binding to the physiological or therapeutic response. Though some simple quantitative rules of 'receptor theory' are still useful, the current emphasis is on unravelling the pathways that link receptors to responses, and it will be some time before we know enough about them to embark on the next phase of 'receptor theory'.","British journal of pharmacology","16402126",2006,"England"
"Calcium instabilities in mammalian cardiomyocyte networks.","The degeneration of a regular heart rhythm into fibrillation (a chaotic or chaos-like sequence) can proceed via several classical routes described by nonlinear dynamics: period-doubling, quasiperiodicity, or intermittency. In this study, we experimentally examine one aspect of cardiac excitation dynamics, the long-term evolution of intracellular calcium signals in cultured cardiomyocyte networks subjected to increasingly faster pacing rates via field stimulation. In this spatially extended system, we observed alternans and higher-order periodicities, extra beats, and skipped beats or blocks. Calcium instabilities evolved nonmonotonically with the prevalence of phase-locking or Wenckebach rhythm, low-frequency magnitude modulations (signature of quasiperiodicity), and switches between patterns with occasional bursts (signature of intermittency), but period-doubling bifurcations were rare. Six ventricular-fibrillation-resembling episodes were pace-induced, for which significantly higher complexity was confirmed by approximate entropy calculations. The progressive destabilization of the heart rhythm by coexistent frequencies, seen in this study, can be related to theoretically predicted competition of control variables (voltage and calcium) at the single-cell level, or to competition of excitation and recovery at the cell network level. Optical maps of the response revealed multiple local spatiotemporal patterns, and the emergence of longer-period global rhythms as a result of wavebreak-induced reentries.","Biophysical journal","16399841",2006,"United States"
"Linking microbial community structure with function: fluorescence in situ hybridization-microautoradiography and isotope arrays.","The ecophysiology of microorganisms has been at the heart of microbial ecology since its early days, but only during the past decade have methods become available for cultivation-independent, direct identification of microorganisms in complex communities and for the simultaneous investigation of their activity and substrate uptake patterns. The combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR) is currently the most widely applied tool for revealing physiological properties of microorganisms in their natural environment with single-cell resolution. For example, this technique has been used in wastewater treatment and marine systems to describe the functional properties of newly discovered species, and to identify microorganisms responsible for key physiological processes. Recently, the scope of FISH-MAR was extended by rendering it quantitative and by combining it with microelectrode measurements or stable isotope probing. Isotope arrays have also been developed that exploit the parallel detection offered by DNA microarrays to measure incorporation of labelled substrate into the rRNA of many community members in a single experiment.","Current opinion in biotechnology","16377170",2005,"England"
"Heterogeneous pulmonary vein myocardial cell repolarization implications for reentry and triggered activity.","BACKGROUND: Myocardial cells in the pulmonary veins (PVs) are thought to play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. However, systematic single-cell microelectrode recordings from different regions in intact PV-atrial tissues are lacking.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the transmembrane action potential properties of myocardial cells in different regions of the PV and the left atrium (LA) and assess their arrhythmogenic potential during perfusion with isoproterenol (ISO) and rapid atrial pacing.METHODS: Glass microelectrode recordings of action potentials were made from the left PV and the LA in Langendorff-perfused young (3-4 month) male rats (Fisher344) (n = 9).RESULTS: Action potential duration (APD) of atrial and PV cells had similar duration at a pacing cycle length (CL) of 200 ms. However, shortening of the pacing CL to 100 ms led to heterogeneous repolarization of PV cells. Mid-PV cells had a significantly higher maximum slope of APD restitution than atrial or other PV sites. Intra-PV conduction block developed at rates when LA and proximal PV cells manifested 1:1 capture. Perfusion of ISO and rapid atrial pacing promoted the emergence of early afterdepolarization (EAD) and triggered beats in two out of nine tissues, causing premature atrial activation. No difference in resting potential or AP amplitude could be detected among the PV and LA cells.CONCLUSIONS: PV myocardial cells develop marked heterogeneity in repolarization, and there is a slight ease of developing EAD and triggered activity in response to rapid pacing and ISO infusion.","Heart rhythm","16360087",2005,"United States"
"Predominant fusion of bone marrow-derived cardiomyocytes.","OBJECTIVES: Here we address the capacity of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to trans-differentiate into mature myocytes under the physiological stimulus of exercise training.METHODS: For this purpose, we have transplanted bone marrow from mice ubiquitously expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) into host mice that have been subjected to a prolonged program of exercise.RESULTS: In all successful bone marrow reconstitutions (greater than 80%), we observed rare but consistent events of bone marrow-derived cardiomyocytes, the frequency of which was unchanged upon exercise training. We have further determined whether these recruited myocytes are a product of trans-differentiation or fusion by the use of a genetic system that distinguishes cell fusion from trans-differentiation in a single-cell assay.CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that both in the unchallenged mouse and in the trained specimens, fusion is the most prominent mechanism by which bone marrow-derived cells are observed in the myocyte compartment.","Cardiovascular research","16256964",2005,"England"
"Embryogenesis of chimeras, twins and anterior midline asymmetries.","Human spontaneous chimerism, with one body built from cells of both twins of a dizygotic (DZ) pair, is supposed to be extremely rare, arising from the exchange of blood cells through placental anastomoses. Mosaicism is supposed to be far more common, arising from single zygotes by embryonic mutation. Because typical diagnosis of mosaicism can neither identify nor exclude chimerism, 'mosaicism' may often be chimerism undiscovered. Evidence shows chimerism arises primarily from DZ embryo fusion and is not rare, although it has negligible probability under the hypothesis of independent double ovulation and independent embryogenesis. If, instead, DZ twin embryos begin development as a single cell mass, chimerism is likely. This would be consistent with observations that DZ twins develop as differently from singletons as monozygotic twins do with regard to embryogenic establishment of asymmetries of midline neural-crest-driven structures of brain, face and heart. Chimerism is a significant component of human embryonic development that deserves closer attention as a mechanism of developmental variation. The 'common knowledge' understanding of twinning mechanisms is at best inadequate. The importance of the difference lies in what we can learn from chimerism about human embryogenesis and the cellular origins of structures and functions basic to the business of becoming human.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","16253966",2005,"United States"
"Bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts are present in adult human heart valves.","BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiomyocyte chimerism has been shown to occur in the human heart. It is currently unknown whether the bone marrow contributes to cellular components of adult human heart valves. Here, it was determined whether bone marrow-derived smooth muscle-like cells (SMLC) are present in the heart valves of adult subjects.METHODS: By combining immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for X and Y chromosomes, the heart valves of gender-mismatched bone marrow transplant patients were examined for the presence of chimeric cells expressing calponin, a smooth muscle-specific protein. Concomitant staining for CD68 antigen was carried out to exclude cells of a monocytic lineage.RESULTS: The mean percentage of bone marrow-derived SMLC in valves was 0.28 +/- 0.03%, with the total proportion of chimeric cells estimated at 0.71 +/- 0.05%. The mean proportion of CD68+ cells was 0.33 +/- 0.05%. Not a single cell stained doubly for calponin and CD68 antigen.CONCLUSION: These data establish, for the first time, human bone marrow as a source of progenitor cells contributing to SMLC in adult human heart valves.","The Journal of heart valve disease","16245507",2005,"England"
"Influence of a low-molecular-weight heparin derivative on the nitric oxide levels and apoptotic DNA damage in adriamycin-induced cardiac and renal toxicity.","The spectrum of the anti-apoptotic potential of heparin is currently under scrutiny in various tissues and under various pathological situations. In this study, the role of a low-molecular-weight heparin derivative (LMWH), certoparin in adriamycin-induced oxidative DNA damage has been evaluated in the cardiac and renal tissues. Two groups of male albino rats of the Wistar strain (140+/-10 g) received a single intravenous injection of adriamycin (7.5mg/kg), and one of them received low-molecular-weight heparin (Certoparin Sodium, 300 microg/day/rat s.c.) treatment, commencing on day 8, continued for a week. The nitrosative stress in ADR cytotoxicity is indicated by the 1.51-fold cardiac and 2.36-fold renal increase in reactive nitrogen species (RNS), while LMWH treatment restores normalcy (p&lt;0.001). The influence of LMWH on the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cytokine, TNF-alpha was studied. Renal and cardiac levels of TNF-alpha showed a significant rise (p&lt;0.001) in the ADR cytotoxic group, while the TNF-alpha values departed towards control levels in the LMWH treated group (p&lt;0.001). DNA damage indicated by the fragmentation pattern (agarose gel electrophoresis) and the significantly increased comet tail length (p&lt;0.001) observed after alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis confirmed the toxicity induced by ADR on DNA in the untreated group. In the LMWH-treated group, the observation of intact DNA band after agarose gel electrophoresis, and the finding of comet tail length being comparable with that of the control substantiated the protection rendered by the LMWH, certoparin. In short, the results suggest that the low-molecular-weight heparin derivative, certoparin exerts beneficial effects on the nitrosative status, and on the biological macromolecules as DNA and curtails the rise of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha in the cardiac and renal tissues.","Toxicology","16242830",2005,"Ireland"
"Microelectrode array recordings of cardiac action potentials as a high throughput method to evaluate pesticide toxicity.","The threat of environmental pollution, biological warfare agent dissemination and new diseases in recent decades has increased research into cell-based biosensors. The creation of this class of sensors could specifically aid the detection of toxic chemicals and their effects in the environment, such as pyrethroid pesticides. Pyrethroids are synthetic pesticides that have been used increasingly over the last decade to replace other pesticides like DDT. In this study we used a high-throughput method to detect pyrethroids by using multielectrode extracellular recordings from cardiac cells. The data from this cell-electrode hybrid system was compared to published results obtained with patch-clamp electrophysiology and also used as an alternative method to further understand pyrethroid effects. Our biosensor consisted of a confluent monolayer of cardiac myocytes cultured on microelectrode arrays (MEA) composed of 60 substrate-integrated electrodes. Spontaneous activity of these beating cells produced extracellular field potentials in the range of 100 microV to nearly 1200 microV with a beating frequency of 0.5-4 Hz. All of the tested pyrethroids; alpha-Cypermethrin, Tetramethrin and Tefluthrin, produced similar changes in the electrophysiological properties of the cardiac myocytes, namely reduced beating frequency and amplitude. The sensitivity of our toxin detection method was comparable to earlier patch-clamp studies, which indicates that, in specific applications, high-throughput extracellular methods can replace single-cell studies. Moreover, the similar effect of all three pyrethroids on the measured parameters suggests, that not only detection of the toxins but, their classification might also be possible with this method. Overall our results support the idea that whole cell biosensors might be viable alternatives when compared to current toxin detection methods.","Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA","16198528",2005,"England"
"Preface: the cellular communications maze.","Inter- and intracellular ionic and molecular communications are indispensable to the preservation of life and all organic functions. The cell constantly responds to a myriad of extracellular ionic and molecular signals, and cell behavior in single-cell or multicellular organisms is coordinated by these signals moving into, inside, or between the cells. The signals pass through the cell's phospholipidic plasma membrane by diffusion and, mostly, via protein transporters: gates, receptors, and/or ion pumps imbedded in the membrane. Each signaling pathway is a complex cause and effect chain of events involving intricate networks of interactions. For example, the extracellular signals, which are monitored by the cell's membrane cognate receptors, form ligand-receptor complexes. These are typically amplified by interaction with a coupling protein, mostly a G protein, and are diversified via intracellular signal transductions, either directly or via the activation of intracellular second messengers. The present volume focuses on signal-induced interactions that trigger specific responses of the effector system. Highlighting the cellular communication framework and the major parameters encountered in these complex interactive phenomena may help to familiarize the uninitiated with the complex phenomena involved in sustaining life.","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","16196156",2005,"United States"
"Fusion of bone marrow-derived stem cells with cardiomyocytes in a heterologous in vitro model.","OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that transplanted bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMCs) possess a broad differentiation potential and are able to form new cardiomyocytes. However, the identity of BMCs as true cardiomyocytes is still ambiguous. Therefore, we investigated the fate of transplanted fluorescence labeled BMCs and cardiomyocytes in co-culture.METHODS: For cell tracking we used two different fluorescent probes, Vybrant/DiO and Vybrant/DiI. BMCs were taken from human sternal marrow, purified using a Ficoll-gradient-centrifugation, treated with 5-azacytidine and stained with Vybrant/DiO. Furthermore, isolated spontaneous beating cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats (CM) were labeled with Vybrant/DiI. Thereafter, the BMCs were transplanted into CM-cultures and investigated on day 1, 4, 7, 14 and 28 using two-color fluorescence phenotyping by laser-scanning-cytometry (LSC). Two-color positive cells were harvested by patch-clamp technique and beta-MHC mRNA expression was analyzed by single-cell PCR.RESULTS: Two different morphological phenotypes were observed by LSC. First, isolated DiO labeled BMCs without contact or with direct cell contact to DiI labeled CMs. Second, some BMCs and CMs were double positive for DiO/DiI spontaneously forming hybrids. This population increased by 18% from day 1 to 4 and decreased only slightly until day 28. Additionally, few two-color positive cell formations expressed both human and rat specific beta-MHC mRNA as well as only human beta-MHC mRNA indicating that cell-fusion and transdifferentiation has occurred.CONCLUSION: These observations provide in vitro evidence for spontaneous cell fusion and transdifferentiation of BMCs in co-culture, raising the possibility that the observed phenomenons may contribute to development or maintenance of these cell types.","European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery","16194609",2005,"Germany"
"Differentiation and lineage selection of mouse embryonic stem cells in a stirred bench scale bioreactor with automated process control.","It is well established that embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes in vitro. ES-derived cardiomyocytes could be used for pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications, provided that they can be generated in sufficient quantity and with sufficient purity. To enable large-scale culture of ES-derived cells, we have developed a robust and scalable bioprocess that allows direct embryoid body (EB) formation in a fully controlled, stirred 2 L bioreactor following inoculation with a single cell suspension of mouse ES cells. Utilizing a pitched-blade-turbine, parameters for optimal cell expansion as well as efficient ES cell differentiation were established. Optimization of stirring conditions resulted in the generation of high-density suspension cultures containing 12.5 x 10(6) cells/mL after 9 days of differentiation. Approximately 30%-40% of the EBs formed in this process vigorously contracted, indicating robust cardiomyogenic induction. An ES cell clone carrying a recombinant DNA molecule comprised of the cardiomyocyte-restricted alpha myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoter and a neomycin resistance gene was used to establish the utility of this bioprocess to efficiently generate ES-derived cardiomyocytes. The genetically engineered ES cells were cultured directly in the stirred bioreactor for 9 days, followed by antibiotic treatment for another 9 days. The protocol resulted in the generation of essentially pure cardiomyocyte cultures, with a total yield of 1.28 x 10(9) cells in a single 2 L bioreactor run. This study thus provides an important step towards the large-scale generation of ES-derived cells for therapeutic and industrial applications.","Biotechnology and bioengineering","16189818",2005,"United States"
"Glucose-dependent increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, but not cytoplasmic calcium, correlates with insulin secretion in single islet cells.","We examined the effects of different physiological concentrations of glucose on cytoplasmic Ca(2+) handling and mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) and insulin secretion in single mouse islet cells. The threshold for both glucose-induced changes in Ca(2+) and Deltapsi(m) ranged from 6 to 8 mM. Glucose step-jumps resulted in sinusoidal oscillations of cytoplasmic Ca(2+), whereas Deltapsi(m) reached sustained plateaus with oscillations interposed on the top of these plateaus. The amplitude of the Ca(2+) rise (height of the peak) did not vary with glucose concentration, suggesting a &quot;digital&quot; rather than &quot;analog&quot; character of this aspect of the oscillatory Ca(2+) response. The average glucose-dependent elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration during glucose stimulation reached saturation at 8 mM stimulatory glucose, whereas Deltapsi(m) showed a linear glucose dose-response relationship over the range of stimulatory glucose concentrations (4-16 mM). Glucose-dependent increases in insulin secretion correlated well with Deltapsi(m), but not with average Ca(2+) concentration. These data show that an ATP-dependent K(+) channel-independent pathway is operative at the single cell level and suggest mitochondrial metabolism may be a determining factor in explaining graded, glucose concentration-dependent increases in insulin secretion.","American journal of physiology.

"Quantification and characterization of myosin peptide-specific CD4+ T cells in autoimmune myocarditis.","Characterization of autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells at the single cell level is crucial for understanding the immunopathological mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases. Cardiac myosin heavy chain (myhca) is the major autoantigen associated with autoimmune myocarditis both in humans and in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in mice. In the current study, we evaluated two methods for the enumeration and phenotypic characterization of myhca-specific CD4+ T cells during the course of EAM. Both enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) assays were suitable for the detection and characterization of myhca-specific Th cells during acute myocardial inflammation and the late healing phase of the disease. Cytokine production of myhca-specific Th cells was restricted to interferon-gamma (IFNgamma). Only trace amounts of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 could be detected. Concomitant surface marker analysis in the CFC assay revealed the prototypical effector phenotype of myhca-specific Th1 cells during the acute phase of the disease. Taken together, the combination of both methods appears to be most appropriate for a comprehensive ex vivo single cell analysis of Th cells in heart-specific autoimmune disorders.","Journal of immunological methods","16125195",2005,"Netherlands"
"Genetic and cellular analyses of zebrafish atrioventricular cushion and valve development.","Defects in cardiac valve morphogenesis and septation of the heart chambers constitute some of the most common human congenital abnormalities. Some of these defects originate from errors in atrioventricular (AV) endocardial cushion development. Although this process is being extensively studied in mouse and chick, the zebrafish system presents several advantages over these models, including the ability to carry out forward genetic screens and study vertebrate gene function at the single cell level. In this paper, we analyze the cellular and subcellular architecture of the zebrafish heart during stages of AV cushion and valve development and gain an unprecedented level of resolution into this process. We find that endocardial cells in the AV canal differentiate morphologically before the onset of epithelial to mesenchymal transformation, thereby defining a previously unappreciated step during AV valve formation. We use a combination of novel transgenic lines and fluorescent immunohistochemistry to analyze further the role of various genetic (Notch and Calcineurin signaling) and epigenetic (heart function) pathways in this process. In addition, from a large-scale forward genetic screen we identified 55 mutants, defining 48 different genes, that exhibit defects in discrete stages of AV cushion development. This collection of mutants provides a unique set of tools to further our understanding of the genetic basis of cell behavior and differentiation during AV valve development.","Development (Cambridge, England)","16107477",2005,"England"
"Modelling of short QT syndrome in a heterogeneous model of the human ventricular wall.","AIMS: A percentage of sudden cardiac death events occur in individuals with structurally normal hearts due to an abnormality in the ion channel activity. While the majority of these hereditary syndromes are well-established, little is known about the significance of the short QT syndrome.METHODS: This study is based on discovered insights into the molecular basis of the originally described form of this disease. A biophysically detailed model of cellular electrophysiology was adapted to emulate the behaviour of cells affected by the short QT syndrome. Simulations were performed in single cell and homogeneous as well as heterogeneous anisotropic multi-cellular environment describing the human left ventricle.RESULTS: The short QT mutation increased the activity of the repolarizing outward potassium current I(Kr). The heterogeneous abbreviation of the action potential duration decreased the dispersion of repolarization in heterogeneous tissue. Repolarization was homogenized and the final repolarization was shifted to epicardial sites. The transmural ECG showed a shortened QT interval and a T wave with reduced amplitude.CONCLUSION: The altered characteristics of the mutant I(Kr) current were consistent with experimental findings. The heterogeneous reduction of the action potential duration and the reduced T wave amplitude need to be verified by measurements.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology","16102508",2005,"England"
"Calcium biology of the transverse tubules in heart.","Ca(2+) sparks in heart muscle are activated on depolarization by the influx of Ca(2+) through dihydropyridine receptors in the sarcolemmal (SL) and transverse tubule (TT) membranes. The cardiac action potential is thus able to synchronize the [Ca(2+)](i) transient as Ca(2+) release is activated throughout the cell. Increases in the amount of Ca(2+) within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) underlie augmented Ca(2+) release globally and an increase in the sensitivity of the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to be triggered by the local [Ca(2+)](i). In a similar manner, phosphorylation of the RyRs by protein kinase A (PKA) increases the sensitivity of the RyRs to be activated by local [Ca(2+)](i). Heart failure and other cardiac diseases are associated with changes in SR Ca(2+) content, phosphorylation state of the RyRs, [Ca(2+)](i) signaling defects and arrhythmias. Additional changes in transverse tubules and nearby junctional SR may contribute to alterations in local Ca(2+) signaling. Here we briefly discuss how TT organization can influence Ca(2+) signaling and how changes in SR Ca(2+) release triggering can influence excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. High speed imaging methods are used in combination with single cell patch clamp experiments to investigate how abnormal Ca(2+) signaling may be regulated in health and disease. Three issues are examined in this presentation: (1) normal Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release and Ca(2+) sparks, (2) abnormal SR Ca(2+) release in disease, and (3) the triggering and propagation of waves of elevated [Ca(2+)](i).","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","16093488",2005,"United States"
"[Effects of ACE inhibitor on the calcium transient and calcium handling proteins in ventricular myocytes from rats with heart failure].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of ACE inhibitor (perindopril) on the contractility and calcium transient and calcium handling proteins in ventricular myocytes from rats with experimental heart failure.METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomized to heart failure group treated with perindopril (CHF-T, 3 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), heart failure group without treatment (CHF-C) and sham-operated group (PS) after heart failure was induced by constricting abdominal aorta for 16 weeks. All groups were further followed up for 12 weeks. Left ventricular myocytes were isolated, and single cell shortening fraction and [Ca(2+)](i) were simultaneously measured through laser scanning confocal microscope under the field stimulation (1.0 Hz). RT-PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the level of mRNA and protein of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX(1)), sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA(2)) and phospholamban (PLB).RESULTS: The fraction of cell shortening (FS%) and [Ca(2+)](i max) (nmol/L) were significantly smaller in group CHF-C than group PS (FS%: 7.51 +/- 1.15 vs 13.21 +/- 1.49; [Ca(2+)](i max): 330.85 +/- 50.05 vs 498.16 +/- 14.07; both P &lt; 0.01). And in CHF-T group, FS and [Ca(2+)](i max) were greater than those in CHF-C group. In CHF-C group, the left ventricular mRNA of NCX(1) and PLB were significantly higher than those in PS group (R(NCX)(1)/beta-Actin: 0.51 +/- 0.12 vs 0.19 +/- 0.06, P &lt; 0.01; R(PLB)/beta-Actin: 0.26 +/- 0.12 vs 0.20 +/- 0.08, P = 0.045), yet SERCA(2) mRNA was lower than PS group (0.48 +/- 0.10 vs 0.80 +/- 0.11, P &lt; 0.01). In CHF-T group, the mRNA levels of NCX(1) and SERCA(2) were just in the midst of the CHF-C and PS group, and had statistical significance respectively (all P &lt; 0.05). In CHF - C and CHF - T group, the protein levels of NCX(1) were 1.141 +/- 0.047 and 1.074 +/- 0.081 times PS group, respectively (both P &lt; 0.05), and SERCA(2) protein levels were respectively 0.803 +/- 0.100 and 0.893 +/- 0.084 times as high as in PS group (both P &lt; 0.05). The protein expression of NCX(1) and SERCA(2) were also different between CHF-C and CHF-T groups (both P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: ACE inhibitor could improve cardiac function in CHF through directly enhancing the contractility of single myocardial cell, and these effects were probably mediated by its role in preventing the deleterious changes of calcium transient and calcium handling proteins in CHF.","Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi","16053783",2005,"China"
"Normal and neoplastic stem cells.","Stem cells are cells that at the single cell level both self-renew and give rise to differentiated progeny. Self renewal is the property that distinguishes stem cells and progenitors, and in the blood-forming system explains why haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), not progenitors, are the only cells capable of providing rapid and sustained regeneration of the blood-forming system after ablation by cancer chemo- and radiotherapies. Cancer-free prospectively purified HSCs regenerate the haematopoietic system of patients as rapidly as a marrow or mobilized blood transplant, but without the risk of re-seeding the body with cancer cells. Further, purified allogeneic HSCs can establish donor-specific tolerance to subsequent tissue grafts. However, in contrast to widely-publicized reports of HSC plasticity, we have not been able to show transdifferentiation of HSC to muscle, heart, brain or gut, and conclude that rare cell fusions and incomplete purifications are likely explanations for the other published results. The ability to self-renew is also potentially dangerous, as poorly regulated self renewal is, we believe, a central lesion in all cancers. We have recently shown that myeloid leukaemias in mouse and human are often driven by rare leukaemia (cancer) stem cells which are at the progenitor stage of differentiation, but have activated the self-renewing cell division pathway normally used only by HSCs. Similar cancer stem cells have been isolated in other tumours.","Novartis Foundation symposium","16050249",2005,"England"
"Prospective identification of cardiac progenitors by a novel single cell-based cardiomyocyte induction.","Dissection of cardiomyocyte differentiation process at the cellular level is indispensable in the research for cardiac development and regeneration. Previously, we have established an embryonic stem cell differentiation system that reproduces early vascular development from progenitor cells that express Flk1, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, by the combinatory application of 2-dimensional culture and flowcytometry. Here we show that cardiomyocytes can be successfully induced from a single Flk1+ cell on 2-dimensional culture, enabling the direct observation of differentiating cardiomyocytes and the prospective identification of cardiac progenitor potentials. Flk1+ cells could give rise to cardiomyocytes, as well as endothelial cells, from a single cell by the co-culture on OP9 stroma cells in a fusion-independent manner. Among the cell populations in intermediate stages from Flk1+ cells to cardiomyocytes, Flk1+/CXCR4+/vascular endothelial cadherin- cells were cardiac-specific progenitors at the single cell level. Noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor, abolished cardiomyocyte differentiation by inhibiting the cardiac progenitor induction. However, wnt inhibitors Dkk-1 or Frizzled-8/Fc chimeric protein augmented, but wnt3a inhibited, cardiomyocyte differentiation. In vitro reproduction of cardiomyocyte differentiation process should be a potent tool for the cellular and molecular elucidation of cardiac development, which would provide various targets for cardiac regeneration.","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","16033809",2005,"United States"
"The effects of cranberry juice consumption on antioxidant status and biomarkers relating to heart disease and cancer in healthy human volunteers.","BACKGROUND: Consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer. This has been ascribed in part to antioxidants in these foods inactivating reactive oxygen species involved in initiation or progression of these diseases. Non-nutritive anthocyanins are present in significant amounts in the human diet. However, it is unclear whether they have health benefits in humans.AIM: To determine whether daily consumption of anthocyanin-rich cranberry juice could alter plasma antioxidant activity and biomarkers of oxidative stress.METHODS: 20 healthy female volunteers aged 18-40 y were recruited. Subjects consumed 750 ml/day of either cranberry juice or a placebo drink for 2 weeks. Fasted blood and urine samples were obtained over 4 weeks. The total phenol, anthocyanin and catechin content of the supplements and plasma were measured. Anthocyanin glycosides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Vitamin C, homocysteine (tHcy) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured by HPLC. Total antioxidant ability was determined using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry and by the FRAP assay. Plasma total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were measured. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were measured in erythrocytes. Urine was collected for analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) by HPLC and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) by ELISA. Endogenous and induced DNA damage were measured by single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) in lymphocytes.RESULTS: Vitamin C, total phenol, anthocyanin and catechin concentrations and FRAP and ESR values were significantly higher in the cranberry juice compared with the placebo. Cyanidin and peonidin glycosides comprised the major anthocyanin metabolites [peonidin galactoside (29.2%) &gt; cyanidin arabinoside (26.1%) &gt; cyanidin galactoside (21.7%) &gt; peonidin arabinoside (17.5%) &gt; peonidin glucoside (4.1%) &gt; cyanidin glucoside (1.4 %)]. Plasma vitamin C increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) in volunteers consuming cranberry juice. No anthocyanins (plasma) or catechins (plasma or urine) were detectable and plasma total phenols, tHcy,TC,TG,HDL and LDL were unchanged. The antioxidant potential of the plasma, GSH-Px, CAT and SOD activities, and MDA were similar for both groups. Supplementation with cranberry juice did not affect 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine in urine or endogenous or H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Cranberry juice consumption did not alter blood or cellular antioxidant status or several biomarkers of lipid status pertinent to heart disease. Similarly, cranberry juice had no effect on basal or induced oxidative DNA damage. These results show the importance of distinguishing between the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities of dietary anthocyanins in relation to human health.","European journal of nutrition","16032375",2005,"Germany"
"Microfluidic selection and retention of a single cardiac myocyte, on-chip dye loading, cell contraction by chemical stimulation, and quantitative fluorescent analysis of intracellular calcium.","A microfluidic method to study the contraction of a single cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) has been developed. This method integrates various single-cell operations as well as on-chip dye loading, and quantitative analysis of intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i. After the channel enlargement by on-chip etching to accommodate large-sized cardiac myocytes, a single cell is selected and retained at a V-shaped cell retention structure within the microchip. Owing to the fragile property of the cardiac myocytes that could easily be damaged by centrifugation, the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye was loaded in the cell by on-chip dye loading. This on-chip method minimized the damage to the cells from the use of a centrifuge in the conventional method and provided a way of cellular analysis of fragile cells. Subsequently, quantitative analysis of [Ca2+]i of a single cardiac myocyte by fluorescence measurement was achieved for the first time in a microfluidic chip, thanks to the intracellular calcium stimulant of ionomycin. The resting [Ca2+]i of the cardiomyocyte determined was consistent with the literature value. From the spontaneous contraction study, it was found that fluorescence intensity cannot represent the [Ca2+]i variation accurately, which implied the importance of the quantitative analysis of [Ca2+]i.","Analytical chemistry","16013841",2005,"United States"
"Detection of thromboxane A(2) receptor mRNA in rabbit nodose ganglion neurons.","Thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) is an arachidonic acid metabolite that is released during tissue trauma and elicits platelet aggregation and vascular smooth muscle contraction. Previous research has shown that TXA(2) stimulates pulmonary and cardiac vagal afferent neurons. Therefore, we hypothesized that the presence of the TXA(2) receptor (TP) in vagal neurons would allow for stimulation or modulation of these neurons by TXA(2). To test this hypothesis, single cell RT-PCR was employed using neurons obtained from primary cell cultures of nodose ganglia excised from adult rabbits. Since the sequence for the rabbit TP gene was unknown, a portion of the rabbit TP cDNA was first amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Primer sets for TP were then designed based on this sequence and used in conjunction with a neuronal marker, medium weight neurofilament (NFM), in multiplex RT-PCR reactions. Ninety-three cells were isolated from culture and RT-PCR was carried out on individual cells. Using an aliquot from the initial RT-PCR reaction, a second round of PCR was then employed in which the NFM and TP primer sets were split up into separate reactions. Twenty-three of the 82 cells that were positive for NFM were also positive for TP. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of TP mRNA in a subset of cultured nodose ganglion neurons allows for the possibility that TXA(2) may directly stimulate or modulate vagal afferent neurons.","Neuroscience letters","15992996",2005,"Ireland"
"Kv4.2 and KChIP2 transcription in individual cardiomyocytes from the rat left ventricular free wall.","Biophysical and genetic evidence suggests that Kv4-KChIP2 heteromeric ion channels are the molecular correlate of the dominating fast component of the cardiac transient outward K+ current (Itof). Since Itof is one of the essential currents contributing to the shape of the cardiac action potential in the rat, ferret, dog, and human heart, an important implication of this concept is that all ventricular cardiac myocytes from these species express members of the Kv4 and the KChIP2 gene family. To test this prediction, we developed a modified protocol for the collection and subsequent multiplex single-cell RT-PCR amplification of RNA from individual cardiomyocytes isolated from defined regions of the rat left ventricle. All cardiomyocytes investigated (n=61) were positive for alpha-MHC and Kv4.2 expression. KChIP2 mRNA could also be detected in the vast majority (approximately 87%) of cardiomyocytes. Nearly all of these myocytes co-expressed all three cardiac splice variants of KChIP2. In a small but distinct fraction of myocytes (13%), however, we failed to detect KChIP2 mRNA. The detection thresholds were similar for all target genes and approached a sensitivity of a few molecules of RNA per cell. Our findings support the hypothesis that Itof is mediated by Kv4-KChIP2 heteromeric ion channels in the great majority of cardiac myocytes. A small subpopulation of cardiomyocytes, however, appears to express KChIP2 mRNA at insignificant levels and may therefore use other accessory subunits to generate Itof.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","15946675",2005,"England"
"[The research of relationship between DNA degradation and postmortem interval].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the DNA degradation in cells and postmortem interval.METHODS: Tissue pieces of the heart, liver, spleen and kidney of one corpse (male, 54 years old, died of mechanical injury, PMI of 6h) were obtained in 6, 12, 24, 48 h after death, fixed in Carnoy fluid, and then paraffin sections were prepared, stained with Feulgen and analyzed by Image analysis technology (IAT).

"Tissue distribution of a human Ca v 1.2 alpha1 subunit splice variant with a 75 bp insertion.","Mesenchymal stem cells from human bone marrow (MSC) express mRNA encoding the L-type Ca2+ channel Ca v 1.2 alpha1 subunit (alpha(1)1.2). We now describe a splice variant including an alternative exon of 75 bp in the region between exons 9 and 10, which we identified in MSC by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. With primers specific for variants including (+9*) or excluding the 75 bp insertion (-9*), we found comparable mRNA expression patterns in MSC and in primary cultures of related connective tissue cells (chondrocytes, osteoblasts and fibroblasts). Since culture conditions might have altered variant expression, we investigated mRNA levels in various native human tissue samples (cartilage, bone, fat, liver, kidney, aorta, bladder, cardiac ventricle and atrium, CNS). We found highest levels of the +9* variant in aorta, containing smooth muscle and connective tissue cells, but the variant was expressed in all tissues. We therefore hypothesized that broad expression of +9* might be linked to the presence of vasculature and/or connective tissue structures, rather than to tissue-specific parenchymal cells (e.g. cardiomyocytes). To test this hypothesis we separated human atrium into a cardiomyocyte-enriched fraction and a cardiomyocyte-depleted fraction. RT-PCR demonstrated significantly larger levels of the +9* variant in the non-cardiomyocyte fraction. The result was even more clear in single cell RT-PCR experiments, where the +9* variant was undetectable in cardiomyocytes but present in non-cardiomyocytes. We conclude that the +9* variant is present in all human tissues investigated so far, and suggest that expression in human atrium is associated with vascular smooth muscle and/or connective tissue cells.","Cell calcium","15916803",2005,"Netherlands"
"Electrophysiological properties of mouse bone marrow c-kit+ cells co-cultured onto neonatal cardiac myocytes.","OBJECTIVE: Controversy about hematopoietic stem cells reprogramming into cardiac myocytes is currently supported by positive and negative findings. In fact, some reports have shown the ability of stem cells from the bone marrow (BM) to differentiate into cardiac myocytes and to contribute to myocardium repair, while others have reported the opposite.METHODS: C-kit(+) cells from mouse bone marrow were co-cultured onto neonatal cardiac myocytes. Hematopoietic stem cell-derived cells were analyzed by investigating the expression of cardiac markers and ion channels and by single-cell electrophysiological recordings.RESULTS: Groups of undifferentiated c-kit(+) cells displayed only outward currents. Co-cultured c-kit(+) stem cells on neonatal cardiac myocytes expressed cardiac markers and Na(+) and Ca(2+) voltage-gated ion channels. However, Na(+) and Ca(2+) currents were not detected by electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings even if caffeine and cyclopiazonic acid treatment showed the presence of intracellular calcium stores. This suggests that these channels, although expressed, were not functional and thus do not allow the coupling between excitation and contraction that is typical of cardiac myocytes. Nevertheless, co-cultured cells had a more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and, at least in a subset of cells, displayed voltage-gated inward rectifier currents and outward currents. Co-cultured c-kit(+)-derived cells were not connected to surrounding cardiac myocytes through gap junctions. To induce a more pronounced differentiation, co-cultured cells were treated with BMP-4 and TGF-beta, two factors that were shown to trigger a cardiac myocyte differentiation pathway in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Even under these conditions, c-kit(+) cells did not differentiate into functionally active cardiac myocytes. However, TGF-beta/BMP-4-treated cells were hyperpolarized and showed and increased inward rectifier current density.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mouse BM hematopoietic stem cells exhibit a limited plasticity to transdifferentiate into cardiac myocytes in culture.","Cardiovascular research","15914113",2005,"England"
"Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on the calcium transients and calcium handling proteins in ventricular myocytes from rats with heart failure.","BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with calcium transients and calcium handling proteins. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been demonstrated to have beneficial effect on CHF. Yet studies addressed to the relationship between ACE inhibitor and calcium transients in CHF are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ACE inhibitor (perindopril) on the contractility and calcium transients and calcium handling proteins in ventricular myocytes from rats with experimental heart failure.METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomized to heart failure group treated with perindopril [CHF-T, 3 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)], heart failure group without treatment (CHF-C) and sham-operated group (PS). Heart failure was induced by abdominal aortic constriction. All groups were further followed up for 12 weeks. Left ventricular myocytes were then isolated. Single cell shortening fraction and [Ca(2+)]i were simultaneously measured by laser scanning confocal microscope under the field stimulation (1.0 Hz). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to evaluate the changes of mRNA and protein of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX1), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2) and phospholamban (PLB).RESULTS: The fraction of cell shortening (FS%) and [Ca(2+)]imax (nmol/L) were significantly reduced in group CHF-C compared with group PS (FS%: 7.51 +/- 1.15 vs 13.21 +/- 1.49; [Ca(2+)]i max: 330.85 +/- 50.05 vs 498.16 +/- 14.07; both P &lt; 0.01), and restored at least partially in CHF-T group. In CHF-C group, the left ventricular mRNA of NCX1 and PLB were significantly upregulated in comparing with PS group (RNCX1/beta-Actin: 0.51 +/- 0.12 vs 0.19 +/- 0.06, P &lt; 0.01; RPLB/beta-Actin: 0.26 +/- 0.12 vs 0.20 +/- 0.08, P &lt; 0.05), while SERCA2 mRNA was downregulated (0.48 +/- 0.10 vs 0.80 +/- 0.11, P &lt; 0.01). The mRNA levels of NCX1 and SERCA2 in CHF-T group were between the CHF-C and PS group, and the differences of the latter two groups were significant (all P &lt; 0.05).

The protein expression of NCX1 and SERCA2 in the CHF-C and CHF-T groups is significantly different (both P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: ACE inhibitor could improve cardiac function of failing heart through directly enhancing the contractility of single cardiomyocyte, and these effects are probably mediated by its roles in preventing the deleterious changes of calcium transients and calcium handling proteins in CHF.","Chinese medical journal","15899134",2005,"China"

"Do rat cardiac myocytes release ATP on contraction?","ATP is released by numerous cell types in response to mechanical strain. It then acts as a paracrine or autocrine signaling molecule, inducing a variety of biological responses. In this work, we addressed the question whether mechanical force acting on the membranes of contracting cardiomyocytes during periodic longitudinal shortening can stimulate the release of ATP. Electrically stimulated isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes as well as spontaneously contracting mouse cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells were assayed for ATP release with the use of luciferase and a sensitive charge-coupled device camera. Sensitivity of soluble luciferase in the supernatant of cardiomyocytes was 100 nM ATP, which is approximately 10-fold below the EC(50) values for most purinergic receptors expressed in the heart (1.5-20 microM). Light intensities were not different between resting or contracting adult rat cardiomyocytes. Similar results were obtained with ES-cell-derived contracting mouse cardiomyocytes. ATP release was measurable only from obviously damaged or permeabilized cells. To increase selectivity and sensitivity of ATP detection we have targeted a recombinant luciferase to the sarcolemmal membrane using a wheat germ agglutinin-IgG linker. Contraction of labeled adult rat cardiomyocytes was not associated with measurable bioluminescence. However, when human umbilical vein endothelial cells were targeted with membrane-bound luciferase, shear stress-induced ATP release could be clearly detected, demonstrating the sensitivity of the detection method. In the present study, we did not detect ATP release from contracting cardiomyocytes on the single cell level, despite adequate sensitivity of the detection system. Thus deformation of the contracting cardiomyocyte is not a key stimulus for the release of cellular ATP.","American journal of physiology. Cell physiology","15872012",2005,"United States"
"Beta-adrenergic- and muscarinic receptor-induced changes in cAMP activity in adult cardiac myocytes detected with FRET-based biosensor.","beta-Adrenergic receptor activation regulates cardiac myocyte function through the stimulation of cAMP production and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Furthermore, muscarinic receptor activation inhibits as well as facilitates these cAMP-dependent effects. However, it has not always been possible to correlate the muscarinic responses with the direct measurement of changes in cellular cAMP activity. Genetically encoded biosensors have recently been developed, making it possible to monitor real-time changes in cAMP and PKA activity at the single cell level. One such biosensor consists of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA labeled with cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins, respectively. Changes in cAMP activity affecting the association of these labeled PKA subunits can be detected as changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In the present study, an adenovirus-based approach was developed to express this recombinant protein complex in adult cardiac myocytes and use it to monitor changes in cAMP activity produced by beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor activation. The biosensor expressed with the use of this system is able to detect changes in cAMP activity produced by physiologically relevant levels of beta-adrenergic receptor activation without disrupting normal functional responses. It was also possible to directly demonstrate the complex temporal pattern of inhibitory and stimulatory changes in cAMP activity produced by muscarinic receptor activation in these cells. The adenovirus-based approach we have developed should facilitate the use of this biosensor in studying cAMP and PKA-dependent signaling mechanisms in a wide variety of cell types.","American journal of physiology.

"Adult murine skeletal muscle contains cells that can differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes in vitro.","It has long been held as scientific fact that soon after birth, cardiomyocytes cease dividing, thus explaining the limited restoration of cardiac function after a heart attack. Recent demonstrations of cardiac myocyte differentiation observed in vitro or after in vivo transplantation of adult stem cells from blood, fat, skeletal muscle, or heart have challenged this view. Analysis of these studies has been complicated by the large disparity in the magnitude of effects seen by different groups and obscured by the recently appreciated process of in vivo stem-cell fusion. We now show a novel population of nonsatellite cells in adult murine skeletal muscle that progress under standard primary cell-culture conditions to autonomously beating cardiomyocytes. Their differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes is characterized here by video microscopy, confocal-detected calcium transients, electron microscopy, immunofluorescent cardiac-specific markers, and single-cell patch recordings of cardiac action potentials. Within 2 d after tail-vein injection of these marked cells into a mouse model of acute infarction, the marked cells are visible in the heart. By 6 d they begin to differentiate without fusing to recipient cardiac cells. Three months later, the tagged cells are visible as striated heart muscle restricted to the region of the cardiac infarct.","PLoS biology","15757365",2005,"United States"
"Atrial tachycardia remodeling of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes: comparison with left atrium and potential relation to arrhythmogenesis.","BACKGROUND: The pulmonary veins (PVs) are important in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF), as is atrial tachycardia (AT) remodeling. The relative importance of AT remodeling in PVs versus other atrial sites is unknown. The present study assessed AT-induced cellular changes in PVs versus left atrium (LA) and their relationship to arrhythmogenesis.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied ionic currents (single-cell patch clamp) and action potentials (APs; coronary-perfused multicellular preparations) in the PVs and LA free wall of dogs after 7-day AT pacing (400 bpm), as well as in nonpaced control dogs. In controls, rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) delayed-rectifier currents were larger in PVs; transient-outward (I(to)), inward-rectifier (I(K1)), and L-type Ca2+ (I(Ca)) currents and AP duration were smaller. AT remodeling reduced I(Ca) and I(to), left I(Kr) and I(Ks) unchanged, and increased I(K1) in both LA and PV. AT reduced action potential duration in both LA and PV. LA-PV AP differences became smaller in AT than in control dogs. Premature extrastimuli induced atrial tachyarrhythmias at 4.5+/-2.8% (mean+/-SEM) sites in 6 control multicellular preparations compared with 64.2+/-7.3% sites in 9 AT-remodeled preparations (P&lt;0.001). Resection of all PVs failed to alter atrial tachyarrhythmia inducibility in AT-remodeled preparations (67.5+/-13.1%). PV resection did not significantly change tachyarrhythmia duration (mean 3.9 seconds per heart, range 0.7 to 15.7 seconds before resection; mean 7.0 seconds per heart, range 0.9 to 36.0 seconds after resection) or cycle length (120+/-6 ms before resection, 115+/-8 ms after resection).CONCLUSIONS: AT produces qualitatively similar ionic remodeling in LA and PVs but reduces PV-LA AP differences. PVs are not essential for AT-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia promotion in this model, which may relate to the failure of PV isolation to prevent AF in some patient populations.","Circulation","15699259",2005,"United States"
"Clonally expanded novel multipotent stem cells from human bone marrow regenerate myocardium after myocardial infarction.","We have identified a subpopulation of stem cells within adult human BM, isolated at the single-cell level, that self-renew without loss of multipotency for more than 140 population doublings and exhibit the capacity for differentiation into cells of all 3 germ layers. Based on surface marker expression, these clonally expanded human BM-derived multipotent stem cells (hBMSCs) do not appear to belong to any previously described BM-derived stem cell population. Intramyocardial transplantation of hBMSCs after myocardial infarction resulted in robust engraftment of transplanted cells, which exhibited colocalization with markers of cardiomyocyte (CMC), EC, and smooth muscle cell (SMC) identity, consistent with differentiation of hBMSCs into multiple lineages in vivo. Furthermore, upregulation of paracrine factors including angiogenic cytokines and antiapoptotic factors, and proliferation of host ECs and CMCs, were observed in the hBMSC-transplanted hearts. Coculture of hBMSCs with CMCs, ECs, or SMCs revealed that phenotypic changes of hBMSCs result from both differentiation and fusion. Collectively, the favorable effect of hBMSC transplantation after myocardial infarction appears to be due to augmentation of proliferation and preservation of host myocardial tissues as well as differentiation of hBMSCs for tissue regeneration and repair. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a specific population of multipotent human BM-derived stem cells can induce both therapeutic neovascularization and endogenous and exogenous cardiomyogenesis.","The Journal of clinical investigation","15690083",2005,"United States"
"Concentric zones of active RhoA and Cdc42 around single cell wounds.","Rho GTPases control many cytoskeleton-dependent processes, but how they regulate spatially distinct features of cytoskeletal function within a single cell is poorly understood. Here, we studied active RhoA and Cdc42 in wounded Xenopus oocytes, which assemble and close a dynamic ring of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin-2 around wound sites. RhoA and Cdc42 are rapidly activated around wound sites in a calcium-dependent manner and segregate into distinct, concentric zones around the wound, with active Cdc42 in the approximate middle of the F-actin array and active RhoA on the interior of the array. These zones form before F-actin accumulation, and then move in concert with the closing array. Microtubules and F-actin are required for normal zone organization and dynamics, as is crosstalk between RhoA and Cdc42. Each of the zones makes distinct contributions to the organization and function of the actomyosin wound array.

The action potential upstrokes were simulated using the PSpice program for circuit analysis. Either a single cell was stimulated (cell A1) or the entire chain was stimulated simultaneously (A-chain). Transverse velocity was calculated from the total propagation time (TPT) from when the first AP crossed a Vm of -20 mV and the last AP crossed -20 mV. The number of g-j channels per junction was varied from zero to 100, 1,000 and 10,000 (Rgj of infinity, 100 MOmega, 10 MOmega, 1.0 MOmega, respectively). The longitudinal resistance of the interstitial fluid (ISF) space between the parallel chains (Rol2) was varied between 200 KOmega (standard value) and 1.0, 5.0, and 10 MOmega. The higher the Rol2 value, the tighter the packing of the chains. It was found that adding many g-j channels inhibited transverse propagation by blocking activation of all 5 chains, unless Rol2 was greatly increased above the standard value of 200 KOmega. This was true for either method of stimulation. This was explained by, when there is strong longitudinal coupling between all 5 cells of a chain awaiting excitation, there must be more transfer energy (i.e., more current) to simultaneously excite all 5 cells of a chain.","Biomedical engineering online","15679888",2005,"England"
"Identification and characterization of embryonic stem cell-derived pacemaker and atrial cardiomyocytes.","The aim of this study was to identify and functionally characterize cardiac subtypes during early stages of development. For this purpose, transgenic embryonic stem cells were generated using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter driving the expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). EGFP-positive clusters of cells were first observed as early as 7 days of development, thus, even before the initiation of the contractile activity. Flow cytometry and single-cell fluorescence measurements evidenced large diversities of EGFP intensity. Patch-clamp experiments showed EGFP expression exclusively in pacemaker and atrial but not ventricular cells. The highest fluorescence intensities were detected in pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes. In accordance, multielectrode-array recordings of whole embryoid bodies confirmed that the pacemaker center coincided with strongly EGFP-positive areas. The cardiac subtypes displayed already at this early stage differential characteristics of electrical activity and ion channel expression. Thus, quantitation of the alpha-myosin heavy chain driven reporter gene expression allows identification and functional characterization of early cardiac subtypes.","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","15659535",2005,"United States"
"Induction of ventricular arrhythmias following mechanical impact: a simulation study in 3D.","Commotio cordis, mechanical induction of heart rhythm disturbances, including sudden cardiac death, in the absence of corresponding structural damage, has been reported with increasing frequency in young individuals participating in sporting activities. Recently, the electrophysiological changes during c. cordis have been attributed to mechano-electric feedback, and particularly, to the recruitment of stretch-activated ion channels. The underlying mechanisms, however, by which a mechanical impact results in ventricular fibrillation, remain unknown. This study employs a 3D realistic model of rabbit ventricular geometry and fiber orientation to elucidate the electrophysiological mechanisms involved in arrhythmia induction following acute mechanical stimulation of the heart. Impact effects are modeled through stretch-activated ion channel activation in a 3D region of the ventricles representing the impact profile. Both cation-nonselective and potassium-selective stretch-activated ion channels are recruited upon mechanical impact. The impact is administered at various coupling intervals following pacing at the apex. To aid in the interpretation of results, the effect of mechanical stimulation on single cell action potentials is also examined. The results demonstrate that the region of impact is characterized by different types of cellular responses, including generation of a new action potential, shortening, or lengthening of action potential duration. The impact induces sustained reentry only when (1) a new activation is elicited by mechanical stimulation (caused by activation of cation-nonselective stretch-activated ion channels), and (2) upon return to the original region of impact, this activation does not encounter an extension of action potential duration (prevented by activation of potassium-selective stretch-activated ion channels).","Journal of molecular histology","15614623",2004,"United States"
"Characterization of membrane N-glycan binding sites of lysozyme for cardiac depression in sepsis.","PURPOSE: In sepsis, reversible myocardial depression has been ascribed to the release of mediators of inflammation. We previously found that lysozyme released from leukocytes from the spleen and other organs mediated myocardial depression in an Escherichia coli model of septic shock in dogs. We hypothesize that lysozyme binds to or cleaves a cardiac surface membrane N-glycoprotein to cause depression. The objectives of the present study were: 1) to determine whether the binding of lysozyme is reversible; 2) to assess the N-glycan structure to which lysozyme binds; 3) to examine whether nonenzymatic proteins, termed lectins, with a binding specificity similar to that of lysozyme could also cause depression; and 4) to assess whether the membrane to which lysozyme binds is affected by the enzymes protease type XIV and collagenase A, that are used to prepare single cell myocyte experiments.METHODS: We measured isometric contraction in a right ventricular trabecular preparation.RESULTS: We found that lysozyme binds in a reversible manner to the Man beta(1-4) GlcNAc beta(1-4)GlcNAc moiety in the tri-mannosyl core structure of high mannose/hybrid and tri-antennary carbohydrate classes where GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosamine and Man is mannose. Lectins with a specificity similar to that of lysozyme also caused depression, and lysozyme's depressant activity was eliminated by protease type XIV and collagenase A.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that lysozyme reversibly binds to a membrane glycoprotein to cause myocardial depression in sepsis. We further localize its binding site to a variant of the chitotriose structure in the tri-mannosyl core of the membrane glycoprotein.","Intensive care medicine","15605233",2004,"United States"
"Potassium and carrot embryogenesis: are K+ channels necessary for development?","The expression pattern of the KDC1 gene, coding for an inwardly-rectifying K(+) channel of Daucus carota , is described in several embryo stages and seedling tissues. Relative quantitative RT-PCR experiments indicated that, during (somatic) embryonic development, the KDC1 transcript appears as early as the globular stage and that the transcript level remains constant throughout the successive heart and torpedo stages. Thereafter, the KDC1 transcript is preferentially expressed in plant roots, but is also present in other tissues, and in particular, in the shoot apical meristem. In situ hybridisation experiments showed that in embryos KDC1 mRNA is detectable preferentially in protoderm cells with a stage dependent expression pattern. At later times, the hybridisation signal is particularly evident in root hairs, root epidermis and endodermis, but is also observed in single cell layers corresponding to L1 of the shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia. Promoter studies with the beta -glucuronidase reporter gene confirm preferential expression of KDC1 in embryo protoderm cells and in plant root epidermis and root hairs. Western blot analysis of embryonic proteins and immunolocalisation experiments on somatic embryos sections revealed the presence of KDC1 during embryo development. Consistent with these observations, patch-clamp experiments performed on protoplasts isolated from embryos at the torpedo stage demonstrated the presence of functional inward rectifying K(+) channels. This is the first report on the expression of a plant ion channel during embryo development.","Plant molecular biology","15604655",2004,"Netherlands"
"Nitric oxide modulation of glutamatergic, baroreflex, and cardiopulmonary transmission in the nucleus of the solitary tract.","The neuromodulatory effect of NO on glutamatergic transmission has been studied in several brain areas. Our previous single-cell studies suggested that NO facilitates glutamatergic transmission in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). In this study, we examined the effect of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on glutamatergic and reflex transmission in the NTS. We measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) from Inactin-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Bilateral microinjections of L-NAME (10 nmol/100 nl) into the NTS did not cause significant changes in basal MAP, HR, or RSNA. Unilateral microinjection of (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA, 1 pmol/100 nl) into the NTS decreased MAP and RSNA. Fifteen minutes after L-NAME microinjections, AMPA-evoked cardiovascular changes were significantly reduced. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 0.5 pmol/100 nl) microinjection into the NTS decreased MAP, HR, and RSNA. NMDA-evoked falls in MAP, HR, and RSNA were significantly reduced 30 min after L-NAME. To examine baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary reflex function, L-NAME was microinjected at multiple sites within the rostro-caudal extent of the NTS. Baroreflex function was tested with phenylephrine (PE, 25 microg iv) before and after L-NAME. Five minutes after L-NAME the decrease in RSNA caused by PE was significantly reduced. To examine cardiopulmonary reflex function, phenylbiguanide (PBG, 8 microg/kg) was injected into the right atrium. PBG-evoked hypotension, bradycardia, and RSNA reduction were significantly attenuated 5 min after L-NAME. Our results indicate that inhibition of NOS within the NTS attenuates baro- and cardiopulmonary reflexes, suggesting that NO plays a physiologically significant neuromodulatory role in cardiovascular regulation.","American journal of physiology.

"Mofarotene-induced inhibition of melanoma cell motility by increasing vinculin-containing focal contacts.","Tumour cell motility, which is dependent on the organization of the cytoskeleton, is considered to play an important role in the spread of malignant melanoma. Therefore, retinoids, which are modulators of cytoskeletal organization, may affect the motile activity of melanoma cells. In this study, the effects of the arotinoid mofarotene on single cell motility and vinculin organization of the highly metastatic melanoma cell line K-1735-M2 were determined. Melanoma cells were cultivated in a temperature- and CO2-controlled microincubator, which was located on the microscope stage. Cell movements were evaluated quantitatively from time-lapse video recordings using an IBAS image analysis system. Vinculin distribution was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy and a specially developed computerized image analysing program. In addition, melanoma cell invasion was tested on the embryonic chick heart model. Although 10 microM mofarotene did not reduce the translocative movements of melanoma cells, it significantly inhibited stationary motility, including fast plasma membrane movements and changes in shape. Mofarotene also showed a pronounced effect on the organization of vinculin-containing cell-substratum adhesion plaques. In retinoid-treated cells, the numbers of vinculin plaques per cell, and particularly those in the marginal areas of the cells, were significantly increased compared with untreated controls. Furthermore, the compound reduced the invasiveness of melanoma cells in a three-dimensional tissue culture model. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that mofarotene, an already almost forgotten synthetic retinoid, shows interesting effects on melanoma cells, which may be relevant for a slowdown of tumour spread.","Melanoma research","15577329",2004,"England"
"Ultrastructure of right ventricular myocardium subjected to acute pressure load.","BACKGROUND: Ultrastructural data on acute right ventricular pressure load in pigs are rare.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In control (n = 7) and banding groups (n = 6), right ventricular pressure (micromanometry) and function (sonomicrometry) were measured. Right ventricular pressure was increased 2.5-fold in the banding group by pulmonary artery constriction. Right ventricular biopsies were taken at baseline and after 6 h and processed for electron microscopy. Parameters of cellular injury were determined stereologically. Three perfusion -fixed hearts were investigated qualitatively in each group.RESULTS: Stereology revealed an increase in the sarcoplasmic volume fraction and the cellular edema index in the banding group ( p &lt; 0.05). Mitochondrial surface-to-volume ratio and volume fraction did not show significant alterations. Subendocardial edema and small amounts of severely injured myocytes were observed in the perfusion-fixed hearts after banding. Ultrastructure was normal in controls. After an initial increase, the right ventricular work index declined progressively in the banding group but remained unchanged in controls.CONCLUSIONS: Ultrastructural alterations resulting from acute right ventricular pressure load were characterized by edema of subendocardial myocytes and single cell necrosis. Focal adrenergic overstimulation and mechanical stress are probably more relevant in the pathogenesis of these lesions than ischemia.","The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon","15573272",2004,"Germany"
"Evaluation of DNA damage in lymphocytes of cardiologists exposed to radiation during cardiac catheterization by the COMET ASSAY.","This study was designed to evaluate the possible in vivo induction of DNA damage by exposure to radiation in cardiologists. The alkaline comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis, SCGE), which appears to be a promising tool with which to estimate DNA damage at the single cell level, has been used. The assay was carried out on 30 cardiologists currently employed in a busy cardiac service and 30 healthy unexposed controls. Venous blood samples were obtained from the exposed and control subjects and SCGE was examined in 100 cells graded as undamaged, intermediate, and tailed nuclei. The number of undamaged nuclei was almost the same in control and exposed subjects. The extent of DNA migration (SCGE assay) did not distinguish between the samples in either the nonsmoker exposed or nonsmoker control subjects, which leads one to wonder whether a difference in DNA damage really exists. Previous studies reported increased DNA damage in blood lymphocytes of smokers. In our study, the percentage of damaged cells increased either with the frequency of smoking or exposure to radiation. A statistically significant difference was observed both in smokers and exposed subjects. In conclusion, the elevated grade of DNA damage in cardiologists exposed to radiation indicates a possible genotoxic hazard, therefore, careful measures and full cooperation between cardiologists and radiologists should be undertaken to reduce the exposure to radiation.","Japanese heart journal","15557725",2004,"Japan"
"DNA damaging effects of sulfur dioxide derivatives in cells from various organs of mice.","The DNA-damaging effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) derivatives (a mixture of sodium sulfite and sodium bisulfite, 3:1 M/M) in the cells of various organs (brain, lung, heart, liver, stomach, spleen, thymus, bone marrow and kidney) of male mice were studied using the single cell gel electrophoresis technique (SCGE). Three groups of six mice each received an i.p. dose of SO2 derivatives (125, 250 or 500 mg/kg body wt) daily for 7 days. A control group of six mice received 200 microl of normal saline i.p. daily for 7 days. Our results show that SO2 derivatives caused significant increases in olive tail moment (OTM) in cells from all organs tested in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that SO2 derivatives can cause DNA damage to multiple organs of mice and that SO2 derivatives are systemic DNA-damaging agents, not only to the respiratory system. It is suggested that SO2 derivative exposure has a potential risk to DNA in multiple organs of mammals and might be related to carcinogenesis or other diseases related to DNA damage. Further work is required to understand the toxicological role of SO2 and its derivatives on multiple or even all organs in humans and animals. Recent research results have shown that SO2 and its derivatives can also induce an increase in the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in mammalian cells and cause oxidative damage in multiple organs of male and female mice. Taken together, these results suggest that SO2 and its derivatives are systemic toxic agents. However, further studies need to be performed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.","Mutagenesis","15548758",2004,"England"
"[Measurement of systolic/diastolic function in isolated ventricular myocytes by video-based motion edge-detection system].","AIM: Single cardiomyocytes were isolated from adult rat hearts and myocyte contraction was recorded by a video-based motion edge-detection system.METHODS: Single ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated, loaded with fura-2/AM (0.5 micromol/L) for 30 min in dark at room temperature and field-stimulated (0.5 Hz, 5 ms), and both myocyte contraction and intracellular fluorescence intensity were simultaneously assessed by a video-based motion edge-detection system.RESULTS: Using the video-based motion edge-detection system, one may real-time beat-to-beat observe and record the amplitude, duration and velocity of both myocyte shortening/ relengthening and intracellular calcium transient, and then directly describe the change of isolated ventricular myocyte mechanics.CONCLUSION: Direct measurement of isolated ventricular myocyte mechanics using the video-based motion edge-detection system is an increasingly important technique in cardiac physiology that provides fundamental information on myogenic and excitation-contraction coupling of the heart in drug intervention and gene manipulation.","Zhongguo ying yong sheng li xue za zhi = Zhongguo yingyong shenglixue zazhi = Chinese journal of applied physiology","21158130",2004,"China"
"Dimensionality in cardiac modelling.","The development of mathematical models of the heart has been an ongoing concern for many decades. The initial focus of this work was on single cell models that incorporate varyingly detailed descriptions of the mechanisms that give rise to experimentally observed action potential shapes. Clinically relevant heart rhythm disturbances, however, are multicellular phenomena, and there have been many initiatives to develop multidimensional representations of cardiac electromechanical activity. Here, we discuss the merits of dimensionality, from 0D single cell models, to 1D cell strands, 2D planes and 3D volumes, for the simulation of normal and disturbed rhythmicity. We specifically look at models of: (i) the origin and spread of cardiac excitation from the sino-atrial node into atrial tissue, and (ii) stretch-activated channel effects on ventricular cell and tissue activity. Simulation of the spread of normal and disturbed cardiac excitation requires multicellular models. 1D architectures suffer from limitations in neighbouring tissue effects on individual cells, but they can (with some modification) be applied to the simulation of normal spread of excitation or, in ring-like structures, re-entry simulation (colliding wave fronts, tachycardia). 2D models overcome many of the limitations imposed by models of lower dimensionality, and can be applied to the study of complex co-existing re-entry patterns or even fibrillation. 3D implementations are closest to reality, as they allow investigation of scroll waves. Our results suggest that 2D models offer a good compromise between computational resources, complexity of electrophysiological models, and applicability to basic research, and that they should be considered as an important stepping-stone towards anatomically detailed simulations. This highlights the need to identify and use the most appropriate model for any given task. The notion of a single and ultimate model is as useful as the idea of a universal mechanical tool for all possible repairs and servicing requirements in daily life. The ideal model will be as simple as possible and as complex as necessary for the particular question raised.","Progress in biophysics and molecular biology","15471590",2004,"United Kingdom"
"New technologies for the human cytome project.","Cytomes or cell systems are composed of various kinds of single-cells and constitute the elementary building units of organs and organisms. Their individualised (cytomic) analysis overcomes the problem of averaged results from cell and tissue homogenates where molecular changes in low frequency cell populations may be hidden and wrongly interpreted. Analysis of the cytome is of pivotal importance in basic research for the understanding of cells and their interrelations in complex environments like tissues and in predictive medicine where it is a prerequisite for individualised preventive therapy. Analysis of molecular phenotypes requires instrumentation that on the one hand provides high-throughput measurement of individual cells and is on the other hand highly multiplexed, enabling the simultaneous acquisition of many parameters on the single cell level. Upcoming technology suitable to this task, such as slide based cytometry is available or under development. The realisation of cytomic technology is important for the realisation of the human cytome project.","Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents","15471209",2004,"Italy"
"Micro-electrode arrays in cardiac safety pharmacology: a novel tool to study QT interval prolongation.","Drug-induced QT interval prolongation is now a major concern in safety pharmacology. Regulatory authorities such as the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency require in vitro testing of all drug candidates against the potential risk for QT interval prolongation prior to clinical trials. Common in vitro methods include organ models (Langendorff heart), conventional electrophysiology on cardiac myocytes, and heterologous expression systems of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels. A novel approach is to study electrophysiological properties of cultured cardiac myocytes by micro-electrode arrays (MEA). This technology utilises multi channel recording from an array of embedded substrate-integrated extracellular electrodes using cardiac tissue from the ventricles of embryonic chickens. The detected field potentials allow a partial reconstruction of the shape and time course of the underlying action potential. In particular, the duration of action potentials of ventricular myocytes is closely related to the QT interval on an ECG. This novel technique was used to study reference substances with a reported QT interval prolonging effect. These substances were E4031, amiodarone, quinidine and sotalol. These substances show a significant prolongation of the field potential. However, verapamil, a typical 'false positive' when using the hERG assay does not cause any field potential prolongation using the MEA assay. Whereas the heterologous hERG assay limits cardiac repolarisation to just one channel, the MEA assay reflects the full range of mechanisms involved in cardiac action potential regulation. In summary, screening compounds in cardiac myocytes with the MEA technology against QT interval prolongation can overcome the problem of a single cell assay to potentially report 'false positives'.","Drug safety","15350150",2004,"New Zealand"
"Measuring the modulatory effects of RGS proteins on GIRK channels.","Discovery of &quot;regulators of G-protein signaling&quot; (RGS) as GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins has provided a highly sought &quot;missing link,&quot; reconciling past discrepancies between the in vitro GTPase activity of purified G proteins and the kinetics of physiological responses mediated by G-protein signaling in vivo. With the number of RGS genes in the mammalian genome at more than 30, associating specific RGS proteins to specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling events has become a focus of RGS investigators. The ubiquitous expression of multiple RGS proteins has complicated this effort, yet the outlook has been encouraged with the identification of RGS9 as the determinant mediating rapid recovery of the transducin-dependent photoresponse. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels that mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission via GPCR activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are similarly accelerated by RGS proteins when reconstituted in heterologous cell expression systems and fully reproduce the gating properties of native GIRK channels in neurons and cardiomyocytes. The endogenous neuronal and cardiac RGS protein(s) that accelerate GPCR--&gt;GIRK channel-gating kinetics are currently not known. This article describes methods used to measure the receptor-dependent GIRK channel-gating parameters reconstituted in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and Xenopus oocytes, as well as rat atrial myocytes and rat cerebellar granule neurons as model cells with native GPCR--&gt;GIRK channel signaling. Applications of these methods for structure-function-based studies of RGS proteins, G proteins, and GPCRs are discussed. We also describe single cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods developed to profile atrial myocyte and neuronal RGS expression to identify specific RGS proteins for targeted knockdown or knockout.","Methods in enzymology","15313564",2004,"United States"
"The pivotal role of nitric oxide for vascular health.","The endothelium is a single cell layer that lines all blood vessels. This tissue produces an impressive array of paracrine factors that maintain vascular homeostasis. One of these factors is the potent vasodilator endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). Impairment in the synthesis or bioactivity of NO, as manifested by reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation, has been shown to be an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events. The linkage between endothelium-derived NO and cardiovascular health is likely due to the pleiotropic effects of NO on the vessel wall. NO inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, the aggregation of platelets, and the adherence and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Thus, an impairment of NO bioactivity or synthesis will reduce its braking effect on processes involved in atherogenesis. New insights have been made regarding the mechanisms by which NO bioactivity becomes impaired. Cardiovascular risk factors induce vascular oxidative stress, which accelerates the degradation of NO. In addition, oxidative stress causes the accumulation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthesis. Elevation of ADMA appears to be a common mediator by which cardiovascular risk factors impair NO synthesis. Elevation of plasma ADMA has been linked to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, carotid intimal thickening and adverse cardiovascular events. A number of modern therapies directed against atherosclerosis also improve the function of the NO synthase pathway. New agents that specifically target the NO synthase pathway have been developed, and represent a new front on the war against heart disease.","The Canadian journal of cardiology","15309199",2004,"United States"
"Transgenic upregulation of IK1 in the mouse heart leads to multiple abnormalities of cardiac excitability.","To assess the functional significance of upregulation of the cardiac current (IK1), we have produced and characterized the first transgenic (TG) mouse model of IK1 upregulation. To increase IK1 density, a pore-forming subunit of the Kir2.1 (green fluorescent protein-tagged) channel was expressed in the heart under control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. Two lines of TG animals were established with a high level of TG expression in all major parts of the heart: line 1 mice were characterized by 14% heart hypertrophy and a normal life span; line 2 mice displayed an increased mortality rate, and in mice &lt; or =1 mo old, heart weight-to-body weight ratio was increased by &gt;100%. In adult ventricular myocytes expressing the Kir2.1-GFP subunit, IK1 conductance at the reversal potential was increased approximately 9- and approximately 10-fold in lines 1 and 2, respectively. Expression of the Kir2.1 transgene in line 2 ventricular myocytes was heterogeneous when assayed by single-cell analysis of GFP fluorescence. Surface ECG recordings in line 2 mice revealed numerous abnormalities of excitability, including slowed heart rate, premature ventricular contractions, atrioventricular block, and atrial fibrillation. Line 1 mice displayed a less severe phenotype. In both TG lines, action potential duration at 90% repolarization and monophasic action potential at 75-90% repolarization were significantly reduced, leading to neuronlike action potentials, and the slow phase of the T wave was abolished, leading to a short Q-T interval. This study provides a new TG model of IK1 upregulation, confirms the significant role of IK1 in cardiac excitability, and is consistent with adverse effects of IK1 upregulation on cardiac electrical activity.","American journal of physiology.

"Free reactive oxygen species and nephrotoxicity of contrast agents.","BACKGROUND: The nephrotoxicity induced by contrast media remains a serious clinical problem, and the underlying mechanism has not been completely understood. Experimental and clinical investigations suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical determinants of radiocontrast nephropathy (RCN), and that antioxidants can prevent this damage.METHODS: Cultured human proximal renal tubule cells (HK-2) were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at different concentrations. H2O2-induced tubular DNA damage was examined in the presence of the antioxidant MESNA (sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate). The induction of DNA damage was measured with the alkaline comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). We also studied 12 patients with stable renal impairment (median baseline creatinine 296 micromol/l; range: 203-495 micromol/l) undergoing cardiac catheterization/intervention prospectively. Patients received 800 mg MESNA intravenously 30 min before exposure to the contrast agent in addition to 0.9% saline hydration.RESULTS: In the cell cultures, oxidative stress on HK-2 cells induced increased DNA migration in the comet assay. Treatment of tubular cells with the antioxidant MESNA prior to the addition of H2O2 significantly reduced DNA migration in the comet assay. In the clinical study, treatment of the patients with MESNA prevented the adverse renal effect of contrast media (median serum creatinine 293; range: 187-433 micromol/l) 48 h after coronary angiography/intervention.CONCLUSION: Both the in vivo and the in vitro studies suggest that the ROS-mediated renal injury could be inhibited by a potent antioxidant such as MESNA.","Kidney &amp; blood pressure research","15256812",2004,"Switzerland"

We examined adult human (Hu) and rhesus macaque (Rh) pancreatic tissue for the presence of SP cells.</AbstractText>: Side population (SP) cells defined by their ability to efflux Hoechst dye 33342 (Hst), demonstrate functional stem cell capabilities in adult murine tissues and may represent organ-specific stem cells. We examined adult human (Hu) and rhesus macaque (Rh) pancreatic tissue for the presence of SP cells.METHODS: Hu cadaver (n = 4) and Rh donor (n = 5) pancreata were dispersed with collagenase and separated by density gradient centrifugation to relatively enrich fractions for islet, ductal, and acinar tissue in human and islet and nonislet tissue in Rh. Single cell suspensions were incubated with varying Hst concentrations to determine optimal conditions for SP cell analysis. Cellular heterogeneity was assessed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies positive for hematopoietic and/or endothelial cells.RESULTS: Hu SP cells comprised approximately 0.12%, 0.08%, and 0.45% of the gated populations for Hu islet, ductal, and acinar fractions respectively. In Rh, 5.5% and 3.7% of the islet and nonislet fractions were identified as SP cells. FACS analysis of Hu pancreas-derived SP cells indicated that greater than 95% were CD45(-), and only 6% were CD34(+)CD45(-). A similar phenotype was detected in Rh pancreas-derived SP cell populations: greater than 70% were CD45(-) and less than 2% were endothelial lineage positive.CONCLUSIONS: SP cells are found in both islet- and nonislet-enriched fractions of the adult Hu and Rh pancreas. The majority of pancreatic SPs are CD45(-) and CD34(-), suggesting nonhematopoietic lineage. Further preclinical study is needed to establish the phenotype and functional role of adult tissue-specific versus tissue-resident stem cells.","Transplantation proceedings","15194404",2004,"United States"
"On-chip single-cell-based microcultivation method for analysis of genetic information and epigenetic correlation of cells.","We have developed an on-chip single-cell based microcultivation method for analyzing the variability of genetic information stored in single cells and their epigenetic correlations. The method uses four systems: an on-chip cell sorter for purifying the cells in a non-destructive manner; an on-chip single-cell cultivation chip for isolating single cells; an on-chip agarose microchamber system for constructive cell-cell network formation during cultivation; and an on-chip single-cell-based expression analysis system. Using these systems, we could measure the variability of prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells having the same DNA and found that, although prokaryotic cells have a large variability in their interdivision times, sister eukaryotic cells having the same DNA synchronized well. We also measured the dynamics of synchronization of beating cardiac myocytes and found that two isolated cells synchronize by one cell following the other after a short pause in beating. These results showed the potential of the on-chip microcultivation method's constructive approach to analyzing cell systems.","Journal of molecular recognition : JMR","15137028",2004,"England"

"Role of gap junctions in the propagation of the cardiac action potential.","Gap junctions play a pivotal role for the velocity and the safety of impulse propagation in cardiac tissue. Under physiologic conditions, the specific subcellular distribution of gap junctions together with the tight packaging of the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes underlies anisotropic conduction, which is continuous at the macroscopic scale. However, when breaking down the three-dimensional network of cells into linear single cell chains, gap junctions can be shown to limit axial current flow and to induce 'saltatory' conduction at unchanged overall conduction velocities. In two- and three-dimensional tissue, these discontinuities disappear due to lateral averaging of depolarizing current flow at the activation wavefront. During gap junctional uncoupling, discontinuities reappear and are accompanied by slowed and meandering conduction. Critical gap junctional uncoupling reduces conduction velocities to a much larger extent than does a reduction of excitability, which suggests that the safety for conduction is higher at any given conduction velocity for gap junctional uncoupling. In uniformly structured tissue, gap junctional uncoupling is accompanied by a parallel decrease in conduction velocity. However, this is not necessarily the case for non-uniform structures like tissue expansion where partial uncoupling paradoxically increases conduction velocity and has the capacity to remove unidirectional conduction blocks. Whereas the impact of gap junctions on impulse conduction is generally assessed from the point of view of cell coupling among cardiomyocytes, it is possible that other cell types within the myocardium might be coupled to cardiomyocytes as well. In this context, it has been shown that fibroblasts establish successful conduction between sheets of cardiomyocytes over distances as long as 300 microm. This might not only explain electrical synchronization of heart transplants but might be of importance for cardiac diseases involving fibrosis. Finally, the intriguing fact that sodium channels are clustered at the intercalated disc recently rekindled the provocative question of whether gap junctions alone are responsible for impulse propagation or whether electric field mechanisms might account for conduction as well. Whereas computer simulations show the feasibility of conduction in the absence of gap junctional coupling, a definite answer to this question must await further investigations into the biophysical properties of the intercalated disc.","Cardiovascular research","15094351",2004,"England"
"Quantitative analysis of the formation and diffusion of A1-adenosine receptor-antagonist complexes in single living cells.","The A1-adenosine receptor (A1-AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates many of the physiological effects of adenosine in the brain, heart, kidney, and adipocytes. Currently, ligand interactions with the A1-AR can be quantified on large cell populations only by using radioligand binding. To increase the resolution of these measurements, we have designed and characterized a previously undescribed fluorescent antagonist for the A1-AR, XAC-BY630, based on xanthine amine congener (XAC). This compound has been used to quantify ligand-receptor binding at a single cell level using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). XAC-BY630 was a competitive antagonist of A1-AR-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation [log10 of the affinity constant (pKb) = 6.7)] and stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation (pKb = 6.5). Specific binding of XAC-BY630 to cell surface A1-AR could also be visualized in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-A1 cells by using confocal microscopy. FCS analysis of XAC-BY630 binding to the membrane of CHO-A1 cells revealed three components with diffusion times (tauD) of 62 micros (tauD1, free ligand), 17 ms (tauD2, A1-AR-ligand), and 320 ms (tauD3). Confirmation that tauD2 resulted from diffusion of ligand-receptor complexes came from the similar diffusion time observed for the fluorescent A1-AR-Topaz fusion protein (15 ms). Quantification of tauD2 showed that the number of receptor-ligand complexes increased with increasing free ligand concentration and was decreased by the selective A1-AR antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The combination of FCS with XAC-BY630 will be a powerful tool for the characterization of ligand-A1-AR interactions in single living cells in health and disease.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","15070776",2004,"United States"
"Single cell mechanics of rat cardiomyocytes under isometric, unloaded, and physiologically loaded conditions.","One of the most salient characteristics of the heart is its ability to adjust work output to external load. To examine whether a single cardiomyocyte preparation retains this property, we measured the contractile function of a single rat cardiomyocyte under a wide range of loading conditions using a force-length measurement system implemented with adaptive control. A pair of carbon fibers was used to clamp the cardiomyocyte, attached to each end under a microscope. One fiber was stiff, serving as a mechanical anchor, while the bending motion of the compliant fiber was monitored for force-length measurement. Furthermore, by controlling the position of the compliant fiber using a piezoelectric translator based on adaptive control, we could change load dynamically during contractions. Under unloaded conditions, maximal shortening velocity was 106 +/- 8.9 microm/s (n = 13 cells), and, under isometric conditions, peak developed force reached 5,720 nN (41.6 +/- 5.6 mN/mm(2); n = 17 cells). When we simulated physiological working conditions consisting of an isometric contraction, followed by shortening and relaxation, the average work output was 828 +/- 123 J/m(3) (n = 20 cells). The top left corners of tension-length loops obtained under all of these conditions approximate a line, analogous to the end-systolic pressure-volume relation of the ventricle. All of the functional characteristics described were analogous to those established by studies using papillary muscle or trabeculae preparations. In conclusion, the present results confirmed the fact that each myocyte forms the functional basis for ventricular function and that single cell mechanics can be a link between subcellular events and ventricular mechanics.","American journal of physiology.

"Application of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to the measurement of agonist binding to a G-protein coupled receptor at the single cell level.","The A1-adenosine receptor (A1-AR) is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily, which has significant pathophysiological importance in disorders such as heart arrhythmias, asthma and stroke. Here, we have used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to facilitate the study of A1-AR pharmacology at the subcellular level. To this end, we have successfully designed and synthesised a fluorescently labelled A1-AR agonist, ABA-BY630. ABA-BY630 is an N6- derivative of adenosine conjugated to the red-excited fluorophore, BODIPY&quot; 630/650. In CHO cells expressing the human A1-AR, ABA-BY630 shows strong and potent agonist activity at this receptor. Specific binding of ABA-BY630 to the A1-AR in cell membranes of living CHO cells can also be visualised using confocal microscopy. Moreover, using FCS, we can detect and quantify the binding of ABA-BY630 to the A1-AR in a small area (0.2 microm2) of the upper cell membrane. FCS measurements indicate the presence of at least two populations of receptor-ABA-BY630 complexes with diffusion times of 8 and 233 ms. The quantity of both of these complexes was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with the A1-AR antagonist DPCPX. Application of FCS in conjunction with ABA-BY630 will allow the comparison of A1-AR pharmacology in single cells from healthy and diseased tissue.","Faraday discussions","14992407",2004,"England"
"Clonogenic analysis reveals reserve stem cells in postnatal mammals. II. Pluripotent epiblastic-like stem cells.","Undifferentiated cells have been identified in the prenatal blastocyst, inner cell mass, and gonadal ridges of rodents and primates, including humans. After isolation these cells express molecular and immunological markers for embryonic cells, capabilities for extended self-renewal, and telomerase activity. When allowed to differentiate, embryonic stem cells express phenotypic markers for tissues of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origin. When implanted in vivo, undifferentiated noninduced embryonic stem cells formed teratomas. In this report we describe a cell clone isolated from postnatal rat skeletal muscle and derived by repetitive single-cell clonogenic analysis. In the undifferentiated state it consists of very small cells having a high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. The clone expresses molecular and immunological markers for embryonic stem cells. It exhibits telomerase activity, which is consistent with its extended capability for self-renewal. When induced to differentiate, it expressed phenotypic markers for tissues of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origin. The clone was designated as a postnatal pluripotent epiblastic-like stem cell (PPELSC). The undifferentiated clone was transfected with a genomic marker and assayed for alterations in stem cell characteristics. No alterations were noted. The labeled clone, when implanted into heart after injury, incorporated into myocardial tissues undergoing repair. The labeled clone was subjected to directed lineage induction in vitro, resulting in the formation of islet-like structures (ILSs) that secreted insulin in response to a glucose challenge. This study suggests that embryonic-like stem cells are retained within postnatal mammals and have the potential for use in gene therapy and tissue engineering.","The anatomical record.

"Fluorescence imaging of electrical activity in cardiac cells using an all-solid-state system.","Tracking spatial and temporal determinants of cardiac arrhythmogenesis at the cellular level presents challenges to the optical mapping techniques employed. In this paper, we describe a compact system combining two nontraditional low-cost solutions for excitation light sources and emission filters in fluorescence measurements of transmembrane potentials, Vm, or intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i in cardiac cell networks. This is the first reported use of high-power blue and green light emitting diodes (LEDs), to excite cell monolayers stained with Vm - (di-8-ANEPPS) or [Ca2+]i - (Fluo-3) sensitive dyes. In addition, we use simple techniques for fabrication of suitable thin emission filters with uniform properties, no auto-fluorescence, high durability and good flexibility for imaging Vm or [Ca2+]i. The battery-operated LEDs and the fabricated emission filters, integrated with a fiber-optic system for contact fluorescence imaging, were used as tools to characterize conduction velocity restitution at the macro-scale. The versatility of the LEDs for illumination is further emphasized through 1) demonstration of their usage for epi-illumination recordings at the single-cell level, and 2) demonstration of their unique high-frequency light modulation ability. The LEDs showed excellent stability as excitation light sources for fluorescence measurements; acceptable signal-to-noise ratio and negligible cell photodamage and indicator dye photobleaching were observed.","IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering","14765706",2004,"United States"
"Quantitative reconstruction of cardiac electromechanics in human myocardium: regional heterogeneity.","INTRODUCTION: Regional heterogeneity of electrophysiologic properties within the human ventricles is based on changes in ion channel kinetics and density inside the wall. The heterogeneity not only influences the electrophysiologic properties but also cellular force development. In this study, the influence of heterogeneity was investigated using mathematical models.METHODS AND RESULTS: An overview of measurements of the heterogeneity of electrophysiology and force development is presented. This knowledge is transferred to an electromechanical heart model composed of a human ionic cell model describing electrophysiologic properties and a model for the development of forces. Heterogeneity is included in the ionic model by changing ion channel kinetics and density. The characteristics and dependencies of the electromechanical model are demonstrated in a single-cell environment and a multicell environment. In the single-cell environment, the effects of heterogeneity on electrical activity are demonstrated. The notch in the action potential decreases from epicardium to endocardium, and action potential duration is longest in the mid-myocardium. The developed forces are largest in the subendocardial cells and decrease continuously toward the epicardium. The multicell environment describes a transmural line of cells in the left ventricular free wall using a bidomain approach. The transmural ECG shows typical characteristics with a positive monophasic T wave.CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the need to incorporate regional heterogeneity in order to model human cardiac electromechanics. The results of electrophysiologic simulations correspond to measured data. The dependencies of regional heterogeneity on force development need to be validated in experiments, because little is known about the influence of heterogeneity on electromechanical coupling.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","14760927",2004,"United States"
"Altered T wave dynamics in a contracting cardiac model.","INTRODUCTION: The implications of mechanical deformation on calculated body surface potentials are investigated using a coupled biophysically based model.METHODS AND RESULTS: A cellular model of cardiac excitation-contraction is embedded in an anatomically accurate two-dimensional transverse cross-section of the cardiac ventricles and human torso. Waves of activation and contraction are induced by the application of physiologically realistic boundary conditions and solving the bidomain and finite deformation equations. Body surface potentials are calculated from these activation profiles by solving Laplace's equation in the passive surrounding tissues. The effect of cardiac deformation on electrical activity, induced by contraction, is demonstrated in both single-cell and tissue models. Action potential duration is reduced by 7 msec when the single cell model is subjected to a 10% contraction ramp applied over 400 msec. In the coupled electromechanical tissue model, the T wave of the ECG is shown to occur 18 msec earlier compared to an uncoupled excitation model. To assess the relative effects of myocardial deformation on the ECG, the activation sequence and tissue deformation are separated. The coupled and uncoupled activation sequences are mapped onto the undeforming and deforming meshes, respectively. ECGs are calculated for both mappings.CONCLUSION: Adding mechanical contraction to a mathematical model of the heart has been shown to shift the T wave on the ECG to the left. Although deformation of the myocardium resulting from contraction reduces the T wave amplitude, cell stretch producing altered cell membrane kinetics is the major component of this temporal shift.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","14760925",2004,"United States"
"Systematic changes in gene expression in postmortem human brains associated with tissue pH and terminal medical conditions.","Studies of gene expression abnormalities in psychiatric or neurological disorders often involve the use of postmortem brain tissue. Compared with single-cell organisms or clonal cell lines, the biological environment and medical history of human subjects cannot be controlled, and are often difficult to document fully. The chance of finding significant and replicable changes depends on the nature and magnitude of the observed variations among the studied subjects. During an analysis of gene expression changes in mood disorders, we observed a remarkable degree of natural variation among 120 samples, which represented three brain regions in 40 subjects. Most of such diversity can be accounted for by two distinct expression patterns, which in turn are strongly correlated with tissue pH. Individuals who suffered prolonged agonal states, such as with respiratory arrest, multi-organ failure or coma, tended to have lower pH in the brain; whereas those who experienced brief deaths, associated with accidents, cardiac events or asphyxia, generally had normal pH. The lower pH samples exhibited a systematic decrease in expression of genes involved in energy metabolism and proteolytic activities, and a consistent increase of genes encoding stress-response proteins and transcription factors. This functional specificity of changed genes suggests that the difference is not merely due to random RNA degradation in low pH samples; rather it reflects a broad and actively coordinated biological response in living cells. These findings shed light on critical molecular mechanisms that are engaged during different forms of terminal stress, and may suggest clinical targets of protection or restoration.","Human molecular genetics","14734628",2004,"United States"
"[Peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma ligands ameliorate autoimmune myocarditis associated with inhibition of T cell immunity].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) on autoimmune myocarditis, and to test the hypothesis that PPAR-gamma ligands reduce experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) associated with inhibition of the expansion and activation of self-sensitive T cells.METHODS: EAM was induced in Lewis rats by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin. Then the rats were divided into 3 groups of 9 rats: PPAR-gamma ligand 15-deoxy-(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) group (15d-PGJ(2) was injected intraperitoneally at the dosage of 200 microg.kg(-1).d(-1)), pioglitazone (PIO) group (PIO was mixed with the food and than fed at the dosage of 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), and positive control group (phosphate-buffered saline was injected intraperitoneally). Nine normal rats were used as normal controls. Three weeks later, the rats underwent thoracotomy to undergo pathologic examination. The numbers of CD4(+) cells, CD8(+) cells, and macrophages were calculated by microscopy. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the location and expression of PPAR gamma. Western blotting was used to examine the relative amount of PPAR gamma protein. The proliferative response and the cytotoxicity of T cell-enriched splenocytes and lymph node cells were determined. Another rats were killed 12 days after immunization. Their spleens and lymph nodes were taken out. T-cell rich splenocytes and cells from the lymph nodes were cultured. Cardiac myosin and 15d-PGJ(2) were added. [(3)H] thymine was added 72 hours after. ELISA was used to examine the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the supernatant. 15d-PGJ(2), PIO, or PBS were given to immunize the rats. The rats were killed 12 days after. The lymph nodes were taken out to make single cell suspension. (51)Cr was used to label the cells so as to calculate the %cytotoxicity.RESULTS: All immunized rats showed myocarditis. The numbers of CD4(+) cells, CD8(+) T cells, and macrophages, were 18 +/- 5, 7 +/- 2, and 45 +/- 8/six 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm squares. PPAR gamma was mainly located in the nuclear and perinuclear regions of infiltrating inflammatory cells, such as mononuclear cells and macrophage-like cells. The expression of PPAR gamma in the myocardium of EAM rats was 3.7 times higher than of the normal rats. The heart weight/body weight ratio, pericardial effusion scores, macroscopic scores and microscopic scores of the 15d-PGJ group were significantly lower than those of the positive control group. The numbers of CD4(+) cells of the 15d-PGJ and PIO groups were 8 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 3, both significantly lower than that of the positive control group (both P &lt; 0.01), the numbers of CD8(+) cells of the 15d-PGJ and PIO groups were 3 +/- 1 and 4 +/- 2 respectively, both significantly lower than that of the positive control group (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05), and the numbers of macrophages of the 15d-PGJ and PIO groups were 22 +/- 4 and 26 +/- 6 respectively, both significantly lower than that of the positive control group (both P &lt; 0.01). The myocardiogenicity and the severity of myocarditis of the 15d-PGJ(2)- and PIO-groups were at lower degrees compared with those of the positive control group. The % cytotoxic activity was 10.2% +/- 2.6% in the 15d-PGJ(2) group and was 11.6% +/- 3.7% in the PIO group, both significantly lower than that of the positive control group (37.7% +/- 8.4%, both P &lt; 0.01) Stimulated by cardiac myosin, the T-cell rich splenocytes and cells from lymph nodes showed obvious proliferation and production of IFN-gamma. The cardiac myosin-stimulated cell proliferation and production of IFN-gamma in the 15d-PGJ(2) and PIO groups were significantly reduced in comparison with those in the positive control group.CONCLUSION: PPAR-gamma ligands ameliorate EAM associated with inhibition of expansion and activation of the self-sensitive T cells.","Zhonghua yi xue za zhi","14703419",2004,"China"
"Expression of glycopeptide-resistance gene in response to vancomycin and teicoplanin in the cardiac vegetations of rabbits infected with VanB-type Enterococcus faecalis.","VanB-type resistance in enterococci corresponds to resistance to vancomycin but not to resistance to the related glycopeptide teicoplanin, because the vanB gene cluster is activated by the VanR(B)-VanS(B) 2-component regulatory system in response to vancomycin but not to teicoplanin. Mutations in the vanS(B) gene allow for constitutive or teicoplanin-inducible expression of the resistance genes. To analyze in vivo expression of the van genes in rabbits with experimental endocarditis, a VanB-type Enterococcus faecalis with a transcriptional fusion between the P(YB) promoter of resistance genes and the gfpmut1 gene for the green-fluorescent protein in the chromosome was constructed. Rounded heaps containing fluorescent bacteria were detected in vegetation slides from rabbits treated with vancomycin but not in those from control rabbits, revealing induction of a tightly regulated vanB gene cluster. Teicoplanin-resistant mutants were detected as fluorescent bacteria in rabbits treated with teicoplanin. Thus, the reporter system monitored expression of a glycopeptide-resistance gene in vivo at a single-cell level.","The Journal of infectious diseases","14702158",2004,"United States"
"Hemangioblasts, angioblasts, and adult endothelial cell progenitors.","After decades of speculation, proof of embryonic hemangioblasts finally emerged a few years ago. Surprisingly, at about the same time, evidence for adult hemangioblasts began to appear, and recent single-cell bone marrow transplants have confirmed their existence. Embryonic and adult hemangioblasts appear to share antigenic determinants, including CD34, ACC133, and VEGFR2, although their phenotype may be plastic. They also respond to similar factors, prominent among them vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the adult, hemangioblasts reside principally in the bone marrow, although they may subsequently leave that niche to reside in nonhematopoietic tissues. A number of studies indicate that these cells or their progeny may be a significant source of endothelial cells in adult pathologic and nonpathologic vascularization, and may participate in vascular repair. In addition to hemangioblasts, a more differentiated source of endothelial cell progenitors may be present in the blood, namely, monocytes or monocytic-like cells. The relative importance of the two cell types in vivo is not clear, though endothelial cells derived from the two sources may not be identical, and hemangioblasts seem to provide a stimulus for differentiation of the monocytes. Treatment with exogenous bone marrow-derived cells can promote neovascularization, accelerate restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues, and improve cardiac function after infarct. Hence, there is great hope that either alone, in combination with angiogenic factors, or as gene therapy vectors, we can harness these cells to treat ischemic and vascular diseases in the relatively near future.","The anatomical record.

"Improved regional left ventricular function after successful satellite cell grafting in rabbits with myocardial infarction.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether satellite cells injected into infarct areas in rabbits remain viable during 6 weeks follow-up and can improve cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography.METHODS: Myocardial infarction was induced in 16 New Zealand white rabbits, by ligation of the marginalis sinistra artery. Tissue from gluteus muscle biopsies was dissected into small pieces and cultured. Within 2-3 weeks the cells were expanded by 2-3 orders of magnitude and were fluorescent labeled. Single cell pellets for resuspension at &gt;10(6)/1 ml were directly injected into the infarct areas in 8 rabbits. In 8 additional rabbits, 1 ml saline was injected (control). Regional left ventricular function was assessed weekly by 2-D echocardiography until animals were sacrificed. Analysis was performed blind and independently by two experienced echocardiographers, based on the American Society of Echocardiography scheme.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Six treated and five control rabbits completed the study. One week after the artery occlusion, left ventricular function scoring did not differ between groups, mean 8.7+/-1.6 vs 8.3+/-1.9 (P=0.74). At 6 weeks post-injection, echocardiographic score was significantly better in the treated group, mean 2.6+/-0.9 vs 6.9+/-2.1 (P=0.002). The treated group showed significant gradual segmental improvement between the first week up to week 6. After sacrifice, macro and microscopic transmural areas showed typical changes of myocardial infarction. Histochemical staining identified viable grafted cells in high density 6 weeks post-transplantation in all grafted hearts.CONCLUSION: Autologous satellite cells (skeletal myofiber), can be successfully grafted into rabbit hearts following myocardial infarction and may induce improved regional left ventricular function.","European journal of heart failure","14675853",2003,"England"
"Gene expression profile of cardiomyocytes in hypertrophic heart induced by continuous norepinephrine infusion in the rats.","Catecholamines play an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To observe cardiomyocyte-specific gene expression changes induced by catecholamines in vivo, left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats after continuous infusion of norepinephrine (NE; 0.2 mg/kg per hour intravenously) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. The gene expression profiles of these cells during different NE infusion stages were assessed by using a cDNA microarray, and the microarray data were further analyzed by a clustering method. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced upon continuous NE infusion, with the peak at 3 days. Meanwhile, manifest changes in gene expression profile within cardiomyocytes over the time course were revealed, most of the genes never having been reported to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy. The number of genes displaying differential expression also peaked at the middle stage of infusion (2-3 days), and the majority of the signaling molecules were found differentially expressed mainly at this stage, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, etc. The tumor suppressor p53 was found up-regulated at very early (0.5 days) and late stages (7 days) of NE infusion. Self-organization clustering analysis revealed subsets of coordinate regulated genes. One set consisted of several enzymes involved in energy metabolism, including carnitine octanoyltransferase, ATP synthase subunit c, pancreatic lipase and glycogen phosphorylase, possessing a similar expression pattern with a rapidly elevated expression level at the early stage of NE infusion. This is the first study to provide transcriptional information for cardiomyocytes, a single cell type, in the heart during the development of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, and may provide accurate clues to elaborate hypotheses about the evolution of this pathology.","Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","14618266",2003,"Switzerland"
"Detection of DNA fragmentation in a single apoptotic cardiomyocyte by electrophoresis on a microfluidic device.","The detection of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in individual cardiomyocytes was performed on a microfluidic device. Microstructures integrated on a CD-like plastic disk were adapted for the selection of individual cells their lysis in an alkaline environment and the separation of released apoptotic DNA fragments. The fragments with typical 180 base pairs ladder pattern were electrophoretically resolved in a 2% solution of linear polyacrylamide with 0.1 M NaOH on a migration distance of 6 mm. The laser-induced fluorescence of fragments labeled by ethidium bromide was monitored by a photomultiplier tube mounted on a confocal microscope. The causal relation between the enhanced doxorubicin concentration and the extent of DNA fragmentation in a single cell was confirmed. The results show that the extent of DNA fragmentation is proportional to the time of a cell treatment. Onset of necrosis was evident in cardiomyocytes treated by doxorubicin for more than 24 h. The adverse effect of doxorubicin, an important cytostatics used for the treatment of many solid tumors, leads to the destruction of cardiomyocytes and, consequently, may result in the heart failure of treated individuals. Therefore, the monitoring of the extent of apoptotic DNA damage of cardiac myocytes represents critical step toward understanding of the development of chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.","Electrophoresis","14613205",2003,"Germany"
"Deficiency of PDK1 in cardiac muscle results in heart failure and increased sensitivity to hypoxia.","We employed Cre/loxP technology to generate mPDK1(-/-) mice, which lack PDK1 in cardiac muscle. Insulin did not activate PKB and S6K, nor did it stimulate 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and production of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, in the hearts of mPDK1(-/-) mice, consistent with PDK1 mediating these processes. All mPDK1(-/-) mice died suddenly between 5 and 11 weeks of age. The mPDK1(-/-) animals had thinner ventricular walls, enlarged atria and right ventricles. Moreover, mPDK1(-/-) muscle mass was markedly reduced due to a reduction in cardiomyocyte volume rather than cardiomyocyte cell number, and markers of heart failure were elevated. These results suggested mPDK1(-/-) mice died of heart failure, a conclusion supported by echocardiographic analysis. By employing a single-cell assay we found that cardiomyocytes from mPDK1(-/-) mice are markedly more sensitive to hypoxia. These results establish that the PDK1 signalling network plays an important role in regulating cardiac viability and preventing heart failure. They also suggest that a deficiency of the PDK1 pathway might contribute to development of cardiac disease in humans.","The EMBO journal","12970179",2003,"United Kingdom"
"Defects in cardiac conduction system lineages and malignant arrhythmias: developmental pathways and disease.","To unravel the complex disease phenotype of heart failure, we are utilizing an integrative approach employing genomics, physiology, and mouse genetics to identify nodal pathways for specific physiological end points such as myocyte stretch activation responses, contractility and electrical conduction. A new class of genetic pathways for cardiac sudden death and associated arrhythmias has been based on transcription factors that control conduction system lineages, including HF1b/SP4 and NKX2.5. Previous studies have established that HF1b plays a critical role in conduction system lineage formation and the loss of HF1b leads to a confused electrophysiological identity in Purkinje and ventricular cell lineages, resulting in cardiac sudden death and marked tachy and brady arrhythmias. Utilizing Hf1b and Nkx2.5 floxed alleles, we now have identified the primary pathways which link these transcription factors with cardiac arrythmogenesis. Mice which harbour a neural crest restricted knockout of HF1b display marked arrhythmogenesis and conduction system defects, implicating neural crest cues in conduction system development and disease. Mice which harbour a ventricular-restricted knockout of Nkx2.5 display completely normal conduction at birth, but a hypoplastic atrioventricular (AV) node. During maturation, progressive complete heart block ensues, associated with a selective dropout of distal AV nodal cell lineages at the boundaries of the penetrating His bundle. Single cell analyses examining individual nodal cells within AV node of ventricular restricted Nkx2.5 knockout mice clearly document a cell autonomous requirement for NKX2.5 within AV nodal lineages per se. Micro-electrophysiological AV nodal mapping indicates a selective conduction defect at the boundary of the distal AV node and His bundle. HF1b and NKX2.5 reflect new cardiac cell non-autonomous and autonomous pathways for conduction system lineage defects and associated cardiac arrythmogenesis.","Novartis Foundation symposium","12956335",2003,"England"
"Exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy: a substrate for sudden death in athletes?","Cardiac hypertrophy is a general term signifying an increase in cardiac mass in response to applied stress. In mild, early hypertrophy, cardiac myocyte contractile performance may be normal or enhanced, whereas in severe hypertrophy associated with cardiac failure, myocyte contraction is reduced in amplitude and increased in duration. In contrast to the varied contractile response, the duration of electrical excitation shows similar changes in both mild and severe hypertrophy. Action potential duration in mid-myocardial and sub-epicardial layers is increased, which is associated with ventricular arrhythmias (in a similar manner to the long QT syndromes from other causes), based on afterdepolarizations and enhanced automaticity. Single-cell studies following exercise training in animal models show that exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy displays features similar to mild, compensated hypertrophy from other causes. Developed shortening of unloaded single cells is increased or unchanged, and developed force in single myocytes is enhanced. Action potential duration is increased, apart from in the sub-endocardial layer. As with mild hypertrophy from other causes, this will be pro-arrhythmic because of altered dispersion of repolarization and enhanced automaticity. Major abnormalities of the ECG in man include frequent and complex ventricular ectopy, ST segment changes and prolongation of repolarization. In this review a case is presented for regarding exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy as being no different from mild cardiac hypertrophy resulting from other, pathological causes. The cellular electrophysiological changes are sufficient to account for many of the abnormalities of the ECG, including high-grade ventricular ectopy. Sudden death in trained athletes who have no evidence of specific heart disease may be a direct consequence of cardiac hypertrophy and altered repolarization.","Experimental physiology","12955164",2003,"England"
"On the use of isoflurane versus halothane in the study of visual response properties of single cells in the primary visual cortex.","Halothane is a widely used anesthetic in research. It produces several alterations in organs, especially in the brain. Recently, isoflurane emerged in neuroscience laboratories. For many reasons it appears to be better than halothane for animal brain research (e.g. isoflurane induces lower intracranial pressure, and is less detrimental on the cardiovascular system). However, no one is in a position to recommend it in electrophysiology research because its effects on specific brain functions are relatively unknown. Given that both anesthetics yield different actions on gross brain activity (EEG, VEP), it is likely that they differentially affect single neuron activity. The goal of this study is to determine whether halothane or isoflurane use is best suited to study the receptive field properties of neurons in the cat's primary visual cortex. Extra-cellular recordings were made for both anesthetics in area 17 of adult cats under different levels of anesthesia. Results indicate that various cell parameters differ under halothane anesthesia when compared with isoflurane. The main difference between the two anesthetics is the greater depression of the cell optimal visual response amplitude induced by isoflurane at equipotent concentration. Due to its stronger depressive effects, isoflurane may not be the ideal anesthetic for single-cell recordings in the primary visual cortex.","Journal of neuroscience methods","12951229",2003,"Netherlands"
"Cell swelling activates cloned Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels: a role for the F-actin cytoskeleton.","Cloned Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of intermediate (hIK) or small (rSK3) conductance were expressed in HEK 293 cells, and channel activity was monitored using whole-cell patch clamp. hIK and rSK3 currents already activated by intracellular calcium were further increased by 95% and 125%, respectively, upon exposure of the cells to a 33% decrease in extracellular osmolarity. hIK and rSK3 currents were inhibited by 46% and 32%, respectively, by a 50% increase in extracellular osmolarity. Cell swelling and channel activation were not associated with detectable increases in [Ca(2+)](i), evidenced by population and single-cell measurements. In addition, inhibitors of IK and SK channels significantly reduced the rate of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in cells expressing these channels. Cell swelling induced a decrease, and cell shrinkage an increase, in net cellular F-actin content. The swelling-induced activation of hIK channels was strongly inhibited by cytochalasin D (CD), in concentrations that caused depolymerization of F-actin filaments, indicating a role for the F-actin cytoskeleton in modulation of hIK by changes in cell volume. In conclusion, hIK and rSK3 channels are activated by cell swelling and inhibited by shrinkage. A role for the F-actin cytoskeleton in the swelling-induced activation of hIK channels is suggested.","Biochimica et biophysica acta","12948593",2003,"Netherlands"
"Ketamine blocks Ca2+-activated K+ channels in rabbit cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells.","Although ketamine and Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels have been implicated in the contractile activity regulation of cerebral arteries, no studies have addressed the specific interactions between ketamine and the KCa channels in cerebral arteries. The purpose of this study was to examine the direct effects of ketamine on KCa channel activities using the patch-clamp technique in single-cell preparations of rabbit middle cerebral arterial smooth muscle. We tested the hypothesis that ketamine modulates the KCa channel activity of the cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells of the rabbit. Vascular myocytes were isolated from rabbit middle cerebral arteries using enzymatic dissociation. Single KCa channel activities of smooth muscle cells from rabbit cerebral arteries were recorded using the patch-clamp technique. In the inside-out patches, ketamine in the micromolar range inhibited channel activity with a half-maximal inhibition of the ketamine concentration value of 83.8 +/- 12.9 microM. The Hill coefficient was 1.2 +/- 0.3. The slope conductance of the current-voltage relationship was 320.1 +/- 2.0 pS between 0 and +60 mV in the presence of ketamine and symmetrical 145 mM K+. Ketamine had little effect on either the voltage-dependency or open- and closed-time histograms of KCa channel. The present study clearly demonstrates that ketamine inhibits KCa channel activities in rabbit middle cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells. This inhibition of KCa channels may represent a mechanism for ketamine-induced cerebral vasoconstriction.","American journal of physiology.

"Coupling of cardiac electrical activity over extended distances by fibroblasts of cardiac origin.","Roughly half of the cells of the heart consist of nonmyocardial cells, with fibroblasts representing the predominant cell type. It is well established that individual cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in culture establish gap junctional communication at the single cell level (short-range interaction). However, it is not known whether such coupling permits activation of cardiac tissue over extended distances (long-range interaction). Long-range interactions may be responsible for electrical synchronization of donor and recipient tissue after heart transplantation and may play a role in arrhythmogenesis. This question was investigated using a novel heterocellular culture model with strands of cardiomyocytes interrupted by cardiac fibroblasts over defined distances. With use of optical recording techniques, it could be shown that impulse propagation along fibroblast inserts was successful over distances up to 300 microm and was characterized by length-dependent local propagation delays ranging from 11 to 68 ms (apparent local &quot;conduction velocities&quot; 4.6+/-1.8 mm/s, n=23). Involvement of mechanical stretch in this phenomenon was excluded by showing that inserts consisting of communication-deficient HeLa cells were incapable of supporting propagation. In contrast, HeLa cells expressing connexin43 permitted impulse conduction over distances as long as 600 microm. Immunocytochemistry showed that fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes expressed connexin43 and connexin45, whereas connexin40 was absent. These results illustrate that fibroblasts of cardiac origin are capable of synchronizing electrical activity of multicellular cardiac tissue over extended distances through electrotonic interactions. This synchronization is accompanied by extremely large local conduction delays, which might contribute to the generation of arrhythmias in fibrotic hearts.","Circulation research","12893743",2003,"United States"
"Pharmacological characterization of micropatterned cardiac myocytes.","The cardiac myocytes patterned on a single cell level were prepared by microcontact printing, and the response to chemical stimuli was studied using confocal fluorescent Ca(2+) imaging. The patterned myocytes were found to conjugate by forming gap junction. It was confirmed for the patterned myocytes that gap junction communication was reversibly inhibited by 1-octanol, but activated by caffeine. Localized stimulation with chemicals was also attempted using a microinjection system for the myocyte patterns formed by single cell alignment. This research was carried out with the objective of developing a bioassay system based on a cellular network.","Biomaterials","12853255",2003,"Netherlands"
"Peroxidation of docosahexaenoic acid is responsible for its effects on I TO and I SS in rat ventricular myocytes.","1 Exposure to docosahexaeno<U+00EF>c acid (DHA), a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, is known to block several ionic currents such as the transient outward current I(TO). It has also been reported to activate certain potassium channels. It has been suggested that these effects, observed in single-cell experiments, participate in the antiarrhythmic properties of these compounds in vivo. 2 DHA is highly prone to peroxidation. To investigate the influence peroxidation may have on the effects of DHA on ion channels, we studied I(TO) and the steady-state outward current I(SS) in isolated rat ventricular myocytes under ruptured whole-cell patch-clamp conditions. 3 A measure of 10 micro M DHA alone reduced I(TO), evoked by a pulse to +70 mV, by 74.8+/-10.8% (n=7) and activated a delayed outward current with kinetic properties different from I(SS). 4 When an antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (1 micro M), was added together with DHA, the blockade of I(TO) was reduced to 38.5+/-7.7% (n=8) and the delayed outward current was not activated. alpha-Tocopherol alone had no effect on these currents. 5 When an oxidant, hydrogen peroxide (1 micro M), was applied together with DHA, the blockade of I(TO) was almost complete (98.4+/-1.0%, n=7) and a large delayed outward current was activated. A measure of 1 micro M hydrogen peroxide alone had no effect on these currents. 6 Measurements of nonperoxidized DHA in experimental solutions confirmed the negative relation between DHA concentration and the effects on the currents. 7 We conclude that rather than DHA itself, it is the peroxidation products of DHA that block I(TO) and activate a delayed outward current in in vitro single-cell experiments. These findings have important implications for the extrapolation of in vitro experimental findings to the antiarrhythmic effects of DHA in vivo because, in vivo, peroxidation of DHA is unlikely to occur.","British journal of pharmacology","12813005",2003,"England"
"[The medicine of nurturing life energy--health creation and self-organization].","It is reality that human's body and mind are being created by life energy through every moment of life. As modern medicine does not consider this life energy itself, the most modern people hardly does not think it's intuitive meaning and use it to actualize their health and happiness in life. They can consider the outcome of life phenomena in the fields of physical, psychological, sociological and ethical sides, but they can not ask what life energy is, and subsequently can not use it in their life. Therefore, they live to make effort to actualize how to change life style considering of medical scientific facts (Evidence-Based-Medical Health Care). The intuitive life's action which can contact with the outer worlds, has the dynamic relationship with them and it creates new body and mind continuously. Modern medicine has not researched this dynamic life energy itself. What has life energy, single gene, single cell, single organ such as the brain and heart and single human beings, have been maintained their life by using their common and universal two life energies which are called self-organization, self-creativity and communicative ability.

"The role of cardiac tissue structure in defibrillation.","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between cardiac tissue structure, applied electric field, and the transmembrane potential induced in the process of defibrillation. It outlines a general understanding of the structural mechanisms that contribute to the outcome of a defibrillation shock. Electric shocks defibrillate by changing the transmembrane potential throughout the myocardium. In this process first and foremost the shock current must access the bulk of myocardial mass. The exogenous current traverses the myocardium along convoluted intracellular and extracellular pathways channeled by the tissue structure. Since individual fibers follow curved pathways in the heart, and the fiber direction rotates across the ventricular wall, the applied current perpetually engages in redistribution between the intra- and extracellular domains. This redistribution results in changes in transmembrane potential (membrane polarization): regions of membrane hyper- and depolarization of extent larger than a single cell are induced in the myocardium by the defibrillation shock. Tissue inhomogeneities also contribute to local membrane polarization in the myocardium which is superimposed over the large-scale polarization associated with the fibrous organization of the myocardium. The paper presents simulation results that illustrate various mechanisms by which cardiac tissue structure assists the changes in transmembrane potential throughout the myocardium.

"The long QT interval is not only inherited but is also linked to cardiac hypertrophy.","This review focuses on the molecular determinants of the duration of the QT interval as measured on by electrocardiography in normal subjects and during cardiac hypertrophy and failure. (a) In control conditions, on a single cell, the shape and duration of the action potential is the result of a balance between different ion currents which in turn were determined by the number of functional channels. On multicellular preparations the QT duration also represents the repolarization time; nevertheless it is modified by the transmural gradients. On body-surface electrocardiography the duration of the QT interval depends also of an additional factor: the spatial three-dimensional projection of the electrical waves vectors, which makes any determination of the epicardial dispersion by measuring QT interval dispersion questionable. (b) The enhanced action potential duration is well documented in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure and is usually caused by a reduction in outward current densities in most of the species except mice. Among these currents I(tO) is the most frequently altered, especially in humans. Such an altered current density is caused by a diminished expression of the genes encoding either the ion channel subunits or regulatory proteins, such as KChIP2. In addition, hypertrophy modifies or even reverses the transmural gradient. In human and rats hypertensive cardiopathy is associated with a prolongation of the QT interval duration. The reduction in I(tO) is likely to be adaptive; it participates in the slowing of the cardiac cycle and reflects the fetal genetic reprogramming. Recent data also suggest that a reduction in the transient outward K(+) current density triggers protein synthesis through an activation of the calcineurin pathways. Thus a prolongation of the QT interval is not only inherited or drug-induced; it is also an essential component of the adaptive process in chronic mechanical overload. It is fundamentally incorrect to measure QT dispersion on a surface electrocardiography, but the mean QT interval may provide information concerning the progression of the disease, just as, and with the same restrictions, in the case of the quantification of V(max).","Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)","12750820",2003,"Germany"
"Stretch-induced excitation and action potential changes of single cardiac cells.","Mechanoelectric coupling (MEC) has been studied extensively in the heart at the tissue and organ levels, but to only a limited extent in single cells because of the technical challenges. New results are presented in which MEC was studied in 57 single frog ventricular myocytes that were held on both ends by glass holding pipettes. Axial stretch was applied either by displacement of the pipettes, or by a glass fiber around which the cell was wrapped, that was displaced in a pulsatile or sinusoidal fashion. Electrical activity of the cell was monitored either by active contraction, by intracellular action potentials, or by focal extracellular potentials. Of more than 350 stretches applied to 57 cells with amplitudes ranging from 3% to 35%, only 4 cases of mechanically induced stimulation were observed. In 252 stretches applied to 32 cells in which action potential duration (APD) was measured, no change &gt;20% was observed, except in 3 cells in which APD increased by &gt;100%, and in 2 cells with extended triggered activity. Thus, in contrast to studies in intact tissue, single frog ventricular myocytes are generally insensitive to direct axial stretch. However, robust mechanosensitive responses were observed in 7 of 57 ( approximately 12%) cells. The results of other single cell studies are reviewed, and the significance of differences in tissue-level and single cell results is discussed.","Progress in biophysics and molecular biology","12732271",2003,"United States"
"Patch-clamp studies of human cardiac ion channels in the evaluation of cardiac electrophysiological effects of compounds.","Drugs prolonging the QT interval appear to consistently inhibit the outward, rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) conveyed by the HERG channel. Hence, for determining whether a new drug candidate blocks the latter channel, this unit presents a basic electrophysiology protocol to conduct patch clamp studies in single cell preparations expressing heterologously cloned HERG channels. An additional protocol details the isolation of myocytes from specimens of human atria which are used in the study of native cardiac ion currents (INa, ICa, Ito, Isus, IK1). The results of these tests are useful for determining whether drug candidates have the desired cardiac safety profile for human use.","Current protocols in pharmacology","21956800",2003,"United States"

"Activation of Akt is essential for acetylcholine to trigger generation of oxygen free radicals.","OBJECTIVES: Acetylcholine (ACh) receptor activation in the heart causes mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is dependent on mitochondrial K(ATP) channel opening. Recent data show that Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is phosphorylated at its activation site following exposure to ACh. However, since no reliable Akt inhibitor is available, it has not been possible to determine whether Akt activation is an actual step in the protective pathway.METHODS: Cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5) were transiently transfected with a dominant negative Akt (Akt-AAA), thus inhibiting the ability of ACh in these cells to phosphorylate Akt. Transfected cells were identified by co-transfection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). ROS production was determined by incubating the cells for 15 min with 1 mM reduced MitoTracker Red which becomes fluorescent only after reacting with ROS. Cells were then triple-washed to remove any voltage-dependent pool of dye and single cell fluorescence was measured.RESULTS: ACh exposure (2 mM) led to a 1.64+/-0.15-fold increase in the average fluorescence over that seen in untreated cells (P=0.002). A similar increase in ROS production occurred after treatment with either the K(ATP) channel opener diazoxide (DIAZ) or the potassium ionophore valinomycin (VAL). Akt-AAA transfection abolished ACh-induced ROS production, but not increased ROS production after treatment with either DIAZ or VAL.CONCLUSION: Thus, at least in the smooth muscle cell model, Akt phosphorylation is an important step in the signal transduction pathway leading from ACh receptor activation to the generation of ROS. The experiments reveal that Akt is positioned between the receptor and the K(ATP) channel in this model.","Cardiovascular research","12667962",2003,"United States"
"A polycystin-2-like large conductance cation channel in rat left ventricular myocytes.","OBJECTIVE: Several members of the PKD gene family (PKD2, PKDL and PKD2L2) are expressed in the heart. Polycystin-2 and its homologues, which are encoded by these genes, have recently been shown to form Ca(2+)-regulated nonselective cation channels in heterologous expression systems. Previously, large conductance nonselective cation channels (LCC) have been described in cardiomyocytes, however, their molecular identity remained obscure. We therefore examined whether LCCs may be formed by polycystins.METHODS: Myocytes isolated from the rat left ventricle were investigated by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and single-cell RT-PCR.RESULTS: Application of 10 mM caffeine to the bath solution to increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration led to activation of LCC in 56% of the myocytes investigated (total n=651), in approximately 10%, more than three LCCs were detected. The single channel conductance was approximately 300 pS for monovalent cations and the channel was relatively nonselective for the monovalent cations Na(+), K(+), Li(+), and Cs(+) and also permeable for the divalent cations Ca(2+) and Ba(2+), but impermeable for NMDG(+) and Cl(-). Amiloride (IC(50)=131+/-1.1 microM) and millimolar concentrations of the trivalent cations Gd(3+) and La(3+) inhibited the LCC. Single-cell RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNA of PKD2 and PKD2L2, but not PKDL or PKD1 are expressed in individual rat left ventricular myocytes.CONCLUSION: The characteristics of LCC shown in the present study are nearly identical to those observed for polycystin-2 and its homologues suggesting that polycystin-2 or polycystin-2L2 underlie LCC in ventricular myocytes.","Cardiovascular research","12667948",2003,"England"

"Pulsed local-field fluorescence microscopy: a new approach for measuring cellular signals in the beating heart.","In cardiac research, single-cell experimental models have been extensively used to study the molecular mechanisms of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. The results of these studies are usually extrapolated to the tissue level assuming that the phenomena studied at the cellular level are either similar in the intact organ, or only slightly modified by variables that exist at the whole-heart level. The validity of these assumptions has rarely been confirmed experimentally. Common obstacles associated with the study of intracellular Ca(2+) signals in beating hearts include motion artifacts and spatio-temporal limitations of the recording system. In this work, action potentials and intracellular Ca(2+) signals were measured in beating hearts from young rats, with spatio-temporal resolutions similar to cellular studies using a novel pulsed local-field fluorescence technique. This method was based on maximizing emitted fluorescence to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The fluorescence emission of the indicator molecules was synchronized with brief (&lt;1 ns), high-power (400 W) laser pulses, and the common mode noise of the fluorescence signal was differentially cancelled. To follow rapidly evolving signals, a highly sensitive and fast detection system was used (10 kHz). The spatial resolution was improved using a small (50-200 microm diameter) multimode fiberoptic. Mechanical artifacts were effectively reduced by inserting the fiberoptic into a &quot;floating&quot; glass micropipette sealed to the heart wall with negative pressure. Our results demonstrate that local-field fluorescence microscopy offers an outstanding experimental approach for studying physiological signals at the whole-organ level with the high spatio-temporal resolution common to normal cellular approaches.","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","12632197",2003,"United States"
"Transdifferentiation of blood-derived human adult endothelial progenitor cells into functionally active cardiomyocytes.","BACKGROUND: Further to promoting angiogenesis, cell therapy may be an approach for cardiac regeneration. Recent studies suggest that progenitor cells can transdifferentiate into other lineages. However, the transdifferentiation potential of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: EPCs were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy adults or coronary artery disease (CAD) patients by cultivating with endothelial cell medium and growth factors. After 3 days, &gt;95% of adherent cells were functionally and phenotypically EPCs. Diacetylated LDL-labeled EPCs were then cocultivated with rat cardiomyocytes for 6 days, resulting in significant increases of EPC cell length and size to a cardiomyocyte-like morphology. Biochemically, 9.94+/-1.39% and 5.04+/-1.09% of EPCs from healthy adults (n=15) or CAD patients (n=14, P&lt;0.01 versus healthy adults), respectively, expressed alpha-sarcomeric actinin as measured by flow cytometry. Immunocytochemistry showed that human EPCs expressed alpha-sarcomeric actinin, cardiac troponin I (both with partial sarcomeric organization), atrial natriuretic peptide, and myocyte enhancer factor 2. Fluo 4 imaging demonstrated calcium transients synchronized with adjacent rat cardiomyocytes in transdifferentiated human EPCs. Single-cell microinjection of Lucifer yellow and calcein-AM labeling of cardiomyocytes demonstrated gap junctional communication between 51+/-7% of EPCs (16 hours after labeling, n=4) and cardiomyocytes. EPC transdifferentiation into cardiomyocytes was not observed with conditioned medium but in coculture with paraformaldehyde-fixed cardiomyocytes.CONCLUSIONS: EPCs from healthy volunteers and CAD patients can transdifferentiate in vitro into functionally active cardiomyocytes when cocultivated with rat cardiomyocytes. Cell-to-cell contact but not cellular fusion mediates EPC transdifferentiation. The therapeutic use of autologous EPCs may aid cardiomyocyte regeneration in patients with ischemic heart disease.","Circulation","12600917",2003,"United States"
"Elevated glucose inhibits VEGF-A-mediated endocardial cushion formation: modulation by PECAM-1 and MMP-2.","Atrioventricular (AV) septal defects resulting from aberrant endocardial cushion (EC) formation are observed at increased rates in infants of diabetic mothers. EC formation occurs via an epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), involving transformation of endocardial cells into mesenchymal cells, migration, and invasion into extracellular matrix. Here, we report that elevated glucose inhibits EMT by reducing myocardial vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). This effect is reversed with exogenous recombinant mouse VEGF-A165, whereas addition of soluble VEGF receptor-1 blocks EMT. We show that disruption of EMT is associated with persistence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression. These findings correlate with retention of a nontransformed endocardial sheet and lack of invasion. The MMP inhibitor GM6001 blocks invasion, whereas explants from PECAM-1 deficient mice exhibit MMP-2 induction and normal EMT in high glucose. PECAM-1-negative endothelial cells are highly motile and express more MMP-2 than do PECAM-1-positive endothelial cells. During EMT, loss of PECAM-1 similarly promotes single cell motility and MMP-2 expression. Our findings suggest that high glucose-induced inhibition of AV cushion morphogenesis results from decreased myocardial VEGF-A expression and is, in part, mediated by persistent endocardial cell PECAM-1 expression and failure to up-regulate MMP-2 expression.","The Journal of cell biology","12591918",2003,"United States"
"The effect of oxidative stress on histone acetylation and IL-8 release.","Acetylation of histone residues regulates the expression of inflammatory genes and is controlled by the activities of histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC). Analysis of histone acetylation in human cells is limited by the large numbers needed to perform activity assays or Western blotting. We have used flow cytometry to investigate changes in HAT and HDAC activities at the single cell level and to investigate the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on histone H4 acetylation and cell-cycle progression. Using an anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody we show that H(2)O(2) induced a time-dependent increase in histone acetylation that was maintained for 12h. This was associated with increased IL-8 production. H(2)O(2) also affected cell-cycle progression. HAT activity was found to be highest in G2/M and equivalent in G0/G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. These data show that detection of acetylated histone residues at the single cell level using FACs may be a powerful new tool for the analysis of modulation of cell proliferation and gene transcription.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","12565901",2003,"United States"
"Altered single cell force-velocity and power properties in exercise-trained rat myocardium.","Myocardial function is enhanced by endurance exercise training, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this improved function remain unclear. The ability of the myocardium to perform external work is a critical aspect of ventricular function, but previous studies of myocardial adaptation to exercise training have been limited to measurements of isometric tension or unloaded shortening velocity, conditions in which work output is zero. We measured force-velocity properties in single permeabilized myocyte preparations to determine the effect of exercise training on loaded shortening and power output. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sedentary control (C) and exercise trained (T) groups. T rats underwent 11 wk of progressive treadmill exercise. Myocytes were isolated from T and C hearts, chemically skinned, and attached to a force transducer. Shortening velocity was determined during loaded contractions at 15 degrees C by using a force-clamp technique. Power output was calculated by multiplying force times velocity values. We found that unloaded shortening velocity was not significantly different in T vs. C myocytes (T = 1.43 muscle lengths/s, n = 46 myocytes; C = 1.12 muscle lengths/s, n = 43 myocytes). Training increased the velocity of loaded shortening and increased peak power output (peak power = 0.16 P/P(o) x muscle length/s for T myocytes; peak power = 0.10 P/P(o) x muscle length/s for C myocytes, where P/P(o) is relative tension). We found no effect of training on myosin heavy chain isoform content. These results suggest that training alters power output properties of single cardiac myocytes and that this adaptation may improve the work capacity of the myocardium.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","12524379",2003,"United States"
"Ablation of telomerase and telomere loss leads to cardiac dilatation and heart failure associated with p53 upregulation.","Cardiac failure is a frequent cause of death in the aging human population. Telomere attrition occurs with age, and is proposed to be causal for the aging process. To determine whether telomere shortening leads to a cardiac phenotype, we studied heart function in the telomerase knockout mouse, Terc-/-. We studied Terc-/- mice at the second, G2, and fifth, G5, generation. Telomere shortening in G2 and G5 Terc-/- mice was coupled with attenuation in cardiac myocyte proliferation, increased apoptosis and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. On a single-cell basis, telomere shortening was coincidental with increased expression of p53, indicating the presence of dysfunctional telomeres in cardiac myocytes from G5 Terc-/- mice. The impairment in cell division, the enhanced cardiac myocyte death and cellular hypertrophy, are concomitant with ventricular dilation, thinning of the wall and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, inhibition of cardiac myocyte replication provoked by telomere shortening, results in de-compensated eccentric hypertrophy and heart failure in mice. Telomere shortening with age could also contribute to cardiac failure in humans, opening the possibility for new therapies.","The EMBO journal","12505991",2002,"United States"
"Anesthesia of fish with benzocaine does not interfere with comet assay results.","Fish blood erythrocytes are frequently used as sentinels in biomonitoring studies. Usually, fish blood is collected by painful cardiac or caudal vein punctures. Previous anesthesia could decrease animal suffering but it is not known at present whether anesthesia can cause confounding effects. Therefore, using the alkaline single cell gel (SCG)/comet assay with blood erythrocytes of the cichlid fish Nile tilapia, we tested for a possible modulation of induced DNA damage (methyl methanesulfonate; MMS) by the anesthetic benzocaine administered by bath exposure (80mg/l for approximately 10min). Furthermore, benzocaine (80-600mg/l) was tested for its genotoxic potential on fish erythrocytes in vitro and for potential interactions with two known genotoxins (MMS and hydrogen peroxide). Our results did neither indicate a significant increase in the amount of DNA damage (even after a 48h follow-up), nor indicated interactions with MMS-induced DNA damage when fish were exposed to benzocaine in vivo. There was also no increase in DNA damage after in vitro exposure of fish erythrocytes to benzocaine. Clear concentration-related effects were observed for the two genotoxins in vitro, which were not significantly altered by the presence of benzocaine. These results suggest that anesthesia of fish does not confound comet assay results and the use of blood samples from anesthetized fish can be recommended with regard to animal welfare.","Mutation research","12504765",2002,"Netherlands"
"ERG K+ channel blockade enhances firing and epinephrine secretion in rat chromaffin cells: the missing link to LQT2-related sudden death?","The ether-a-go-go-related genes (erg) are expressed in tissues other than heart and brain, in which human erg (HERG) K+ channels are known to regulate the repolarization of heart action potentials and neuronal spike-frequency accommodation. We provide evidence that erg1 transcripts and ERG proteins are present in rat chromaffin cells in which we could isolate a K+ current that was biophysically and pharmacologically similar to the ERG current. Firing frequency and catecholamine release were analyzed at the single-cell level by means of perforated patch-clamp and carbon fiber electrochemical detection. It was found that the blocking of ERG, KATP, and KCa channels led to hyperexcitability and an increase in catecholamine release. Combined immunocytochemical experiments with antibodies directed against phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and ERG channels suggested expression of these channels in epinephrine- but not in norepinephrine-containing cells. It is concluded that, in addition to being crucial in regulating the QT period in the heart, ERG channels play a role in modulating epinephrine, a fundamental neurotransmitter shaping cardiac function. This finding suggests that the sudden death phenotype associated with LQT2 syndrome mutations may be the result of an emotionally triggered increase in epinephrine in a long-QT running heart.","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","12490549",2002,"Italy"
"Effect of nitric oxide on excitatory amino acid-evoked discharge of neurons in NTS.","N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor subtypes are involved in the integration of visceral afferent inputs within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Microinjection studies indicate interactions between nitric oxide (NO) and EAA receptors within the NTS. To examine these interactions at the single cell level, this study characterized the effects of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and the NO donor 3-[2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazino]-1-propanamine (PAPA-NONOate) on the excitatory responses of vagus nerve (VN)-evoked NTS neurons to the activation of (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors in rats. Iontophoresis of l-NAME did not alter spontaneous or VN-evoked discharges, but significantly decreased the number of action potentials (APs) evoked by iontophoretic application of AMPA. The effects of l-NAME on NMDA-evoked discharge were variable; for the population, l-NAME did not change the number of APs evoked by NMDA. PAPA-NONOate enhanced the spontaneous discharge and the number of APs elicited by AMPA but not NMDA. Iontophoresis of the inactive enantiomers N(G)-nitro-d-arginine methyl ester and hydroxydiazenesulfonic acid 1-oxide disodium salt had no effect on AMPA-evoked discharge. Our data suggest that NO facilitates AMPA-mediated neuronal transmission within the NTS.","American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology","12485819",2002,"United States"
"Embryonal cardiotoxicity of the Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide.","Helicobacter (H.) pylori is the causative agent of the peptic ulcer disease and a co-factor in the development of gastric malignancies. Recently, it has been maintained that chronic H. pylori infections in adults are linked to a higher risk of coronary heart diseases. In this respect, the acute toxic effects of the H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on embryonal cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages was evaluated. White Leghorn chick embryos and smooth (S)--form NCTC 11637 strain H. pylori organisms were used. Both whole heath-killed H. pylori suspensions (3.10(6) bacteria/egg) and isolated S-LPS (500 ng/egg) or S-Lipid A (500 ng/egg) were non-lethal to 4-day embryos, becoming moderately lethal (5% to 30%) to 6- and 8-day embryos and highly lethal (&gt; 90%) to 10- to 17-day embryos. The contractile activity of isolated atrial fragments from 10-day embryos was completely inhibited, within 5 min, following treatments with heath-killed H. pylori (3 x 10(6)/ml), or S-LPS (500 ng/ml), or S-Lipid A (500 ng/ml); the block determined by S-LPS and S-Lipid A was irreversible, while the block by bacterial suspensions was completely reversible upon withdrawal. Following a 24-hour treatment with S-LPS or S-Lipid A of single-cell cultures of cardiomyocytes (isolated from 10-day embryos) a dose-dependent cell loss was observed, as assessed by total protein dosage and direct counting of adherent cells. Propidium Iodide/Annexin V FACS-analysis confirmed the occurrence of cellular necrosis, but did not show any evidence of apoptotic processes. The release of superoxide anion radicals by cultured cardiomyocytes was as follows: S-Lipid A (25 micrograms/ml) &gt; S-LPS (25 micrograms/ml) &gt; heath killed H. pylori suspensions (3 x 10(6)/ml); control cultures did not release detectable amounts of superoxide anion radicals. Furthermore, cultured cardiomyocytes produced increased amounts of NO (N-monomethylarginine-inhibitable) following stimulation with S-LPS (25 micrograms/ml) or S-Lipid A (25 micrograms/ml) (but not heath killed H. pylori 3 x 10(6)/ml suspensions). Under all the above experimental conditions S-polysaccharide proved to be non-toxic. Concluding, H. pylori LPS is relatively non-toxic to the less differentiated cardiomyocytes; cardiomyocytes which are more advanced in their biochemical differentiation become highly sensitive to LPS and produce ROS and NO. ROS are probably responsible for the early toxic actions, while both ROS and NO are likely to be involved in the later degenerative/necrotic effects.","Current drug targets.

"Single-cell analysis: a novel approach to tumour necrosis factor-alpha synthesis and secretion in sarcoidosis.","Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is thought to be a key early cytokine in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis, despite conflicting data. Largely the product of mononuclear phagocyte activation, it is unclear whether TNF-alpha production at disease sites is a feature of all mononuclear phagocytes that accumulate there or whether it is secreted by a subset of these cells. Using the reverse haemolytic plaque assay, the aims of this study were to determine if the upregulation of TNF-alpha could be confirmed and to investigate whether this was monocyte or macrophage specific. The reverse haemolytic plaque assay allows the measurement of cytokine production at a single cell level. A greater number of alveolar macrophages produced TNF-alpha compared to autologous monocytes in sarcoidosis but not in controls and, based on cell size, it was confirmed that this was the product of more mature macrophages and that the secretion of TNF-alpha by monocytes and macrophages was heterogeneous: not all monocytes and macrophages secrete TNF-alpha. No differences in the average levels of TNF-alpha secretion by peripheral blood monocytes or alveolar macrophages were observed. This study has demonstrated that a subset of mononuclear phagocytes, mature macrophages, are responsible for tumour necrosis factor secretion and this could have implications for targeted management in sarcoidosis in the future.","The European respiratory journal","12449172",2002,"England"
"Cardiac pacemaker mechanisms in the ostracod crustacean Vargula hilgendorfii.","The heart of the ostracod crustacean Vargula hilgendorfii has a single intrinsic neuron that morphologically appears to innervate the myocardium. We, therefore, examined the heart activity electrophysiologically to determine whether the heartbeat is neurogenic. Each heartbeat is associated with a myocardial action potential composed of a spike potential followed by a plateau potential. The frequency of the action potential is not stable but changes successively over a wide range. The action potential is not preceded by a pacemaker potential and has an inflection in its rising phase. The myocardial cells couple electrically and fire almost simultaneously. The frequency of the action potential was unchanged by injection of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current into the myocardium. However, slow oscillatory potentials appeared during the depolarization and its frequency was higher with increasing current intensity. Application of 1-microM tetrodotoxin (TTX) depolarized the myocardial membrane and completely prevented the action potential. During this depolarization, slow oscillatory potentials often appeared spontaneously. These results suggest that, although the myocardium has a property of conditional oscillator, the heartbeat is driven by the single cell cardiac ganglion that has both pacemaker and motor functions.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

"Syntrophin gamma 2 regulates SCN5A gating by a PDZ domain-mediated interaction.","SCN5A encodes the alpha subunit of the cardiac muscle and intestinal smooth muscle mechanosensitive Na(+) channel. Mechanosensitivity in the intestine requires an intact cytoskeleton. We report, using laser capture microdissection, single cell PCR, and immunohistochemistry, that syntrophins, scaffolding proteins, were expressed in human intestinal smooth muscle cells. The distribution of syntrophin gamma 2 was similar to that of SCN5A. Yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments show that SCN5A and syntrophin gamma 2 co-express and that the PDZ domain of syntrophin gamma 2 directly interacts with the C terminus of SCN5A. In native cells, disruption of the C terminus-syntrophin gamma 2 PDZ domain interaction using peptides directed against either region result in loss of mechanosensitivity. Co-transfection of syntrophin gamma 2 with SCN5A in HEK293 cells markedly shifts the activation kinetics of SCN5A and reduces the availability of Na(+) current. We propose that syntrophin gamma 2 is an essential Na(+) channel-interacting protein required for the full expression of the Na(+) current and that the SCN5A-syntrophin gamma 2 interaction determines mechanosensitivity and current availability.","The Journal of biological chemistry","12429735",2002,"United States"
"Pathophysiological effects of radiation on atherosclerosis development and progression, and the incidence of cardiovascular complications.","Radiation therapy while important in the management of several diseases, is implicated in the causation of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular complications. Cancer and atherosclerosis go through the same stages of initiation, promotion, and complication, beginning with a mutation in a single cell. Clinical observations before the 1960s lead to the belief that the heart is relatively resistant to the doses of radiation used in radiotherapy. Subsequently, it was discovered that the heart is sensitive to radiation and many cardiac structures may be damaged by radiation exposure. A significantly higher risk of death due to ischemic heart disease has been reported for patients treated with radiation for Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer. Certain cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-beta1 and IL-1 beta, may stimulate radiation-induced endothelial proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and fibrosis leading to advanced lesions of atherosclerosis. The treatment for radiation-induced ischemic heart disease includes conventional pharmacological therapy, balloon angioplasty, and bypass surgery. Endovascular irradiation has been shown to be effective in reducing restenosis-like response to balloon-catheter injury in animal models. Caution must be exercised when radiation therapy is combined with doxorubicin because there appears to be a synergistic toxic effect on the myocardium. Damage to endothelial cells is a central event in the pathogenesis of damage to the coronary arteries. Certain growth factors that interfere with the apoptotic pathway may provide new therapeutic strategies for reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to the heart. Exposure to low level occupational or environmental radiation appears to pose no undue risk of atherosclerosis development or cardiovascular mortality. But, other radiation-induced processes such as the bystander effects, abscopal effects, hormesis, and individual variations in radiosensitivity may be important in certain circumstances.","Medical physics","12408314",2002,"United States"
"Engraftment of human CD34+ cells leads to widespread distribution of donor-derived cells and correction of tissue pathology in a novel murine xenotransplantation model of lysosomal storage disease.","A novel murine system was developed to study the in vivo localization of xenotransplanted human cells and assess their therapeutic effect in an authentic model of disease. The beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) mutation of the mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPSVII) mouse was backcrossed onto the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) xenotransplantation strain. The resulting NOD/SCID/MPSVII mice displayed the characteristic features of lysosomal storage disease because of GUSB deficiency and were also capable of engrafting human cells. Human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from healthy, GUSB+ donors engrafted NOD/SCID/MPSVII mice in a manner similar to that of standard NOD/SCID mice. Six to 12 weeks following transplantation, 1% to 86% of the host bone marrow was positive for human CD45. By using a GUSB-specific histochemical assay, human engraftment was detected with single-cell sensitivity not only in well-characterized hematopoietic tissues like bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, and thymus, but also in other nonhematopoietic organs like liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain, and eye. Quantitative measurements of GUSB activity confirmed this expansive tissue distribution. The GUSB-specific assays were validated for their accuracy in identifying human cells through colocalization of human CD45 expression with GUSB activity in tissues of mice receiving transplants. An analysis of the therapeutic effects of engrafted human cells revealed a reduction of pathologic storage material in host organs, including the bone, spleen, and liver. Such xenotransplantation experiments in the NOD/SCID/MPSVII mouse represent a powerful approach to both study the in vivo biology of human cells and gather preclinical data regarding treatment approaches for a human disease.","Blood","12406886",2002,"United States"
"Exercise training attenuates coronary smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and nuclear Ca2+ signaling.","Physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, yet the mechanism(s) of exercise-related cardioprotection remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that coronary smooth muscle after exercise training would have decreased mitogen-induced phenotypic modulation and enhanced regulation of nuclear Ca(2+). Yucatan swine were endurance exercise trained (EX) on a treadmill for 16-20 wk. EX reduced endothelin-1-induced DNA content by 40% compared with sedentary (SED) swine (P &lt; 0.01). EX decreased single cell peak endothelin-1-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) responses compared with SED by 16% and peak nuclear Ca(2+) responses by 33% (P &lt; 0.05), as determined by confocal microscopy. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and intracellular Ca(2+) stores in native smooth muscle are spatially localized to dissociate cytosolic Ca(2+) and nuclear Ca(2+). Subcellular localization of SERCA in living and fixed cells revealed a distribution of SERCA near the sarcolemma and on the nuclear envelope. These results show that EX enhances nuclear Ca(2+) regulation, possibly via SERCA, which may be one mechanism by which coronary smooth muscle cells from EX are less responsive to mitogen-induced phenotypic modulation.","American journal of physiology.

"TNF-alpha downregulates vascular endothelial Flk-1 expression in human melanoma xenograft model.","High-dose TNF with melphalan has significant antitumor activity in regional perfusion of the limbs and liver in human malignancies. TNF is believed to target tumor vasculature, but the precise molecular mechanism is unknown. The present study demonstrates that TNF downregulates the VEGF receptor, fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1), on tumor endothelium in a human melanoma xenograft model. NIH1286 human melanoma cells were transduced with a 720-bp fragment of the human VEGF(121) gene to develop well-vascularized tumors that served as an amplified system for measuring Flk-1 expression changes. We injected 5 x 10(6) cells subcutaneously, each of two distinct single cell clones (NIH1286/3 and NIH1286/15), into athymic nude mice to produce tumors approximately 10 mm in size. Each animal then received either BSA or TNF in BSA by tail vein. Tumors harvested at different time points post-TNF were analyzed for Flk-1 mRNA and protein expression. Data obtained showed that intravascular TNF downregulated Flk-1 expression in tumor endothelial cells. This effect could contribute to the antitumor activity of TNF known to target tumor vasculature.","American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology","12388254",2002,"United States"
"Cardiac tissue engineering: characteristics of in unison contracting two- and three-dimensional neonatal rat ventricle cell (co)-cultures.","Patients with heart failure have, in spite of improved palliative therapies, bad prognosis. Cardiac tissue engineering by use of a temporary bioscaffold and cardiomyocytes may help to find answers for future treatments in heart failure. For that purpose two neonatal rat heart ventricular cell fractions were obtained after a gradient cell separation. Time related characteristics of Fractions I and II were established in two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) cell cultures. The 3-D cardiac constructs were obtained by use of a bovine type I collagen matrix after culturing either under static conditions or in the HARV bioreactor. With the 2-D cultures contracting cells were present after 1 day, and reached confluency from day 5 on and this was maintained up to 135 days. In Fraction-I some non-contracting cells were always noticed between the (in time in unison) contracting cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that these mainly concerned fibroblasts. Differences in the expression of alpha-SM-1 actin and troponin-T were observed between the two fractions. In both fractions endothelial cells and macrophages were only sporadically observed. All through the 3-D matrix pendant-like single cell and clustered cell contractions were present after 1-2 days, resulting in time in unison contracting of cells with the collagen matrices. The whole event was faster with Fraction-I and was observed up to 3 weeks. At this time point clusters of troponin-T positive cells were found scattered through the collagen matrices. Additionally, TEM revealed healthy layers of connected cardiomyocytes with intercalated discs, in this case on and in between the collagen fibres. These findings provide evidence that in unison contracting structurally organized cell-matrix cardiac constructs can be engineered by use of co-cultures (neonatal cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts) and collagen matrices, which is very promising for the repair of larger scar areas of the myocardium.","Biomaterials","12361618",2002,"Netherlands"
"Analysis of multineuronal activation patterns from calcium-imaging experiments in brain slices.","The patterns of cellular organization and intercellular communication in excitable tissues are extraordinarily complex. This article reviews a new set of tools for the imaging and statistical analysis of multicellular circuits in real time, and describes the findings from analysis of neuronal networks from slices of rodent neocortex loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators. Spontaneous activation of multineuronal networks was found to be generated by both synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms, and these cortical microcircuits have a precise spatial organization. In general, these techniques and methods of analysis, which can detect patterns of activity with single-cell and millisecond resolution, are applicable to the study of calcium and electrical signaling in cell populations of excitable tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and the nervous system.","Trends in cardiovascular medicine","12242047",2002,"United States"
"Heterogeneity of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptors in rat intrinsic cardiac neurons.","The expression of receptors for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was investigated in isolated parasympathetic neurons of neonatal rat intracardiac ganglia using single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Individual neurons were shown to express multiple isoforms of the PACAP receptor, PAC1, including PAC1-short, -HOP1 and -HOP2 variants, which differ in the region encoding the G protein-binding domain. The PAC1-HOP1 isoform was the predominant species, being expressed at higher levels and in a greater number of cells than other PAC1 variants. In addition to PAC1, intrinsic cardiac neurons express transcripts for the VIP receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, with VPAC2 being found in a greater proportion of the neurons. These findings may explain the complex effects of PACAP and VIP on neuroexcitability in mammalian intracardiac ganglia.","Neuroscience letters","12123856",2002,"United States"
"Clinical applications of laser scanning cytometry.","This study reviews existing and potential clinical applications of laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and outlines possible future developments. LSC provides a technology for solid phase cytometry. Fluorochrome-labeled specimens are immobilized on microscopic slides that are placed on a conventional epifluorescence microscope and analyzed by one or two lasers. Data comparable to flow cytometry are generated. In addition, the position of each event is recorded, a feature that allows relocalization and visualization of each measured event. The major advantage of LSC compared with other cytometric methods is the combination of two features: (a) the minimal clinical sample volume needed and (b) the connection of fluorescence data and morphological information for the measured event. Since the introduction of LSC, numerous methods have been established for the analysis of cells, cellular compartments, and tissues. Although most cytometric methods use only two or three colors, the characterization of specimens with up to five fluorochromes is possible. Most clinical applications have been designed to determine ploidy and immunophenotype; other applications include analyses of tissue biopsies and sections, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the combination of vital and nonvital information on a single-cell basis. With the currently available assays, LSC has proven its wide spectrum of clinical applicability in slide-based cytometry and can be introduced as a standard technology in multiple clinical settings.","Cytometry","12116336",2002,"United States"
"Sigma receptors inhibit high-voltage-activated calcium channels in rat sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.","Studies on the expression and cellular function of sigma receptors in autonomic neurons were conducted in neonatal rat intracardiac and superior cervical (SCG) ganglia. Individual neurons from SCG and intracardiac ganglia were shown to express transcripts encoding the sigma-1 receptor using single-cell RT-PCR techniques. The relationship between sigma receptors and calcium channels was studied in isolated neurons of these ganglia under voltage-clamp mode using the perforated-patch configuration of the whole cell patch-clamp recording technique. Bath application of sigma receptor agonists was shown to rapidly depress peak calcium channel currents in a reversible manner in both SCG and intracardiac ganglion neurons. The inhibition of barium (I(Ba)) currents was dose-dependent, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for haloperidol, ibogaine, (+)-pentazocine, and 1,3-Di-O-tolylguanidin (DTG) were 6, 31, 61, and 133 microM, respectively. The rank order potency of haloperidol &gt; ibogaine &gt; (+)-pentazocine &gt; DTG is consistent with the effects on calcium channels being mediated by a sigma-2 receptor. Preincubation of neurons with the irreversible sigma receptor antagonist, metaphit, blocked DTG-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ channel currents. Maximum inhibition of calcium channel currents was &gt; or =95%, suggesting that sigma receptors block all calcium channel subtypes found on the cell body of these neurons, which includes N-, L-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels. In addition to depressing peak Ca2+ channel current, sigma receptors altered the biophysical properties of these channels. Following sigma receptor activation, Ca2+ channel inactivation rate was accelerated, and the voltage dependence of both steady-state inactivation and activation shifted toward more negative potentials. Experiments on the signal transduction cascade coupling sigma receptors and Ca2+ channels demonstrated that neither cell dialysis nor intracellular application of 100 microM guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) trilithium salt (GDP-beta-S) abolished the modulation of I(Ba) by sigma receptor agonists. These data suggest that neither a diffusible cytosolic second messenger nor a G protein is involved in this pathway. Activation of sigma receptors on sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons is likely to modulate cell-to-cell signaling in autonomic ganglia and thus the regulation of cardiac function by the peripheral nervous system.","Journal of neurophysiology","12037190",2002,"United States"
"Stem cells in cardiovascular disease: from cell biology to clinical therapy.","Human life begins as a single fertilized cell. As adult human beings we are profoundly complex. This journey from single cell to complex being is attributable to the role of stem cells (i.e. cells that produce all the different types of cells and tissues that make up the human body). Recent interest has focused on the development of stem cells as a therapeutic option in the treatment of disease. Due to their ability both to replace and/or repair damaged tissue, stem cell therapy provides an ideal means to improve therapy for cardiac disorders associated with heart muscle injury. In particular, pre-clinical studies in animal models of acute myocardial infarction have shown great promise for both repairing damaged cardiac muscle and generating new blood vessel formation in the infarcted area. Stem-cell research therefore holds great therapeutic potential and is relevant, not only to basic science researchers, but also to clinicians (who may need to consider such cell-based therapy in the future) and to their patients.","Internal medicine journal","12036225",2002,"Australia"
"The meso-angioblast: a multipotent, self-renewing cell that originates from the dorsal aorta and differentiates into most mesodermal tissues.","We have previously reported the origin of a class of skeletal myogenic cells from explants of dorsal aorta. This finding disagrees with the known origin of all skeletal muscle from somites and has therefore led us to investigate the in vivo origin of these cells and, moreover, whether their fate is restricted to skeletal muscle, as observed in vitro under the experimental conditions used. To address these issues, we grafted quail or mouse embryonic aorta into host chick embryos. Donor cells, initially incorporated into the host vessels, were later integrated into mesodermal tissues, including blood, cartilage, bone, smooth, skeletal and cardiac muscle. When expanded on a feeder layer of embryonic fibroblasts, the clonal progeny of a single cell from the mouse dorsal aorta acquired unlimited lifespan, expressed hemo-angioblastic markers (CD34, Flk1 and Kit) at both early and late passages, and maintained multipotency in culture or when transplanted into a chick embryo. We conclude that these newly identified vessel-associated stem cells, the meso-angioblasts, participate in postembryonic development of the mesoderm, and we speculate that postnatal mesodermal stem cells may be derived from a vascular developmental origin.","Development (Cambridge, England)","12015303",2002,"Italy"
"Identification and expression of mouse Langerin (CD207) in dendritic cells.","We have cloned the mouse homologue of human Langerin (h-Langerin), a type II transmembrane protein with a single external C-type lectin domain. Mouse Langerin (m-Langerin) displays 65 and 74% homologies in total amino acid and lectin domains with those of h-Langerin. The cognate mouse and rat genes were assigned to chromosome 6D1-D2 and chromosome 4q33 distal-q34.1 proximal respectively, syntenic to the h-Langerin gene on chromosome 2p13. With RT-PCR, m-Langerin transcripts were as expected detected in MHC class II+, but not MHC class II-, cells from epidermis and the expression level was reduced by culture. However, m-Langerin transcripts were also expressed in spleen, lymph nodes (LN), thymus, liver, lung and even heart, but not gut-associated lymphoid tissues. In single-cell lymphoid suspensions, m-Langerin transcripts were mainly detected in the CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC), especially the CD11blow/CD8high fraction of spleen and LN. DC generated from bone marrow precursors by granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expressed m-Langerin, but this was shut down during maturation with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide. DC derived from blood monocytes by GM-CSF + IL-4 lacked m-Langerin unless the cultures were supplemented with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. Unexpectedly, significant amounts of m-Langerin transcripts were detected in skin and LN of TGF-beta1-deficient mice, although in much lower amounts than littermate controls. Recombinant m-Langerin could form multimers and bind to mannan-agarose. These findings indicate that Langerin expression is regulated at several levels: by TGF-beta1, DC subsets, DC maturation and the tissue environment.","International immunology","11978773",2002,"United States"
"Clonally expanded mtDNA point mutations are abundant in individual cells of human tissues.","Using single-cell sequence analysis, we discovered that a high proportion of cells in tissues as diverse as buccal epithelium and heart muscle contain high proportions of clonal mutant mtDNA expanded from single initial mutant mtDNA molecules. We demonstrate that intracellular clonal expansion of somatic point mutations is a common event in normal human tissues. This finding implies efficient homogenization of mitochondrial genomes within individual cells. Significant qualitative differences observed between the spectra of clonally expanded mutations in proliferating epithelial cells and postmitotic cardiomyocytes suggest, however, that either the processes generating these mutations or mechanisms driving them to homoplasmy are likely to be fundamentally different between the two tissues. Furthermore, the ability of somatic mtDNA mutations to expand (required for their phenotypic expression), as well as their apparently high incidence, reinforces the possibility that these mutations may be involved actively in various physiological processes such as aging and degenerative disease. The abundance of clonally expanded point mutations in individual cells of normal tissues also suggests that the recently discovered accumulation of mtDNA mutations in tumors may be explained by processes that are similar or identical to those operating in the normal tissue.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","11943860",2002,"United States"
"Oxidative DNA damage as a marker of aging in WI-38 human fibroblasts.","Cause-effect relationships between oxidative stress, DNA damage and aging were investigated in WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts at 21, 41 or 58 population doublings (PDs), corresponding to young, middle age or old fibroblasts, respectively. Oxidative DNA damage was evaluated by immunohistochemical detection of 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) adducts or by single cell microgel electrophoresis (COMET assay). Aging was evaluated by growth rate, senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta galactosidase) activity, cell cycle distribution, and expression of p21. Our results demonstrate that (i) oxidative DNA damage is proportional to the age of cells (ii) DNA damage in old/58 PDs cells reflects both an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, induced by acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and a reduced efficiency of repair mechanisms. We also show that mild chronic oxidative stress, induced by prolonged exposure to 5 microM H(2)O(2), accelerates aging in fibroblasts. In fact, this treatment increased 8-OHdG levels, SA-beta-galactosidase activity, and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in middle age/41 PDs, making them similar to H(2)O(2)-untreated old/58 PDs cells. Although other mechanisms may concur in mediating the effects of H(2)O(2), these results lend support to the concept that oxidative stress may be a key determinant of aging. Measurements of oxidative DNA damage might therefore be exploited as reliable marker of cellular aging.","Experimental gerontology","11909682",2002,"England"
"Negligible changes in piglet serum clinical indicators or organ weights due to dietary single-cell long-chain polyunsaturated oils.","Single-cell oils are currently included in human infant formula as sources of the long-chain polyunsaturates (LCP) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) in many countries, but have not yet been approved for use in the USA. We prepared four bovine-milk-based formulas with AA/DHA=0, 34/17, 68/34 and 170/85 (mg per 100 kcal formula) provided by two commercial single-cell oils. These levels correspond approximately to 0, 1, 2 and 5 times the concentrations used in infant formulas and, due to greater consumption of formula per unit body weight, resulted in daily consumption of approximately 0, 3, 6 and 16 times those anticipated for human infants. All other dietary fat (47% of calories) was provided by a vegetable oil blend used in commercial human infant formulas. Domestic piglets were allowed to nurse with the sow for 24 h after parturition, then removed to individual cages and maintained on one of the four diets. At 30 days of age the piglets were sacrificed, and serum collected and organs weighed. With litters treated as a blocked variable, no significant differences among groups were found by analysis of variance for the following serum assays: alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and total protein. No significant differences were found for hematocrit or body weight. No significant differences were found among groups for weights of liver, brain, heart, lung, spleen, kidneys or lung, analyzed as absolute weight and as a fraction of body weight. Hematoxylin/eosin liver sections examined by light microscopy showed no abnormalities as evaluated by an independent pathologist. DHA content in liver and heart and AA content in heart showed significant dose-related accumulation (P&lt;0.05) and confirmed enhanced tissue accretion of DHA and AA from both oils. We conclude that single-cell oils in formula consumed for 1 month in amounts up to 16-fold greater than proposed for human infants in the USA did not result in clinical chemistry or histopathologic indications of toxic effects in neonatal pigs.","Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association","11893404",2002,"England"
"Enhancement of L-type Ca(2+) current from neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes by constitutively active PKC-betaII.","The cardiac L-type calcium current (I(Ca)) can be modified by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). However, the effect of PKC activation on I(Ca) is still controversial. Some studies have shown a decrease in current, whereas other studies have reported a biphasic effect (an increase followed by a decrease in current or vice versa). A possible explanation for the conflicting results is that several isoforms of PKC with opposing effects on I(Ca) were activated simultaneously. Here, we examined the influence of a single PKC isoform (PKC-betaII) on L-type calcium channels in isolation from other cardiac isoforms, using a transgenic mouse that conditionally expresses PKC-betaII. Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from newborn mice and examined for expression of the transgene using single cell RT-PCR after I(Ca) recording. Cells expressing PKC-betaII showed a twofold increase in nifedipine-sensitive I(Ca). The PKC-betaII antagonist LY-379196 returned I(Ca) amplitude to levels found in non-PKC-betaII-expressing myocytes. The increase in I(Ca) was independent of Ca(v)1.2-subunit mRNA levels as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Thus these data demonstrate that PKC-beta is a potent modulator of cardiac L-type calcium channels and that this specific isoform increases I(Ca) in neonatal ventricular myocytes.","American journal of physiology.

"Ultra-low-volume, real-time measurements of lactate from the single heart cell using microsystems technology.","The fabrication of microelectrodes integrated within ultra-low-volume microtiter chambers for the amperometric determination of metabolites continues to be of interest in the subject of single-cell and high-throughput screening.

Devices were fabricated using photolithography and liftoff giving reproducible sensors integrated within high aspect ratio titer chambers (with a volume of 360 pL), made of the photoepoxy SU8. In this paper, the determination of lactate was optimized using an enzyme-linked assay based upon lactate oxidase, involving the amperometric determination of hydrogen peroxide at +640 mV versus an internal Ag/AgCl pseudoreference. The microsystem (including the microfluidic dispensers and structures as well as the microsensor) was subsequently used to measure the lactate content of single heart cells. Dynamic electrochemical measurements of lactate during cell permeabilization are presented. We also show the use of respiratory uncouplers to simulate ischemia in the single myocyte and show that, as expected, the rate of lactate production from the hypoxic heart cell is greater than that within the normoxic healthy myocyte.","Analytical chemistry","11866072",2002,"United States"
"Imbalance between xanthine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase signaling pathways underlies mechanoenergetic uncoupling in the failing heart.","Inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XO) in failing hearts improves cardiac efficiency by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that this energetic effect is due to reduced oxidative stress and critically depends on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, reflecting a balance between generation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species. In dogs with pacing-induced heart failure (HF), ascorbate (1000 mg) mimicked the beneficial energetic effects of allopurinol, increasing both contractility and efficiency, suggesting an antioxidant mechanism. Allopurinol had no additive effect beyond that of ascorbate. Crosstalk between XO and NOS signaling was assessed. NOS inhibition with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 20 mg/kg) had no effect on basal contractility or efficiency in HF, but prevented the +26.2+/-3.5% and +66.5+/-17% enhancements of contractility and efficiency, respectively, observed with allopurinol alone. Similarly, improvements in contractility and energetics due to ascorbate were also inhibited by L-NMMA. Because of the observed NOS-XO crosstalk, we predicted that in normal hearts NOS inhibition would uncover a depression of energetics caused by XO activity. In normal conscious dogs, L-NMMA increased myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) while lowering left ventricular external work, reducing efficiency by 31.1+/-3.8% (P&lt;0.005). Lowered efficiency was reversed by XO inhibition (allopurinol, 200 mg) or by ascorbate without affecting cardiac load or systemic hemodynamics. Single-cell immunofluorescence detected XO protein in cardiac myocytes that was enhanced in HF, consistent with autocrine signaling. These data show that both NOS and XO signaling systems participate in the regulation of myocardial mechanical efficiency and that upregulation of XO relative to NOS contributes to mechanoenergetic uncoupling in heart failure.","Circulation research","11861418",2002,"United States"
"Dominant-negative connexin43-EGFP inhibits calcium-transient synchronization of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.","Recent studies using mice with genetically engineered gap junction protein connexin (Cx) genes have provided evidence that reduced gap-junctional coupling in ventricular cardiomyocytes predisposes to ventricular arrhythmia. However, the pathological processes of arrhythmogenesis due to abnormalities in gap junctions are poorly understood. We have postulated a hypothesis that dysfunction of gap junctions at the single-cell level may affect synchronization of calcium transients among cardiomyocytes. To examine this hypothesis, we developed a novel system in which gap-junctional intercellular communication in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was inhibited by a mutated (Delta130-137) Cx43 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (Cx43-EGFP), and calcium transients were imaged in real time while the mutated Cx43-EGFP-expressing cardiomyocytes were identified. The mutated Cx43-EGFP inhibited dye coupling not only in the liver epithelial cell line IAR 20 but also in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in a dominant-negative manner, whereas wild-type Cx43-EGFP made functional gap junctions in otherwise communication-deficient HeLa cells. The mutated Cx43-EGFP induced desynchronization of calcium transients among cardiomyocytes with significantly higher frequency than wild-type Cx43-EGFP. These results suggest that dysfunction of gap-junctional intercellular communication at the single-cell level could hamper synchronous beating among cardiomyocytes as a result of desynchronization of calcium transients.","Experimental cell research","11795949",2002,"United States"
"Effects of repeated brain ischemia induced by rapid lower body negative pressure on brain water and Na+,K+-ATPase activity in rats.","BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that during +Gz exposure cerebral blood flow is significantly reduced resulting in brain ischemia. Animal centrifuge models are commonly used to investigate the mechanisms of +Gz-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) and their pathophysiological effects on the brain. These dynamic models are limited because we currently are unable to obtain accurate measures of membrane ion flux or single cell electrophysiological responses from animals under centrifugation.HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to develop a non-centrifuge animal model of short-term, repeatable and complete brain ischemia using a rodent lower body negative pressure (LBNP), and to investigate the effects of repeated complete brain ischemia induced by LBNP on brain Na+,K+-ATPase activity, Na+, K+ and water contents in rats.METHODS: Eight anesthetized rats were exposed randomly to LBNP of -2.67 kPa, -4.00 kPa, and -5.33 kPa, respectively, at the rate of -0.67 kPa x s(-1). The pressure rapidly returned to control level when EEG became isoelectric (flat). The mean arterial BP (MAP), EEG and ECG were recorded. Twenty-one rats were divided randomly into control, single LBNP exposure, and three LBNP exposures groups (n = 7 in each group). Brain samples were analyzed for Na+,K+-ATPase activity, Na+, K+ and water contents 1 h after single and three 2-min LBNP exposures (-4.00 kPa at a rate of 0.67 kPa x s(-1)), respectively.RESULTS: MAP decreased rapidly during LBNP exposure. The mean time to isoelectric EEG was 41.33 +/- 11.48, 30.67 +/- 3.88 and 25.67 +/- 3.45 s during -2.67, -4.00 and -5.33 kPa LBNP, respectively. Heart rate (HR) significantly decreased when EEG became isoelectric. MAP, HR and EEG rapidly returned after releasing LBNP. The brain Na+,K-ATPase activity decreased significantly after single LBNP exposure and decreased further after three LBNP exposures. The brain K+, Na+ and water contents increased significantly after three LBNP exposures.CONCLUSIONS: A rat model of short-term, repeatable brain ischemia was developed using rapid LBNP. Three -4.00 kPa LBNP exposures (2 min each) cause a significant reduction in brain Na+,K+-ATPase activity and brain edema in rats.","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine","11817620",2002,"United States"
"Force/shortening-frequency relationship in multicellular muscle strips and single cardiomyocytes of human failing and nonfailing hearts.","BACKGROUND: Force of contraction (FOC) frequency-dependently increases in multicellular muscle strip preparations of human nonfailing myocardium, whereas FOC declines in human failing myocardium with increasing stimulation frequency. We investigated whether these characteristics can be observed in single isolated myocytes.METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated multicellular muscle strip preparations and single isolated cardiomyocytes of failing (heart transplants, dilative cardiomyopathy; n = 11) and nonfailing (donor hearts; n = 11) human hearts were studied. The changes in contraction amplitude (cell shortening in micrometers) at increasing frequency of stimulation (0.5-2 Hz) were continuously recorded with a 1-dimensional high-speed camera that detected the cell edges and measured their distance during contraction. The increase in stimulation frequency was associated with a significant decrease in FOC (2 v 0.5 Hz; 68% basal) and a decrease in cell shortening of human left ventricular cardiomyocytes from failing hearts (2 v 0.5 Hz; 65% basal). In contrast, in human nonfailing myocardium, contraction increased at increasing stimulation frequencies (2 v 0.5 Hz; FOC, 180% basal; cell shortening, 129% basal).CONCLUSIONS: The negative force-frequency relationship measured in multicellular preparations of failing human myocardium results from alterations at the single cell level.","Journal of cardiac failure","11782857",2002,"United States"
"Antioxidants prevent the lymphocyte DNA damage induced by PMA-stimulated monocytes.","Oxidative stress has been related to several degenerative diseases such as cancer and coronary heart disease. Reactive oxygen species can damage different cellular macromolecules, including DNA, which is directly responsible for mutation and carcinogenesis. In this study, monocytes that were activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were coincubated with lymphocytes, and the DNA damage was measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Stimulation of monocytes with PMA activates the &quot;respiratory burst,&quot; which evokes DNA damage in lymphocytes. The extent of the damage is related to the concentration of monocytes and the exposure time. Exogenous addition of superoxide dismutase did not prevent the DNA damage, which suggests that superoxide ions are not directly responsible for the damage. Partial protection was observed when catalase was included (60% protection), which indicates that other reactive species, in addition to H2O2, are responsible for the damage. In this system, the protective activity of natural antioxidants at different concentrations was also investigated. After coincubation of PMA-activated monocytes with lymphocytes in the presence of each antioxidant for one hour at 37 degrees C, the lymphocyte DNA damage was determined. All the compounds protected the lymphocytes to a certain degree, with a maximum effect at different concentrations: 41% protection with 1 microM ascorbic acid, 55% protection with 40 microM alpha-tocopherol, 50% protection with 3 microM beta-carotene, and 56% protection with 5 microM quercetin. On the basis of these results, we maintain that this &quot;ex vivo model,&quot; more closely related to physiological conditions, could be used to test the antioxidant activity of different compounds.","Nutrition and cancer","11759293",2002,"United States"

"A defect in the Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2) gene leads to a complete loss of I(to) and confers susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia.","KChIP2, a gene encoding three auxiliary subunits of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, is preferentially expressed in the adult heart, and its expression is downregulated in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice deficient for KChIP2 exhibit normal cardiac structure and function but display a prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The KChIP2(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward potassium current, I(to), and a marked increase in action potential duration. These studies demonstrate that a defect in KChIP2 is sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias, establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a loss of the transmural gradient of I(to).","Cell","11747815",2001,"United States"
"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha production in fibrosing alveolitis is macrophage subset specific.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have revealed that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is upregulated in fibrosing alveolitis (FA) in humans. The aim of this study was to compare the TNF-alpha secretory profile of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and peripheral blood monocytes (Mos) of patients with cryptogenic FA and systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rheumatological disorder in which lung fibrosis can occur. In particular, we wished to assess whether TNF-alpha levels differ between SSc patients with FA (FASSc) and a nonfibrotic group.METHODS: The reverse haemolytic plaque assay was used to evaluate the secretion of cytokine at a single cell level while immunostaining allowed subtyping of AMs and Mos.RESULTS: This study demonstrated a difference in total TNF-alpha levels produced by AMs when the levels in subjects with FA (cryptogenic FA and FASSc) were compared to levels in either SSc patients without FA (P = 0.0002) or normal healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, AMs from patients with FASSc secreted more TNF-alpha than those of patients with no FA (P = 0.003). In contrast, there were no significant differences in Mo TNF-alpha secretion between the groups. A positive correlation was found between total TNF-alpha level and number of neutrophils obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with FA (r = 0.49, P &lt; 0.04). Finally, it was demonstrated that there was significant heterogeneity of TNF-alpha secretion and that a numerically significant subset of mononuclear phagocytes, RFD7, was responsible for more than 80% of TNF-alpha production.CONCLUSION: By demonstrating the primary cell source of TNF-alpha in FASSc, more accurately targeted, possibly localized, anti-TNF strategies might be employed with success in the future.","Respiratory research","11737936",2001,"England"
"Real-time imaging of apoptotic cell-membrane changes at the single-cell level in the beating murine heart.","We report a novel real-time imaging model to visualize apoptotic membrane changes of single cardiomyocytes in the injured heart of the living mouse, using fluorescent labeled annexin-V. Annexin-V binds to externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) of cells undergoing programmed cell death. With high-magnification (x100-160) real-time imaging, we visualized the binding of annexin-V to single cardiomyocytes. Kinetic studies at the single-cell level revealed that cardiomyocytes started to bind annexin-V within minutes after reperfusion, following an ischemic period of 30 minutes. The amount of bound annexin-V increased rapidly and reached a maximum within 20-25 minutes. Caspase inhibitors decreased the number of annexin-V-positive cardiomyocytes and slowed down the rate of PS exposure of cardiomyocytes that still bound annexin-V. This technology to study cell biology in the natural environment will enhance knowledge of intracellular signaling pathways relevant for cell-death regulation and strategies to manipulate these pathways for therapeutic effect.","Nature medicine","11726977",2001,"United States"
"DNA oxidative damage during differentiation of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells.","DNA oxidative damage was measured in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, in the same cells committed to granulocytic differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and in mature human peripheral granulocytes (HPG). DNA damage was evaluated as single strand breaks and 8-OHdG adducts, measured by single cell electrophoresis or by monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The basal levels of either marker of DNA damage were higher in undifferentiated HL-60 cells than in HPG and DMSO- or RA-differentiated cells. Treatment with H(2)O(2) increased 8-OHdG formation in all cells, but the levels of DNA damage remained higher in undifferentiated cells as compared to the differentiated ones. Three lines of evidence suggested that the higher levels of DNA damage observed in undifferentiated cells were at least in part attributable to a reduced detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). First, undifferentiated cells were shown to accumulate higher levels of dichlorodihydrofluorescein-detectable ROS than HPG and DMSO- or RA-differentiated cells. Second, undifferentiated HL-60 cells were characterized by reduced levels of GSH and lower GSH/GSSG ratios as compared to the differentiated cells. Third, pretreatment of undifferentiated HL-60 cells with antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene suppressed the elevation of ROS and the formation of 8-OHdG induced by H(2)O(2). Further evidence for the importance of the oxidant/antioxidant balance was obtained by modulating the iron-catalyzed decomposition of H(2)O(2) to hydroxyl radicals in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. In fact, pretreatment with FeSO(4) increased the formation of 8-OHdG induced by H(2)O(2), whereas pretreatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine produced the opposite effect. These results illustrate correlations between the oxidant/antioxidant balance and DNA damage and suggest that the capability of a cell population to withstand oxidative stress and DNA damage may depend on its degree of differentiation.","Chemical research in toxicology","11712906",2001,"United States"
"The contribution of ionic currents to changes in refractoriness of human atrial myocytes associated with chronic atrial fibrillation.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in human atrial single cell functional electrophysiological properties associated with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), and the contribution to these of accompanying ion current changes.METHODS: The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record action potentials, the effective refractory period (ERP) and ion currents, in the absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (&gt;6 months) AF and 39 patients in sinus rhythm.RESULTS: Stimulation at high rates (up to 600 beats/min) markedly shortened late repolarisation and the ERP in cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). Chronic AF was associated with a reduction in the ERP at physiological rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, P&lt;0.05), and marked attenuation in rate effects on the ERP and repolarisation. The abbreviated terminal phase of repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced depolarisation of the MDP in cells from patients with AF. The density of L-type Ca(2+) (I(CaL)) and transient outward K(+) (I(TO)) currents was significantly reduced in cells from patients with AF (by 60-65%), whilst the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was increased, and the sustained outward current (I(KSUS)) was unaltered. Superfusion of cells from patients in sinus rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l) moderately shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the ERP (228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-Aminopyridine (2 mmol/l) markedly prolonged repolarisation and the ERP (by 35%, P&lt;0.05). However, the combination of these drugs had no effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.CONCLUSION: Chronic AF in humans is associated with attenuation in adaptation of the atrial single cell ERP and MDP to fast rates, which may not be explained fully by accompanying changes in I(CaL) and I(TO).","Cardiovascular research","11684070",2001,"United Kingdom"
"Inhomogeneity of action potential waveshape assists frequency entrainment of cardiac pacemaker cells.","In this paper, we have employed ionic models of sinoatrial node cells to investigate the synchronization of a pair of coupled cardiac pacemaker cells from central and peripheral regions of the sinoatrial node. The free-running cycle length of the cell models was perturbed using two independent techniques and the minimum coupling conductance required to achieve frequency entrainment was used to assess the relative ease with which various cell pairs achieve entrainment. The factors effecting entrainment were further investigated using single-cell models paced with an artificial biphasic coupling current. Our simulation results suggest that dissimilar cell types, those with largely different upstroke velocities entrain more easily, that is, they require less coupling conductance to achieve 1:1 frequency entrainment. We, therefore, propose that regional variation in action-potential waveshape within the sinoatrial node assists frequency synchronization in vivo.","IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering","11585034",2001,"United States"
"Enhanced in vivo and in vitro contractile responses to beta(2)-adrenergic receptor stimulation in dogs susceptible to lethal arrhythmias.","The response to beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation was evaluated in both isolated cardiomyocytes (video edge detection) and the intact animal (echocardiography) in dogs either susceptible (S) or resistant (R) to ventricular fibrillation induced by a 2-min coronary occlusion during the last minute of exercise. In the intact animal, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) was evaluated both before (n = 27, S = 12 and R = 15) and after myocardial infarction. Before infarction, increasing doses of isoproterenol provoked similar contractile and heart rate responses in each group of dogs. Either beta(1)-AR (bisoprolol) or beta(2)-AR (ICI-118551) antagonists reduced the isoproterenol response, with a larger reduction noted after the beta(1)-AR blockade. In contrast, after infarction, isoproterenol induced a significantly larger Vcf and heart rate response in the susceptible animals that was eliminated by beta(2)-AR blockade. The single-cell isotonic shortening response to isoproterenol (100 nM) was also larger in cells obtained from susceptible compared with resistant dogs and was reduced to a greater extent by beta(2)-AR blockade in the susceptible dog myocytes (S, -48%, n = 6; R, -15%, n = 9). When considered together, these data suggest that myocardial infarction provoked an enhanced beta(2)-AR response in susceptible, but not resistant, animals.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","11568144",2001,"United States"
"Early cancer cell dissemination and late metastatic relapse: clinical reflections and biological approaches to the dormancy problem in patients.","Two clinical entities, unknown-primary cancer and inadvertent transmission of cancer with organ transplants are reviewed and discussed in the context of early and occult tumor cell dissemination. Both entities are taken as chief witnesses for cell dissemination being an early event in tumor progression. The involuntary transmission of tumor by organ grafts directly supports the notion that very few quiescent cells lodging at improbable sites such as kidney or heart suffice to generate de novo metastatic disease in the organ recipient. As to the nature of the cells and their biological and clinical significance a short review is given on the detection of disseminated cells in bone marrow and their prognostic significance for a metastatic relapse in patients with resected primary tumors. A novel single-cell genomic analysis is described, that allows the detection of multiple chromosomal aberration in single tumor cells.","Seminars in cancer biology","11513566",2001,"England"
"Heart failure after myocardial infarction: altered excitation-contraction coupling.","BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) frequently follows the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI). Questions about how HF develops and what cellular defects contribute to this dysfunction led to this study. Methods and Results-- MI was induced in rats by coronary artery ligation. Clinical examination of the post-MI (PMI) surviving animals indicated that they were in overt HF by all measures. Cellular examination of the cardiomyocytes by patch-clamp and confocal [Ca(2+)](i) imaging methods indicated that cellular function was significantly compromised. At the single-cell level, [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitudes were reduced and contractions were decreased and slowed, although Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) remained unchanged. The excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) gain function measured as Delta[Ca(2+)](i)/I(Ca) was significantly decreased. Ouabain, a cardiotonic steroid that blocks the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and activates Ca(2+) entry via cardiac Na(+) channels, largely alleviated this defect.CONCLUSIONS: After MI, I(Ca) becomes less able to trigger release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This failure of ECC is a major factor contributing to the development of contractile dysfunction and HF in PMI animals. The improved ECC gain, enhanced Ca(2+) entry, and augmented Ca(2+) signaling due to cardiotonic steroids contribute to the beneficial effects of these agents.","Circulation","11489776",2001,"United States"
"Cardiac cellular actions of hydrochlorothiazide.","In long term treatment, thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) lower blood pressure by decreasing peripheral resistance rather than by their diuretic effect. This action has been attributed to the opening of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, little is known about their cardiac cellular actions. Here we investigated the possible actions of HCTZ on action potential and contraction of rat ventricular muscle strips and on the ionic currents of isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. HCTZ depressed ventricular contraction with an IC30 of 1.85 microM (60% decrease at 100 microM). Action potential duration at -60 mV and maximal rate of depolarization were, however, only slightly decreased by 12% and 22%, respectively, at 100 microM. At the single cell level, HCTZ (100 microM) depressed the fast Na+ current (INa) and the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) by 30% and 20%, respectively. The effects on ICaL were not voltage-or frequency-dependent. In cells intracellularly perfused with 50 microM cyclic adenosine, monophosphate HCTZ reduced ICaL by 33%. The transient (Ito), the delayed rectifier and the inward rectifier potassium currents were decreased by 20% at 100 microM HCTZ. The effects on Ito were voltage-dependent. In conclusion, HCTZ at high concentrations possesses a negative inotropic action that could be in part due to its blocking action on INa and ICaL. The actions of HCTZ on multiple cardiac ionic currents could explain its weak effect on action potential duration.","Fundamental &amp; clinical pharmacology","11468008",2001,"England"
"Isolated ventricular myocytes from copper-deficient rat hearts exhibit enhanced contractile function.","Dietary copper deficiency leads to cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, derangement of myofibrils, and impaired cardiac contractile and electrophysiological function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether impaired cardiac function from copper deficiency is due to depressed contractile function at the single myocyte level. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets that were either copper adequate (5.59-6.05 microg copper/g body wt; n = 11) or copper deficient (0.29-0.34 microg copper/g body wt; n = 11) for 5 wk. Ventricular myocytes were dispersed and mechanical properties were evaluated using the SoftEdge video-based edge-detection system. Intracellular Ca2+ transients were examined using fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester. Myocytes were electrically stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Properties evaluated included peak shortening (PS), time to peak shortening (TPS), time to 90% relengthening (TR90), and maximal velocities of shortening and relengthening (+/-dL/dt). Myocytes from the copper-deficient rat hearts exhibited significantly enhanced PS values associated with shortened TR90 measurements compared with those from copper-adequate rat hearts. The +/-dL/dt values were enhanced and the intracellular Ca2+ transient decay rate was depressed in myocytes from copper-deficient rats. These data indicate that impaired cardiac contractile function that is seen in copper-deficient whole hearts might not be due to depressed cardiac contractile function at the single cell level but rather to other mechanisms such as cardiac fibrosis.","American journal of physiology.

"Patterns of wave break during ventricular fibrillation in isolated swine right ventricle.","Several different patterns of wave break have been described by mapping of the tissue surface during fibrillation. However, it is not clear whether these surface patterns are caused by multiple distinct mechanisms or by a single mechanism. To determine the mechanism by which wave breaks are generated during ventricular fibrillation, we conducted optical mapping studies and single cell transmembrane potential recording in six isolated swine right ventricles (RV). Among 763 episodes of wave break (0.75 times x s(-1) x cm(-2)), optical maps showed three patterns: 80% due to a wave front encountering the refractory wave back of another wave, 11.5% due to wave fronts passing perpendicular to each other, and 8.5% due to a new (target) wave arising just beyond the refractory tail of a previous wave. Computer simulations of scroll waves in three-dimensional tissue showed that these surface patterns could be attributed to two fundamental mechanisms: head-tail interactions and filament break. We conclude that during sustained ventricular fibrillation in swine RV, surface patterns of wave break are produced by two fundamental mechanisms: head-tail interaction between waves and filament break.","American journal of physiology.

"Origin of neointimal endothelium and alpha-actin-positive smooth muscle cells in transplant arteriosclerosis.","The development of transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) is today's most important problem in clinical organ transplantation. Histologically, TA is characterized by perivascular inflammation and progressive intimal thickening. Current thought on this process of vascular remodeling assumes that neointimal vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and endothelium in TA are graft-derived, holding that medial VSM cells proliferate and migrate into the subendothelial space in response to signals from inflammatory cells and damaged graft endothelium. Using MHC class I haplotype-specific immunohistochemical staining and single-cell PCR analyses, we show that the neointimal alpha-actin-positive VSM cells in rat aortic or cardiac allografts are of recipient and not of donor origin. In aortic but not in cardiac allografts, recipient-derived endothelial cells (ECs) replaced donor endothelium. Cyclosporine treatment prevents neointima formation and preserves the vascular media in aortic allografts. Recipient-derived ECs do not replace graft endothelium after cyclosporine treatment. We propose that, although it progresses beyond the needs of functional repair, TA reflects the activity of a normal healing process that restores vascular wall function following allograft-induced immunological injury.","The Journal of clinical investigation","11390423",2001,"United States"
"Effects of diacetyl monoxime and cytochalasin D on ventricular fibrillation in swine right ventricles.","Whether or not the excitation-contraction (E-C) uncoupler diacetyl monoxime (DAM) and cytochalacin D (Cyto D) alter the ventricular fibrillation (VF) activation patterns is unclear. We recorded single cell action potentials and performed optical mapping in isolated perfused swine right ventricles (RV) at different concentrations of DAM and Cyto D. Increasing the concentration of DAM results in progressively shortened action potential duration (APD) measured to 90% repolarization, reduced the slope of the APD restitition curve, decreased Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and reduced the number of VF wave fronts. In all RVs, 15-20 mmol/l DAM converted VF to ventricular tachycardia (VT). The VF could be reinduced after the DAM was washed out. In comparison, Cyto D (10-40 micromol/l) has no effects on APD restitution curve or the dynamics of VF. The effects of DAM on VF are associated with a reduced number of wave fronts and dynamic complexities in VF. These results are compatible with the restitution hypothesis of VF and suggest that DAM may be unsuitable as an E-C uncoupler for optical mapping studies of VF in the swine RVs.","American journal of physiology.

"Pinacidil prevents membrane depolarisation and intracellular Ca2+ loading in single cardiomyocytes exposed to severe metabolic stress.","Recently, it has been proposed that, besides sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels, the activation of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels may also contribute to the cardioprotective action of potassium channel openers. In this respect, use of drugs that target both mitochondrial and sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels, such as pinacidil, may be a promising therapeutic strategy against metabolic injury of the heart. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to determine whether pinacidil could maintain the value of resting membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiac cells exposed to metabolic stress. Experiments were performed on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes. The membrane potential was monitored during experiments using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by a digital epifluorescence imaging. Chemical hypoxia-reoxygenation was induced by application and removal of the mitochondrial poison 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP). Under hypoxia-reoxygenation, membrane depolarisation and intracellular Ca2+ loading was induced by Ca2+ influx during hypoxia and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores during reoxygenation. The K(ATP) channel activator, pinacidil, prevented intracellular Ca2+ loading and membrane depolarisation, irrespective of whether the channel opener was applied throughout the duration of hypoxia-reoxygenation or transiently during the hypoxic or reoxygenation stage. Thus, the present study provides evidence that pinacidil, a non-selective K(ATP) channel opener, can handle membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia-reoxygenation irrespective of the stage of the metabolic insult. This provides further evidence, at the single cell level, that targeting K(ATP) channels may be a valuable approach to protect the myocardium against metabolic challenge.","International journal of molecular medicine","11351278",2001,"Greece"
"Deconvolution and wavelet-based methods for membrane current estimation from simulated fractionated electrograms.","In infarcted myocardium, extracellular recordings exhibit multiple deflections due to irregular pathway of the electric impulse. In this work the problem of distinguishing local from distant deflections is tackled. In order to evaluate the proposed methods in a controlled setting, simulated data are used, following both Beeler-Reuter and Luo-Rudy kinetics. The input is an array of electrograms positioned on grid-points of a rectangular grid and the output is an array of estimates of the membrane current. First, deconvolution techniques are used in the form of spatial filtering for membrane current estimation from the extracellular recordings. Second, the extracellular recordings undergo wavelet based transformation, followed by a spatial filter which enhances local activity deflections and suppresses distant activity deflections. It is shown that wavelet filtering of the extracellular recordings acts as an evaluator of the efficiency of the deconvolution techniques for the membrane current estimation. Subsequently, activation times based on the results from the two methods are used for the reconstruction of the propagation pattern in a zig-zag case in two-dimensional grids. It is shown that the wavelet-based method is more robust, and can work well even in cases where the grid interval in the y direction is four times larger than the single cell size.","IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering","11327497",2001,"United States"
"Heterogeneity of Kv2.1 mRNA expression and delayed rectifier current in single isolated myocytes from rat left ventricle.","Expression of the voltage-gated K(+) channel Kv2.1, a possible molecular correlate for the cardiac delayed rectifier current (I(K)), has recently been shown to vary between individual ventricular myocytes. The functional consequences of this cell-to-cell heterogeneity in Kv2.1 expression are not known. Using multiplex single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we detected Kv2.1 mRNA in 47% of isolated midmyocardial myocytes from the rat left ventricular free wall that were positive for alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA (n=74). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated marked differences in the magnitude of I(K) (200 to 1450 pA at V(Pip)=40 mV) between individual myocytes of the same origin. Furthermore, the tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive outward current (I(TEA)), known to be partly encoded by Kv2.1 in mice, revealed a wide range of current magnitudes between single cells (150 to 1130 pA at V(Pip)=40 mV). Combined patch-clamp recordings and multiplex single-cell RT-PCR analysis of the same myocytes, however, showed no differences in I(K) or I(TEA) magnitude or inactivation kinetics between myocytes expressing Kv2.1 mRNA and those that did not express Kv2.1 mRNA. In contrast, in all midmyocardial myocytes expressing the transient outward potassium current (I(to1)), Kv4 mRNA, which has been shown to underlie I(to1), was detected (n=10). These results indicate that I(K) heterogeneity among individual left ventricular myocytes cannot be explained by the distribution pattern of Kv2.1 mRNA. Other mechanisms besides Kv2.1 mRNA expression appear to determine magnitude and kinetics of I(K) in rat ventricular myocytes.","Circulation research","11249871",2001,"United States"
"Localized injury in cardiomyocyte network: a new experimental model of ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmias.","We developed a new experimental approach to study the effects of local injury in a multicellular preparation and tested the ability of the method to induce reperfusion arrhythmias in cardiomyocyte monolayers. A small region of injury was created using geometrically defined flows of control and ischemia-like solutions. Calcium transients were acquired simultaneously from injured, control, and border zone cells using fluo 4. Superfusion with the injury solution rapidly diminished the amplitude of calcium transients within the injury zone, followed by cessation of cell beating. Reperfusion caused an immediate tachyarrhythmic response in approximately 17% of experiments, with a wave front propagating from a single cell or small cell cluster within the former injury zone. Inclusion of a gap junction uncoupler (1 mM heptanol) in the injury solution narrowed the functional border and sharply increased the number of ectopic foci and the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias. The model holds a potential to reveal both micro- and macroscopic features of propagation, conduction, and cell coupling in the normal and diseased myocardium and to serve as a new tool to test antiarrhythmic protocols in vitro.","American journal of physiology.

"Oxygen free radicals and excitation-contraction coupling.","Oxygen free radicals (OFR) contribute to contractile failure, rigor, and calcium (Ca2+) overload in ischemic/reperfused myocardium. Using both multicellular and isolated single-cell preparations, our laboratory has identified two fundamental mechanisms contributing to the deleterious effects of OFR: (i) impaired myocardial metabolism, and (ii) altered myocardial calcium handling. Impaired metabolism leads to activation of metabolically sensitive K+ currents, which shorten the action potential, thereby decreasing the duration of systole. Ultimately, high-energy phosphate depletion secondary to metabolic failure results in rigor. Altered myocardial Ca2+ handling is evidenced by a decrease in Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels [another cause of decreased action potential duration (APD)], a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content, slowed Ca2+ uptake in diastole, and increased sodium-calcium exchange (NaCaX) activity. The increase in NaCaX activity may contribute to the early increase in developed tension frequently observed in multicellular preparations exposed to free radicals, as well as the SR depletion occurring early on in voltage-clamped isolated cell preparations. Increased NaCaX activity is likely to be a critical factor underlying the late Ca2+ overload that occurs in the setting of increased intracellular Na+, and which leads to irreversible injury. The extent to which free radical-mediated metabolic inhibition participates in the dysfunction of the L-type Ca2+ channel is uncertain. The altered activity of the SR Ca2+ pump and NaCaX are more likely caused by direct actions of OFR on these proteins.","Antioxidants &amp; redox signaling","11232601",2001,"United States"
"No protection of the porcine kidney by ischaemic preconditioning.","One or more episodes of sublethal ischaemia and reperfusion delay infarct development during subsequent, sustained ischaemia in the heart and skeletal muscle. The present study tested whether or not such ischaemic preconditioning (IP) also protects the kidney. Enflurane-anaesthetized pigs underwent 60 min of right renal vessel occlusion (RVO), followed by 8 h of reperfusion without (placebo group, n = 8) or with three preceding cycles of 10 min RVO and 10 min reperfusion (IP group, n = 8). After 8 h of reperfusion, kidneys were oliguric in both groups (placebo group: 23 +/- 21 ml x h(-1), IP group: 24 +/- 27 ml x h(-1)). A transient polyuric phase occurred in the IP group at 2 h reperfusion. The reperfused kidneys did not excrete inulin, creatinine or urea in both groups, although renal blood flow during reperfusion was similar to baseline. Morphological damage ranged in both groups from single cell necrosis to disseminated patchy necrosis; the number of pyknotic cells tended to be higher in the IP group than in the placebo group (27.0 +/- 7.1 vs. 15.6 +/- 5.6%, n.s.). In anaesthetized pigs, IP did not therefore attenuate renal dysfunction and morphological damage resulting from 60 min of renal normothermic ischaemia followed by 8 h of reperfusion.","Experimental physiology","11187976",2001,"England"
"Effect of phytoestrogen and antioxidant supplementation on oxidative DNA damage assessed using the comet assay.","Antioxidant species may act in vivo to decrease oxidative damage to DNA, protein and lipids thus reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and cancer. Phytoestrogens are plant compounds which are a major component of traditional Asian diets and which may be protective against certain hormone-dependent cancers (breast and prostate) and against coronary heart disease. They may also be able to function as antioxidants, scavenging potentially harmful free radicals. In this study, the effects of the isoflavonoids (a class of phytoestrogen) genistein and equol on hydrogen peroxide-mediated DNA damage in human lymphocytes were determined using alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay). Treatment with hydrogen peroxide significantly increased the levels of DNA strand breaks. Pre-treatment of the cells with both genistein and equol offered protection against this damage at concentrations within the physiological range. This protection was greater than that offered by addition of the known antioxidant vitamins ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol, or the compounds 17beta-oestradiol and Tamoxifen which have similar structures to isoflavonoids and are known to have weak antioxidant properties. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phytoestrogens can, under certain conditions, function as antioxidants and protect against oxidatively-induced DNA damage.","Mutation research","11182547",2001,"Netherlands"
"Quantification and sequencing of somatic deleted mtDNA in single cells: evidence for partially duplicated mtDNA in aged human tissues.","Single-cell PCR of the whole mitochondrial genome provides detailed information about intracellular clonal expansions of deleted mitochondrial DNA (DeltamtDNA), which contribute to aging of the muscle and possibly other tissues. Analysis of approximately 1400 cells from heart, diaphragm and skeletal muscle from 20 individuals without mitochondrial disease revealed that up to 25% of cells in a tissue sample may bear clonally expanded DeltamtDNA. Sequence analysis of &gt;50 clonal DeltamtDNA reveals that about half of them lack the light strand origin of replication. This observation is puzzling since these molecules must have retained the ability to replicate in order to be able to undergo clonal expansion. We present evidence that such DeltamtDNA molecules may in fact exist in the cell as partially duplicated mtDNA (pdmtDNA) previously described in certain mtDNA disorders. In contrast to the 'originless' DeltamtDNA, the corresponding pdmtDNA do possess a light strand origin required for their propagation. Most pdmtDNA also possess an extra heavy strand origin, which may result in higher replication rate and thus provide a mechanism for expansion. Importantly, pdmtDNA are indistinguishable from DeltamtDNA in PCR assays routinely used to detect somatic mtDNA deletions in tissues of normally aged individuals. These results indicate that a substantial proportion of age-related mtDNA deletions reported in the literature may exist as or be derived from pdmtDNA.","Human molecular genetics","11136709",2001,"United States"
"Recipient origin of neointimal vascular smooth muscle cells in cardiac allografts with transplant arteriosclerosis.","BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is today's most important post-heart transplantation problem after the first perioperative year. Histologically, coronary artery disease is characterized by transplant arteriosclerosis. The current view on this vasculopathy is that vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells from the media of affected arteries proliferate and migrate into the sub-endothelial space (intima) in response to signals from inflammatory cells and damaged graft endothelium. According to this model, the intimal VSM cells in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions should originate from donor tissue. Using recipient-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of microdissected, single, neointimal VSM nuclei, we recently showed that after allogeneic aorta transplantation the neointimal VSM cells are of recipient and not of donor origin. In this study, we analyzed whether VSM-cell replacement with recipient-derived cells also takes place after allogeneic heart transplantation.METHODS: Cardiac allografts, when transplanted from female donors to male immune-modulated recipient rats, eventually developed transplant arteriosclerosis. We microdissected alpha-actin positive neointimal VSM cells from tissue sections and determined the origin (donor or recipient) using recipient-specific (male), single-cell, PCR analysis.RESULTS: In total, we analyzed 35 VSM-cell nuclei from 3 allografts, and PCR analysis revealed that 30/35 (86%) of the samples displayed the male-specific 128 base pair DNA fragment. These results indicate that after allogeneic cardiac transplantation, at least 86% of VSM cells in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions are of recipient origin.CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to current thought, the neointimal VSM cells in cardiac allografts that show transplant arteriosclerosis are of recipient and not of donor origin.","The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation","11124488",2000,"United States"
"Glucose- and arginine-induced insulin secretion by human pancreatic beta-cells: the role of HERG K(+) channels in firing and release.","The human ether-a-go-go-related genes (herg) are expressed in tissues other than heart and brain where the HERG K(+) channels are known to regulate the repolarization of the heart action potential and the neuronal spike-frequency accommodation. We provide evidence that herg1 transcripts are present in human pancreatic islets that were used to study both insulin secretion and electrical activity with radioimmunoassay and single cell perforated patch-clamp techniques, respectively. Glucose- and arginine-induced islets insulin secretion data suggested a net increase of release under perfusion with antiarrhythmic drugs known to selectively block HERG channels. Indeed we could routinely isolate a K(+) current that was recognized as biophysically and pharmacologically similar to the HERG current. An analysis of the glucose- and arginine-induced electrical activity (several applications during 30 min) in terms of firing frequency and putative insulin release was done in control and in the presence of selective blockers of HERG channels: the firing frequency and the release increased by 32% and 77%, respectively. It is concluded that HERG channels have a crucial role in regulating insulin secretion and firing of human beta-cells. This raises the possibility that some genetically characterized hyperinsulinemic diseases of unknown origin might involve mutations in the HERG channels.","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","11099479",2000,"Italy"
"Influence of chronic alcohol ingestion on acetaldehyde-induced depression of rat cardiac contractile function.","Long-standing ethanol consumption acts as a chronic cardiac stress and often leads to alcoholic cardiomyopathy. We have recently shown that the acute ethanol-induced depression in myocardial contraction was substantiated by chronic ethanol ingestion. Acetaldehyde (ACA), the main ethanol metabolite, has been considered to play a role in ethanol-induced cardiac dysfunction. To evaluate the ACA-induced cardiac contractile response following chronic ethanol ingestion, mechanical properties were examined using left ventricular papillary muscles and myocytes from rats fed with control or ethanol-enriched diet. Muscles and myocytes were electrically stimulated at 0.5 Hz and contractile properties analysed included peak tension development (PTD) and peak shortening (PS). Intracellular Ca(2+) transients were measured as fura-2 fluorescence intensity changes (DeltaFFI). Papillary muscles from ethanol-consuming animals exhibited reduced baseline PTD and attenuated responsiveness to increase of extracellular Ca(2+). Acute ACA (0.3-10 mM) addition elicited a dose-dependent depression of PTD. However, the inhibition magnitude was significantly reduced in ethanol-treated rats. Myocytes from both control and ethanol-treated rats exhibited comparable ACA-induced depression in both PS and DeltaFFI. Collectively, these data suggest that the ACA-induced depression of myocardial contraction is reduced at the multicellular level, but unchanged at the single cell level, following chronic ethanol ingestion.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)","11093961",2000,"United States"
"Receptors, second messengers and protein kinases required for heterosynaptic cerebellar long-term depression.","Raising the frequency and intensity of stimulation to one of two sets of parallel fibre synaptic inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells results in a localised calcium influx and a long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fibre-Purkinje cell responses. Although the calcium influx remains spatially constrained, depression spreads heterosynaptically to distant sites. Inhibition of the synthetic enzyme for cGMP, guanylate cyclase, did not significantly affect the overall level of calcium-dependent synaptic depression observed at the site of raised stimulation (test site), but it entirely prevented synaptic depression at the distant (control) site. Inhibition of protein kinase G produced identical results. In contrast, protein kinase A inhibition had no effect. Selective inhibition of either metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), protein kinase C (PKC) or tyrosine protein kinase (PTK) blocked depression at both sites equally effectively. These data reveal that two, inter-dependent cellular pathways capable of inducing cerebellar LTD exist. The levels of PF stimulation required to induce heterosynaptic depression were similar to those used routinely in more widely accepted models of LTD. The data predict that cerebellar long-term depression will not be input specific at the single cell level under those conditions of PF-activation that give rise to NO/cGMP production.","Neuropharmacology","11077081",2000,"England"
"Apoptosis: mechanisms and clinical implications.","The balance between cell survival and death is under tight genetic control. A multiplicity of extracellular signals and intracellular mediators is involved in maintaining this balance. When the cell is exposed to physical, biochemical or biological injury, or deprived of necessary substances, it activates a series of stress-response genes. With minimal insults, the cell may recover. With greater insults, single cell death, or apoptosis, results; the cell dies and is recycled to its neighbours. If the insult overwhelms a large number of cells then necrosis ensues, with an accompanying inflammatory response. Dysregulation of the controlling mechanisms of this system results in disease. Deficient apoptosis is associated with cancer, auto-immunity and viral infections. Excessive apoptosis is associated with ischaemic heart disease, stroke, neurodegenerative disease, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. There are myriad therapeutic options unfolding as understanding is gained of apoptosis and its control.","Anaesthesia","11069335",2000,"England"

Furthermore, we show the ability to purify endothelial cells from whole embryos and adult organs by a single step fluorescence activated cell sorting. We expect that these transgenic reporters will be useful tools for imaging vascular morphogenesis, global gene expression profile analysis of endothelial cells, and high throughput screening for vascular mutations.","Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)","11064424",2000,"United States"
"Localisation and functional significance of ryanodine receptors during beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the guinea-pig sino-atrial node.","OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence shows that calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart rate. The aim of this study was to investigate the subcellular distribution of ryanodine receptors in the guinea-pig sino-atrial (SA) node and to determine their functional role in the regulation of pacemaker frequency in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies raised against the cardiac ryanodine receptor were used with confocal microscopy to investigate ryanodine receptor distribution in single guinea-pig SA node cells. The functional role of ryanodine receptors was investigated in both multicellular SA node/atrial preparations and in single SA node cells.RESULTS: Ryanodine receptor labelling was observed in all SA node cells studied and showed both subsarcolemmal and intracellular staining. In the latter, labelling appeared as transverse bands with a regular periodicity of approximately 2 microm. This interval resembled that of the expected sarcomere spacing but did not, however, depend on the presence of transverse tubules. The bands of ryanodine receptors appeared to be located in the region of the Z lines, based on co-distribution studies with antibodies to alpha-actinin, myomesin and binding sites for phalloidin. Functional studies on single SA node cells showed that application of ryanodine (2 micromol/l) reduced the rate of firing of spontaneous action potentials (measured using the perforated patch clamp technique) and this was associated with changes in action potential characteristics. Ryanodine also significantly decreased the positive chronotropic actions of isoprenaline in both multicellular and single cell preparations. In single cells exposed to 100 nmol/l isoprenaline, ryanodine caused a decrease in the rate of firing and this was associated with a decrease in the amplitude of the measured calcium transients.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first to show immunocytochemical evidence for the presence and organisation of ryanodine receptor calcium release channels in mammalian SA node cells. This study also provides evidence of a role for ryanodine sensitive sites in the beta-adrenergic modulation of heart rate in this species.","Cardiovascular research","11054472",2000,"England"

"Isolation of endothelial cells from murine tissue.","The isolation and long-term culture of murine endothelial cells (ECs) has often proven a difficult task. In this paper we describe a quick, efficient protocol for the isolation of microvascular endothelial cells from murine tissues. Murine lung or heart are mechanically minced and enzymatically digested with collagenase and trypsin. The single cell suspension obtained is then incubated with an anti-CD31 antibody, anti-CD105 antibody and with biotinylated isolectin B-4. Pure EC populations are finally obtained by magnetic bead separation using rat anti-mouse Ig- and streptavidin-conjugated microbeads. EC cultures are subsequently expanded and characterised. The surface molecule expression by the primary cultures of murine EC obtained from lung and heart tissue is analysed and compared to that of a murine endothelioma and of primary cultures of murine renal tubular epithelial cells. The phenotype and morphology of these cultures remain stable over 10-15 passages in culture, and no overgrowth of contaminating cells of non-endothelial origin is observed at any stage.","Journal of immunological methods","11033033",2000,"Netherlands"
"Ischemic cardiomyopathy and the cellular renin-angiotensin system.","BACKGROUND: Ischemic cardiomyopathy produced by non-occlusive coronary artery constriction is characterized by left ventricular failure and right ventricular dysfunction, but whether the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is implicated in myocyte dysfunction and cell death remains unclear.METHODS: Changes in single-cell mechanics, the localization of the various constituents of RAS in the myocardium, and the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation on myocyte performance and cell death were measured.RESULTS: Chronic ischemia is coupled with alterations in the mechanical properties and calcium (Ca2+) transients of the remaining viable myocytes. The abnormalities in myocyte mechanics consist of depression in peak shortening and velocity of shortening. Moreover, peak systolic Ca2+ is significantly decreased in the cells. In vitro stimulation with Ang II ameliorates myocyte function and systolic Ca2+. Additionally, adult myocytes express genes for renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and Ang II receptors. Renin, ACE, and Ang II receptors mRNAs increase under the setting of impaired coronary perfusion. Similarly, the percentage of myocytes containing renin, Ang I, and Ang II increases as well. In vitro studies of neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes indicate that Ang II triggers programmed myocyte cell death and this phenomenon is mediated by activation of the AT1 receptor sub-type. Importantly, the AT1-receptor blocker, losartan, completely inhibits apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: These multiple observations are consistent with the notion that Ang II may exert 3 separate functions on the heart: (1) stimulation of myocyte hypertrophy, (2) amelioration of myocyte contractile performance, and (3) activation of the suicide program of myocytes.","The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation","11016481",2000,"United States"
"A novel genetic pathway for sudden cardiac death via defects in the transition between ventricular and conduction system cell lineages.","HF-1 b, an SP1 -related transcription factor, is preferentially expressed in the cardiac conduction system and ventricular myocytes in the heart. Mice deficient for HF-1 b survive to term and exhibit normal cardiac structure and function but display sudden cardiac death and a complete penetrance of conduction system defects, including spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and a high incidence of AV block. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings clearly documented cardiac arrhythmogenesis as the cause of death. Single-cell analysis revealed an anatomic substrate for arrhythmogenesis, including a decrease and mislocalization of connexins and a marked increase in action potential heterogeneity. Two independent markers reveal defects in the formation of ventricular Purkinje fibers. These studies identify a novel genetic pathway for sudden cardiac death via defects in the transition between ventricular and conduction system cell lineages.","Cell","11007485",2000,"United States"
"Coronary microvascular endothelial cells cosecrete angiotensin II and endothelin-1 via a regulated pathway.","Although endothelial cells produce angiotensin II (ANG II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), it is not clear whether a single cell produces both peptides, with cosecretion in response to stimulation, or whether different subpopulations of endothelial cells secrete one or the other peptide, with secretion in response to different stimuli. Exposure of cultured coronary microvascular endothelial cells to cycloheximide for 60 min had no effect on ANG II or ET-1 secretion. This result suggested the existence of a preformed intracellular pool of ANG II and ET-1, which is a precondition for regulated secretion. Exposure of endothelial cells to isoproterenol, high extracellular potassium, or cadmium, all of which stimulate peptide secretion via different signaling pathways, significantly (P &gt; 0.001) increased the secretion of both ANG II and ET-1 in a cell size-dependent manner. Sodium nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine significantly (P &gt; 0.001) decreased ANG II and ET-1 secretion, whereas N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester enhanced it. The similar regulation of ANG II and ET-1 secretion and the presence of both peptides around individual endothelial cells indicate that the autocrine/paracrine regulation of cardiovascular function by endothelial cells is accomplished via cosecretion of ANG II and ET-1.","American journal of physiology.

"Influence of wavefront dynamics on transmembrane potential characteristics during atrial fibrillation.","INTRODUCTION: Although computerized mapping studies have demonstrated the presence of multiple wavelets during atrial fibrillation (AF) and that action potential amplitude and duration in AF vary significantly from beat to beat, no study has correlated the single cell action potential changes with the patterns of activation during AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied wavefront dynamics and single cell transmembrane potential (TMP) characteristics in 12 isolated perfused canine right atria. The endocardial surface was mapped using 477 bipolar electrodes while TMP was recorded with a standard glass microelectrode from an epicardial cell. AF was induced in the presence of acetylcholine. Successful simultaneous TMP recordings and activation maps were made during six episodes of AF and for a total of 141 activations. Large variations of TMP amplitude and duration were observed frequently; 34% of them have a low amplitude (&lt;50% of the amplitude recorded during pacing). Low-amplitude potentials were recorded when the impaled cell was (1) in an area of random reentry (67%, n = 36); (2) within 3.2 mm of the core of organized functional reentry (22%, n = 12); (3) in the middle of two merging wavefronts (9%, n = 5); and (4) at the point of spontaneous wavebreak (2%, n = 1).CONCLUSION: Large variations of TMP are observed frequently during in vitro AF. Low-amplitude TMPs are associated with specific patterns of AF activation wavefronts.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","10969755",2000,"United States"
"Silicon micromachining to tissue engineer branched vascular channels for liver fabrication.","To date, many approaches to engineering new tissue have emerged and they have all relied on vascularization from the host to provide permanent engraftment and mass transfer of oxygen and nutrients. Although this approach has been useful in many tissues, it has not been as successful in thick, complex tissues, particularly those comprising the large vital organs such as the liver, kidney, and heart. In this study, we report preliminary results using micromachining technologies on silicon and Pyrex surfaces to generate complete vascular systems that may be integrated with engineered tissue before implantation. Using standard photolithography techniques, trench patterns reminiscent of branched architecture of vascular and capillary networks were etched onto silicon and Pyrex surfaces to serve as templates. Hepatocytes and endothelial cells were cultured and subsequently lifted as single-cell monolayers from these two-dimensional molds. Both cell types were viable and proliferative on these surfaces. In addition, hepatocytes maintained albumin production. The lifted monolayers were then folded into compact three-dimensional tissues. Thus, with the use microfabrication technology in tissue engineering, it now seems feasible to consider lifting endothelial cells as branched vascular networks from two-dimensional templates that may ultimately be combined with layers of parenchymal tissue, such as hepatocytes, to form three-dimensional conformations of living vascularized tissue for implantation.","Tissue engineering","10941206",2000,"United States"
"Intracellular calcium and the relationship to contractility in an avian model of heart failure.","Global contractile heart failure was induced in turkey poults by furazolidone feeding (700 ppm). Abnormal calcium regulation appears to be a key factor in the pathophysiology of heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms contributing to changes in calcium fluxes have not been clearly defined. Isolated ventricular myocytes from non-failing and failing hearts were therefore used to determine whether the whole heart and ventricular muscle contractile dysfunctions were realized at the single cell level. Whole cell current- and voltage-clamp techniques were used to evaluate action potential configurations and L-type calcium currents, respectively. Intracellular calcium transients were evaluated in isolated myocytes with fura-2 and in isolated left ventricular muscles using aequorin. Action potential durations were prolonged in failing myocytes, which correspond to slowed cytosolic calcium clearing. Calcium current-voltage relationships were normal in failing myocytes; preliminary evidence suggests that depressed transient outward potassium currents contribute to prolonged action potential durations. The number of calcium channels (as measured by radioligand binding) were also similar in non-failing and failing hearts. Isolated ventricular muscles from failing hearts had enhanced inotropic responses, in a dose-dependent fashion, to a calcium channel agonist (Bay K 8644). These data suggest that changes in intracellular calcium mobilization kinetics and longer calcium-myofilament interaction may be able to compensate for contractile failure. We conclude that the relationship between calcium current density and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release is a dynamic process that may be altered in the setting of heart failure at higher contraction rates.","Journal of comparative physiology.

"Expression of angiotensin AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in adult rat cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction. A single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction study.","The effector hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II, plays a major role in cardiovascular regulation. In rats, both angiotensin receptor subtypes, AT(1) and AT(2), are up-regulated after myocardial infarction but previous studies failed to identify the cell types which express the AT(2) receptor in the heart. To address this question we established a single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for AT(1) and AT(2) receptors to determine whether these receptor subtypes are expressed in adult rat cardiomyocytes before and 1 day after myocardial infarction. By laser-assisted cell picking, section profiles of single cells without genomic DNA contamination were isolated. After dividing samples into two identical aliquots, polymerase chain reaction amplification for AT(1) and AT(2) receptors was carried out and polymerase chain reaction products were subjected to gel electrophoresis. Compared to control (n = 4) and sham-operated animals (n = 4), the number of cardiomyocytes expressing the AT(1) receptor mRNA 1 day after myocardial infarction (n = 4) was not changed (42% and 33% versus 45%, respectively). On the other hand, AT(2) receptor mRNA was expressed in 8% and 13%, respectively, of cardiomyocytes gained from control (n = 4) and sham-operated animals (n = 4) and in 14% isolated after myocardial infarction (n = 4). These results demonstrate for the first time that the AT(2) receptor is expressed in adult cardiomyocytes in vivo. They further suggest that the previously observed up-regulation of cardiac AT(1) and AT(2) receptors after myocardial infarction involves cell types other than cardiomyocytes.","The American journal of pathology","10934163",2000,"United States"

This study was undertaken to show how the presence and distribution of collagen IV and laminin, and their ligands (integrin alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 components), can reveal histoarchitectural differences which distinguish these two entities.METHODS AND RESULTS: Five cases of ACC and five cases of PLGA from the archives of the Oral Pathology Department of the School of Dentistry of the S<U+00E3>o Paulo University were submitted to immunostaining with the antibodies to collagen IV, laminin, and integrins alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Positive and negative controls were included. PLGA showed a thin line of collagen IV and laminin surrounding structures composed of a single cell layer. Integrins were expressed as a widespread and granular pattern. A thick line of collagen and laminin was observed around the neoplastic structures of ACC. Both integrins were expressed in intercellular spaces and around luminal spaces of tubular structures.CONCLUSIONS: Collagen IV and laminin, and their integrin ligands, are useful in demonstrating that neoplastic ductal units of PLGA are composed of a single cell layer, being distinct from ACC which contains structures composed of two layers of neoplastic cells.","Histopathology","10931234",2000,"England"
"Cardiac glycosides stimulate Ca2+ increases and apoptosis in androgen-independent, metastatic human prostate adenocarcinoma cells.","Cardiac glycosides are used clinically to increase contractile force in patients with cardiac disorders. Their mechanism of action is well established and involves inhibition of the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase, leading to alterations in intracellular K+ and Ca(2+) levels. Here, we report that the cardiac glycosides oleandrin, ouabain, and digoxin induce apoptosis in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. Cell death was associated with early release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, followed by proteolytic processing of caspases 8 and 3. Oleandrin also promoted caspase activation, detected by cleavage poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and hydrolysis of a peptide substrate (DEVD-pNA). Comparison of the rates of apoptosis in poorly metastatic PC3 M-Pro4 and highly metastatic PC3 M-LN4 subclones demonstrated that cell death was delayed in the latter because of a delay in mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Single-cell imaging of intracellular Ca(2+) fluxes demonstrated that the proapoptotic effects of the cardiac glycosides were linked to their abilities to induce sustained Ca(2+) increases in the cells. Our results define a novel activity for cardiac glycosides that could prove relevant to the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.","Cancer research","10919654",2000,"United States"
"Application of a single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay to screen the antimutagenic activity in foods.","Three cell lines (HL60, U937 and RAW264.7) were studied for their sensitivity against mutagens by using a single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. RAW264.7, the most sensitive one, was chosen to screen the antimutagenic activity in swine and bovine offal.

"Single cell analysis of cytokine expression kinetics by human CD4+ T-cell clones during activation or tolerance induction.","Exposure to optimal peptide antigen concentrations induces human CD4+ T-cell clones to proliferate and secrete various cytokines. Higher (&gt; 10-fold optimal) antigen concentrations cause long-term proliferative unresponsiveness, which can be reversed by exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). We call this condition 'tolerance'. We used intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis to investigate the kinetics of interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5 production during the initial phase of tolerance induction. Single cell analysis of interferon-gamma and IL-4 or IL-5 coexpression showed functional heterogeneity of cloned human CD4+ T cells. Superstimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (PI) revealed enhanced responsiveness shortly after tolerizing treatment, followed by reduced responsiveness. Both tolerized and activated T cells had similarly reduced cytokine responses when further stimulated with antigen during the following 48 hr, with limited enhancement following additional stimulation with PI. We conclude that cytokine induction is normally followed by a refractory phase, but that the expression of cytokines is enhanced in the initial phase of tolerance induction.","Immunology","10886397",2000,"England"
"Gene expression and function of FMRFamide-related neuropeptides in the snail Lymnaea.","FMRFamide and a large family of related peptides (FaRPs) have been identified in every major metazoan phylum examined, including chordates. In the pulmonate snail Lymnaea this family of neuropeptides is encoded by a five-exon locus that is subject to alternative splicing. The two alternative mRNA transcripts are expressed in the CNS in a mutually exclusive manner at the single cell level, resulting in the differential distribution of the distinct sets of FaRPs that they encode in defined neuronal networks. Biochemical peptide purification, single-cell analysis by mass spectroscopy, and immunocytochemistry have led to an understanding of the post-translational processing patterns of the two alternative precursor proteins and identified at least 12 known and novel peptides contained in neuronal networks involved in cardiorespiration, penial control and withdrawal response. The pharmacological actions of single or co-expressed peptides are beginning to emerge for the cardiorespiratory network and its central and peripheral targets. Peptides derived from protein precursor 1 and contained in the heart excitatory central motoneurons E(he) have distinct functions and also act in concert in cardiac regulation, based on their unique effects on heartbeat and their differential stimulatory effects on second messenger pathways. Precursor-2 derived peptides, contained in the Visceral White Interneuron, a key neuron of the cardiorespiratory network, have mostly inhibitory effects on the VWI's central postsynaptic target neurons but with some of the peptides also exhibiting excitatory effects on the same cells.","Microscopy research and technique","10862111",2000,"United States"
"G(i)-dependent suppression of beta(1)-adrenoceptor effects in ventricular myocytes from NE-treated guinea pigs.","It has been suggested that there is a preferential coupling in heart muscle between the inhibitory G protein (G(i)) and the beta(2)-subtype of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR), since pertussis toxin (which inactivates G(i)) reveals latent beta(2)-ARs in rat and mouse myocytes. We have previously shown that guinea pigs treated with norepinephrine (NE) for 7 days have myocytes that are desensitized to beta-AR-agonist stimulation, and that pertussis toxin restores these responses. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether pertussis toxin specifically upregulated beta(2)-ARs in myocytes from NE-treated guinea pigs. The sole beta-AR subtype in control guinea pig myocytes was confirmed as beta(1)-AR by radioligand binding, single-cell autoradiography, and concentration-response curves to isoproterenol in contracting myocytes. In contrast, a minor pool of beta(2)-ARs was observed in rat myocytes by use of the same methods. NE treatment decreased the maximum isoproterenol response (relative to high Ca(2+)) from 0.89 +/- 0.06 to 0.58 +/- 0.08 (n = 7, P &lt; 0.01) and the pD(2) (-log EC(50)) from 8.8 +/- 0.2 to 7.5 +/- 0.2 (n = 7, P &lt; 0.01). Pertussis toxin treatment increased the isoproterenol-to-Ca(2+) ratio to 0.88 +/- 0.04 (n = 6, P &lt; 0.05) and the pD(2) to 8.6 +/- 0.3 (P &lt; 0.01). This was not mediated by increases in either number or function of beta(2)-ARs. G(i) is therefore able to modulate beta(1)-AR responses in guinea pig myocytes.","American journal of physiology.

"TASK (TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ channel) is expressed in glomerulosa cells of rat adrenal cortex and inhibited by angiotensin II.","The present study was conducted to explore the possible contribution of a recently described leak K+ channel, TASK (TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ channel), to the high resting K+ conductance of adrenal glomerulosa cells. Northern blot analysis showed the strongest TASK message in adrenal glomerulosa (capsular) tissue among the examined tissues including heart and brain. Single-cell PCR demonstrated TASK expression in glomerulosa cells. In patch-clamp experiments performed on isolated glomerulosa cells the inward current at -100 mV in 30 mM [K+] (reflecting mainly potassium conductance) was pH sensitive (17+/-2% reduction when the pH changed from 7.4 to 6.7). In Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA prepared from adrenal glomerulosa tissue the expressed K+ current at -100 mV was virtually insensitive to tetraethylammonium (3 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (3 mM). Ba2+ (300 microM) and Cs+ (3 mM) induced voltage-dependent block. Lidocaine (1 mM) and extracellular acidification from pH 7.5 to 6.7 inhibited the current (by 28% and 16%, respectively). This inhibitory profile is similar (although it is not identical) to that of TASK expressed by injecting its cRNA. In oocytes injected with adrenal glomerulosa mRNA, TASK antisense oligonucleotide reduced significantly the expression of K+ current at -100 mV, while the sense oligonucleotide failed to have inhibitory effect. Application of angiotensin II (10 nM) both in isolated glomerulosa cells and in oocytes injected with adrenal glomerulosa mRNA inhibited the K+ current at -100 mV. Similarly, in oocytes coexpressing TASK and ATla angiotensin II receptor, angiotensin II inhibited the TASK current. These data together indicate that TASK contributes to the generation of high resting potassium permeability of glomerulosa cells, and this background K+ channel may be a target of hormonal regulation.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)","10847588",2000,"United States"
"Perillyl alcohol inhibits TCR-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) signaling, alters cell shape and motility, and induces apoptosis in T lymphocytes.","Perillyl alcohol (POH) inhibits isoprenylation and has shown anticancer and chemopreventive properties in rodent models. The mechanism that underlies the anticancer activity of POH and other isoprenylation inhibitors is unknown but has been postulated to involve decreased levels of isoprenylated Ras and Ras-related proteins. Previously we demonstrated that POH effectively inhibits human T cell proliferation in vitro and can prevent acute and chronic rejection in a rat cardiac transplant model. In this report, we investigate the effects of POH on T lymphocytes at the single-cell level. POH disrupts the polarized shape and motility of antigen-specific murine 1E5 T cells. Using an optical trap to position anti-CD3-coated beads in contact with 1E5 T cells, we demonstrate that POH inhibits their TCR-mediated calcium response. Furthermore, we show that POH preferentially induces apoptosis in PHA-activated human T cells as well as in 1E5 T cells.","Cellular immunology","10805968",2000,"United States"
"Rodent nerve-muscle cell culture system for studies of neuromuscular junction development: refinements and applications.","Understanding of vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development has been advanced by experimentation with cultures of dissociated embryonic nerve and skeletal muscle cells, particularly those derived from Xenopus and chick embryos. We previously developed a rodent (rat) nerve-muscle coculture system that is characterized by extensive induction of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregation at sites of axonal contact with myotubes (Dutton et al., 1995). In this article, we report modifications of this culture system and examples of its application to the study of NMJ development: (1) We describe improved methods for the enrichment of myoblasts to give higher yields of myotubes with equal or greater purity. (2) We demonstrate lipophilic dye labeling of axons in cocultures by injection of dye into neuron aggregates and show the feasibility of studying the growth of living axons on myotubes during synapse formation. (3) We describe the preparation of a better-defined coculture system containing myotubes with purified rat motoneurons and characterize the system with respect to axon-induced AChR aggregation. (4) We demonstrate dependence of the pattern of axon-induced AChR aggregation on muscle cell species, by the use of chick-rat chimeric co-cultures. (5) We provide evidence for the role of alternatively-spliced agrin isoforms in synapse formation by using single cell RT-PCR with neurons collected from co-cultures after observation of axon-induced AChR aggregation.

"Enhanced cardiac contractility after gene transfer of V2 vasopressin receptors In vivo by ultrasound-guided injection or transcoronary delivery.","BACKGROUND: Systemic levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) are increased in congestive heart failure, resulting in vasoconstriction and reduced cardiac contractility via V(1) vasopressin receptors. V(2) vasopressin receptors (V2Rs), which promote activation of adenylyl cyclase, are physiologically expressed only in the kidney and are absent in the myocardium. Heterologous expression of V2Rs in the myocardium could result in a positive inotropic effect by using the endogenous high concentrations of AVP in heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested gene transfer with a recombinant adenovirus for the human V2R (Ad-V2R) to stimulate contractility of rat or rabbit myocardium in vivo. Ultrasound-guided direct injection or transcoronary delivery of adenovirus in vivo resulted in recombinant receptor expression in the myocardial target area, leading to a substantial increase in [(3)H]AVP binding. In 50% of the cardiomyocytes isolated from the directly injected area, single-cell shortening measurements detected a significant increase in contraction amplitude after exposure to AVP or the V2R-specific desmopressin (DDAVP). Echocardiography of the target myocardial area documented a marked increase in local fractional shortening after systemic administration of DDAVP in V2R-expressing animals but not in control virus-treated hearts. Simultaneous measurement of global contractility (dP/dt(max)) confirmed a positive inotropic effect of DDAVP on left ventricular function in the Ad-V2R-injected animals.CONCLUSIONS: Adenoviral gene transfer of the V2R into the myocardium increases cardiac contractility in vivo. Heterologous expression of cAMP-forming receptors in the myocardium could lead to novel strategies in the therapy of congestive heart failure by bypassing the desensitized beta-adrenergic receptor-signaling cascade.","Circulation","10747352",2000,"United States"
"Study on DNA strand breaks induced by sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor, in vivo and in vitro.","Nitric oxide (NO) as well as its donors has been shown to generate mutation and DNA damage in in vitro assays. The objective of this study was to identify that DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) could be elicited by NO, not only in vitro but also in vivo. The alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) was performed to examine the DNA damage in g12 cells and the cells isolated from the organs of mice exposed to sodium nitroprusside (SNP). A modified method, in which neither collagenase nor trypsin was necessary, was used to prepare the single-cell suspension isolated from organs of mice. Results showed that the exposure of g12 cells to 0.13-0.5 micromol/ml SNP with S9 for 1 h induced a concentration-dependent increase in DNA SSBs in g12 cells. The significant increase in DNA migration and comet frequency has appeared in the cells isolated from the spleen, thymus, and peritoneal macrophages of mice after injecting i.p. SNP in the dosage range of 0.67-6.0 mg/kg b.wt for 1 h. However, no obvious increase in DNA strand breaks was observed in the cells isolated from the liver, kidney, lung, brain and heart obtained from the same treated mice. These results suggested that DNA SSBs could be induced by NO in some cells both in vivo and in vitro. There were organ differences in sensitivity in the mice exposed to NO. Spleen, thymus, and macrophages might be the important targets of NO.","Mutation research","10727906",2000,"Netherlands"
"Direct electrochemical measurement of nitric oxide in vascular endothelium.","The endothelium plays a critical role in maintaining vascular tone by releasing vasoconstrictor and vasodilator substances. Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is a vasodilator rapidly inactivated by superoxide and by Fe(II) and Fe(III), all found in significant quantities in biological systems. Thus due to the short life of NO in tissue (t1/2 = 3-6 s), in situ quantification of NO is a challenging problem. We designed the present study to perform direct measurements of nitric oxide using the electrochemical porphyrinic sensor. The most significant advantages of this sensor is small size (0.5-8 microm), rapid response time (0.1-1 ms), and low detection limit (10(-9) mol l(-1)). The porphyrinic sensor was used for in vitro and in vivo measurements of NO in an isolated single cell or tissue. Effects of hypertension, endotoxemia, and ischemia/reperfusion on the release of NO and/or its interaction with superoxide (O2-) were delineated. In the single endothelial cell (rabbit endocardium), NO concentration was highest at the cell membrane (950 +/- 50 nmol l(-1)), decreasing exponentially with distance from cell, and becoming undetectable at distances beyond 50 microm. The endothelium of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) released 35% less NO (580 +/- 30 nmol l(-1)) than that of normotensive rats (920 +/- 50 nmol l(-1)), due to the higher production of O2- in SHR rats. Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) generated NO (140 +/- 20 nmol l(-1)) in lung during the acute phase (first 10-15 min) of endotoxemia, followed by production of NO by inducible NOS. High production of O2- was observed during the entire period of endotoxemia. Ischemia (lower limb of rabbit) caused a significant increase of NO peaking at 15 min and decreasing thereafter, also due to O2- production.","Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis","10698575",2000,"United States"
"A combined subchronic (90-day) toxicity and neurotoxicity study of a single-cell source of docosahexaenoic acid triglyceride (DHASCO oil).","Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a 22-carbon long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid of the omega-3 family, is a major structural component of neural membranes and is a particularly important nutrient during infant development. New safe and well-defined sources of DHA are required for infant formula fortification and dietary supplementation. DHASCO oil is an algal-derived triglyceride containing 40-50% DHA. Previous studies have shown that DHASCO oil is neither mutagenic nor toxic in acute or 28-day subchronic tests. To further establish the safety of this oil, a 90-day subchronic toxicity study in rats which included haematology, clinical chemistry, pathology and ophthalmologic, neurobehavioural and neuropathological assessments, using doses of 0.5 and 1.25g/kg body weight/day was performed. There were no treatment-related adverse effects in any of the parameters measured at either dose. Based on these results, the no-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for DHASCO oil under the conditions of this study corresponds to the highest dose level. The DHA in the DHASCO oil was bioavailable, resulting in significant elevations in the levels of this fatty acid in liver, heart and brain after 90 days of administration. In conclusion, this 90-day subchronic toxicity study provides additional evidence that DHASCO oil is a safe and bioavailable source of dietary DHA.","Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association","10685012",2000,"England"
"High-efficiency, long-term cardiac expression of foreign genes in living mouse embryos and neonates.","BACKGROUND: The development of improved strategies for efficient and reproducible in vivo gene transfer into the murine heart will ultimately allow the intersection of somatic and germline gene transfer strategies to study complex features of cardiac biology and diseases.METHODS AND RESULTS: For embryonic gene transfer, an adenovirus vector expressing beta-galactosidase was injected in utero into the ventricular cavity of living embryos via microsurgical approaches. The injected embryos were developed to term, and efficient expression of the transgene was detected in all cell types in the heart. For postnatal cardiac gene transfer, adenovirus was injected into the cardiac ventricle of neonatal mice, resulting in efficient expression of the transgene in the outer layer of the myocardium as well as cardiomyocytes in the middle and inner layers of the cardiac wall. Mice examined after 3 weeks displayed a pattern of expression that completely mimicked the pattern seen after 3 days, and gene expression was also found after 6 months. The infected myocytes can be identified by coinfection of an adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein without affecting their normal physiological function.CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new strategy to achieve efficient and long-term foreign gene expression in both embryonic and postnatal mouse myocardium via direct intracardiac injection of recombinant adenovirus. The strategy should allow the functional assessment of the expression of dominantly acting exogenous genes, overexpression of wild-type genes, and Cre recombinase-mediated gene ablations at the single-cell level in the context of the intact adult mouse myocardium.","Circulation","10637206",2000,"United States"
"Sinusoidal stimulation of myocardial tissue: effects on single cells.","INTRODUCTION: Cardiac tissue subjected to sinusoidal stimulus is characterized by action potentials (APs) that have extended plateau phases, sustained for the duration of the stimulus. Extended action potential durations (APDs) are beneficial because they disrupt wandering wavelets in the fibrillating heart. To investigate the mechanisms by which periodic stimulus affects cardiac tissue, particularly the development of sustained depolarization, computer simulations of single cardiac cells exposed to alternating current (AC) are performed.METHODS AND RESULTS: Two modes of stimulation of the cell are examined: external field stimulation and transmembrane current injection. Several membrane models, including Luo-Rudy I and II, are used in the simulations. External AC field stimuli increase the APD of the single cell. The extended plateau of the cellular AP is characterized by periodic oscillations that are 1:2 phase locked with the applied stimulus. This specific behavior is due to the variations in stimulus magnitude and polarity along the cell border, which elicit opposite electrical responses from the cell sides. These pointwise responses are averaged in the macroscopic cellular response and result in sustained oscillatory depolarization that lasts for the duration of the stimulus. In contrast, the cell undergoing current injection does not develop an extended APD.CONCLUSION: The simulations demonstrate that variation of membrane potential within a cell is of paramount importance to the formation of an extended AP plateau in response to AC stimulation.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","10636192",2000,"United States"
"The biphasic mystery: why a biphasic shock is more effective than a monophasic shock for defibrillation.","We demonstrate that a biphasic shock is more effective than a monophasic shock at eliminating reentrant electrical activity in an ionic model of cardiac ventricular electrical activity. This effectiveness results from early hyperpolarization that enhances the recovery of sodium inactivation, thereby enabling earlier activation of recovering cells. The effect can be seen easily in a model of a single cell and also in a cable model with a ring of excitable cells. Finally, we demonstrate the phenomenon in a two-dimensional model of cardiac tissue.","Journal of theoretical biology","10479536",1999,"England"
"Genotoxic studies of vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)) in male mice. II. Effects in several mouse tissues.","Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was tested for its ability to induce genotoxic damage in six different organs (liver, kidney, lung, spleen, heart, and bone marrow) of mice by using the alkaline Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) assay. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after i.p. administration of the vanadium pentoxide of 23.0, 11.5, or 5.75 microg/g (corresponding to the LD50, 1/2 LD50 and 1/4 LD50, respectively). In all tissues and organs evaluated (except for bone marrow), V2O5 increased the number of cells with damage. Our results showed that i.p. injection of V2O5 induced DNA damage in different organs and tissues, and that this kind of damage can be observed even 24 h after treatment. The analysis of DNA migration and the distribution of DNA damage showed that there are differences in sensitivity between organs and tissues to this compound. In addition the sensitivity of SCGE assay allows the detection of long term DNA damage and the possibility to compare it in various tissues and target organs.","Teratogenesis, carcinogenesis, and mutagenesis","10406888",1999,"United States"
"A single cell model of myocardial reperfusion injury: changes in intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations in guinea pig ventricular myocytes.","To investigate the contribution of the changes in intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations ([Na+]i and [Ca2+]i) to myocardial reperfusion injury, we made an ischemia/reperfusion model in intact guinea pig myocytes. Myocardial ischemia was simulated by the perfusion of metabolic inhibitors (3.3 mM amobarbital and 5 microM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) with pH 6.6 and reperfusion was achieved by the washout of them with pH 7.4. [Na+]i increased from 7.9 +/- 2.0 to 14.0 +/- 3.4 mM (means +/- S.E., p &lt; 0.01 ) during 7.5 min of simulated ischemia (SI) and increased further to 18.8 +/- 3.0 mM at 7.5 min after reperfusion. [Ca2+]i, expressed as the ratio of fluo 3 fluorescence intensity, increased to 133 +/- 8% (p &lt; 0.01) during SI and gradually returned to the control level after reperfusion. Intracellular pH decreased from 7.53 +/- 0.04 to 6.31 +/- 0.04 (p &lt; 0.01) and recovered quickly after reperfusion. Reperfusion with the acidic solution or the continuous perfusion of hexamethylene amiloride (2 microM) prevented the reperfusion-induced increase in [Na+]i. When the duration of SI was prolonged to 15 min, the cell response after reperfusion varied, 16 of 37 cells kept quiescent, 21 cells showed spontaneous Ca2+ waves, and 4 cells out of these 21 cells became hypercontracted. In quiescent cells, both [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i decreased immediately after reperfusion. In cells with Ca2+ waves, [Na+]i transiently increased further at the early phase of reperfusion, while [Ca2+]i declined. In hypercontracted cells, [Na+]i increased as much as in 'Ca2+ wave' cells, but [Ca2+]i increased extensively and both ion concentrations continued to increase. Reperfusion with the Ca2+-free solution prevented both the [Ca2+]i increase and morphological change. In the presence of ryanodine (10 microM), the increase in [Ca2+]i after reperfusion was augmented and some cells became hypercontracted. We concluded that (1) Na+/H+ exchange is active both during SI and reperfusion, resulting in the additional [Na+]i elevation on reperfusion, (2) the [Na+]i level after reperfusion and the following Ca2+ influx via Na+/Ca2+ exchange are crucial for reperfusion cell injury, and (3) the Ca2+ buffering capacity of sarcoplasmic reticulum would also contribute to the Ca2+ regulation and cell injury after reperfusion.","Molecular and cellular biochemistry","10391134",1999,"Netherlands"
"Interstitial cellular and matrix restoration of cardiac valves after cryopreservation.","OBJECTIVES: We previously characterized the porcine aortic leaflet interstitial cell phenotype as having both synthetic and contractile characteristics; that is, it is a myofibroblast. In this study we hypothesized (1) that the cryopreservation of aortic valves causes a significant reduction in cell density, (2) that it simultaneously causes alterations in representative components of extracellular matrix, and (3) that both of these processes are reversible.METHODS: Seventy-two leaflets from 24 porcine aortic valves were studied. Whole valves were subjected to variable lengths of preharvest ischemia (group 1), ischemia followed by processing analogous to clinical methods (group 2), and ischemia followed processing with an organ culture type of resuscitation (group 3). Vital dye exclusion by cells enzymatically dispersed from leaflets was used to quantify viability. Electron and light microscopy, immunohistochemical assay, and a silicone rubber substratum contractility assay were used both in dispersed cell preparations and in leaflet cross sections to examine structural, ultrastructural, and functional changes across the 3 groups through a range of preharvest ischemic times.RESULTS: Results indicated that harvest ischemic periods between 2 and 24 hours after donor death were not responsible for cell number reductions. During this interval overt dissolution of chondroitin sulfate simultaneous with a relative sparing of fibronectin was evidenced by immunohistochemical staining. Although not reduced in number, ischemic interstitial cells did show significant ultrastructural evidence of injury and suppressed monoclonal binding to vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. After cryopreservation, viable cell numbers were always markedly reduced at all ischemic intervals and damage to both soluble extracellular matrix components and cell ultrastructure was increased. At all time and processing points, however, some retention of matrix secretory and cellular contractile capabilities was observed among the surviving cells. After the extended periods of preharvest ischemia (2-24 hours) followed by processing, a restitution of functioning cells was accomplished by means of whole-leaflet incubation in 15% fetal bovine serum.CONCLUSIONS: After application of the described methods, new cells within restored intact leaflets as well as in single-cell preparations demonstrated normal ultrastructure and contractile and synthetic functions (normal phenotypic expression). If functioning leaflet interstitial cells can contribute to homograft durability, bioengineering methods for pretransplantation cell repopulation could be refined with these techniques and applied to clinical valve transplantation.","The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery","10384183",1999,"United States"
"BR96 sFv-PE40 immunotoxin: nonclinical safety assessment.","BR96 sFv-PE40, a recombinant DNA-derived fusion protein composed of the heavy- and light-chain variable region domains of the monoclonal antibody BR96 and the translocation and catalytic domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors expressing cell surface Lewis(y)-related antigens. Single- and repeat-dose intravenous toxicity studies in rats and dogs and a comparative ex vivo tissue-binding study with rat, dog, and human tissues were conducted to assess the toxicity of BR96 sFv-PE40 and to estimate a safe starting dose in humans. Additional studies were performed to investigate the prevention of pulmonary vascular-leak syndrome, the dose-limiting toxicity of BR96 sFv-PE40 in rats, and the immunogenicity of BR96 sFv-PE40. In single-dose studies in rats, the vascular leak appeared to be primarily confined to the lungs; however, with a repeat-dose regimen (every other day for 5 doses) other organs including the brain and heart were involved at lethal doses (12-15 mg/m2 cumulative). Single doses of 1.8 mg/m2 and a cumulative 3.8 mg/m2 dose (0.75 mg/m2, every other day for 5 doses) were generally well tolerated in rats. These doses are significantly greater than doses required to cure rodents bearing human tumor xenografts. In dogs, the major target organ following single or repeated doses (every 3 days for 5 doses) was the pancreas. Morphologic changes in the exocrine pancreas ranged from atrophy with single-cell necrosis to diffuse acinar necrosis. After a 1-mo dose-free observation period, no residual pancreatic toxicity was observed in dogs given single doses up to 6.0 mg/m2 or 5 doses of 2.4 mg/m2 (12 mg/m2 cumulative). No significant pancreatic toxicity was observed at doses &lt;0.6 mg/m2 in high Lewis(y)-expressing dogs. Assessment of trypsinlike immunoreactivity was useful in monitoring changes in pancreatic function. The immunogenicity of BR96 sFv-PE40 could be inhibited by combined treatment with an immunosuppressant in dogs, thus maintaining exposure to BR96 sFv-PE40.","Toxicologic pathology","10367679",1999,"United States"
"Histology and ultrastructure of liver and kidney following blood exchange with ultrapurified, polymerised bovine hemoglobin in comparison with hydroxyethyl starch.","Because of their oxygen binding capacity, cell-free hemoglobin solutions are promising blood substitutes. However, their clinical use has so far been limited by toxic side effects on liver and kidney until ultrapurification and chemical modifications have been established in the production process of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. The present study has been designed to examine structural changes of liver and kidney by light and electron microscopy after complete isovolemic blood exchange with a new ultrapurified bovine hemoglobin solution (UPBH-2) in eight beagle dogs. The results have been compared with a sham-operated control and eight animals having undergone blood exchange with hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a clinically used colloidal volume substitute. In the kidney, no changes were observed after blood exchange with UPBH-2 as compared with the sham control. These findings indicate sufficient tissue oxygenation and lack of renal toxicity. In contrast, histological signs of severe proximal tubular damage, eg, wide lumina, cytoplasmic protrusions, brush-border defects, and tubular necroses, were seen after blood exchange with HES. These changes are consistent with hypoxic tissue damage. In the liver, a slight increase in the number of single cell necroses was observed after UPBH-2 treatment as well as after blood exchange with HES. At the ultrastructural level, partial loss of microvilli and cytoplasmic protrusions of hepatocytes as well as swelling of endothelial cells were present in both groups, but slightly more pronounced in the UPBH-2 group. In all UPBH-2-treated animals, a marked diminution of glycogen-granula in hepatocytes was observed indicating an influence of UPBH-2 upon glycogen metabolism. Whereas the alterations of hepatocytes after nearly complete blood exchange with HES can be interpreted as a consequence of tissue hypoxia, the ultrastructural changes after UPBH-2 treatment cannot be attributed to hypoxic conditions, because improved tissue oxygenation has been demonstrated during treatment with UPBH-2. Hepatocyte damage was very discrete and comparable with the alterations observed after HES treatment. Hence, major hepatotoxicity can be excluded. The absence of significant adverse effects on the ultrastructural integrity of the kidney indicates that UPBH-2, owing to ultrapurification and polymerization, is an oxygen-carrying hemoglobin without acute renal toxicity.","Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology","10334568",1999,"United States"

Rather, we have confirmed, conceivably ad nauseum, that M cells do exist and contribute importantly to the expression of electrical activity in the intact myocardium. What controversy there is relates to (1) whether there is an inhomogeneous transmural gradient for ventricular repolarization in normal hearts, and (2) why the electrophysiologic properties of different myocardial sites differ so markedly at the level of the isolated tissue and single cell and yet become so much more homogenous in the intact ventricle. These issues are addressed on the following pages.","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","10090229",1999,"United States"
"Action potential propagation failures in long-term recordings from embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in tissue culture.","Three-dimensional cell aggregates (embryoid bodies, EBs) containing clusters of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes were derived from permanent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Extracellular recordings of the population action potentials of cardiomyocyte clusters were made using permanently mounted silver wire electrodes and microelectrode arrays integrated into the bottom of the culture dish. These techniques allowed long-term recordings (for up to several weeks) from individual EBs under cell culture conditions. The normal electrical activity consisted of regular spiking with a frequency of 0.5-5 Hz. However, most EBs (87%) spontaneously developed temporary or persistent complex activity patterns because of intermittent block of action potential propagation at narrow pathways connecting larger beating areas. Similar propagation blocks could also be reversibly induced in regularly spiking EBs by nimodipine (NDP). In addition to a slowing of pacemaker activity, NDP (20-200 nM) induced a stepwise decrease of the action potential frequency at the recording site. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from enzymatically isolated ES-cell-derived cardiomyocytes showed that similar activity patterns do not occur at the single-cell level. We suggest that this novel approach may provide a useful tool for in vitro studies of chronotropy and phenomena of propagation failure similar to AV block.","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","10087143",1999,"Germany"
"Mechanism linking T-wave alternans to the genesis of cardiac fibrillation.","BACKGROUND: Although T-wave alternans has been closely associated with vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias, the cellular processes underlying T-wave alternans and their role, if any, in the mechanism of reentry remain unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: -T-wave alternans on the surface ECG was elicited in 8 Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts during fixed-rate pacing while action potentials were recorded simultaneously from 128 epicardial sites with voltage-sensitive dyes. Alternans of the repolarization phase of the action potential was observed above a critical threshold heart rate (HR) (209+/-46 bpm) that was significantly lower (by 57+/-36 bpm) than the HR threshold for alternation of action potential depolarization. The magnitude (range, 2.7 to 47.0 mV) and HR threshold (range, 171 to 272 bpm) of repolarization alternans varied substantially between cells across the epicardial surface. T-wave alternans on the surface ECG was explained primarily by beat-to-beat alternation in the time course of cellular repolarization. Above a critical HR, membrane repolarization alternated with the opposite phase between neighboring cells (ie, discordant alternans), creating large spatial gradients of repolarization. In the presence of discordant alternans, a small acceleration of pacing cycle length produced a characteristic sequence of events: (1) unidirectional block of an impulse propagating against steep gradients of repolarization, (2) reentrant propagation, and (3) the initiation of ventricular fibrillation.CONCLUSIONS: Repolarization alternans at the level of the single cell accounts for T-wave alternans on the surface ECG. Discordant alternans produces spatial gradients of repolarization of sufficient magnitude to cause unidirectional block and reentrant ventricular fibrillation. These data establish a mechanism linking T-wave alternans of the ECG to the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death.","Circulation","10077525",1999,"United States"
"Adenoviral gene transfer of the human V2 vasopressin receptor improves contractile force of rat cardiomyocytes.","BACKGROUND: In congestive heart failure, high systemic levels of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) result in vasoconstriction and reduced cardiac contractility. These effects are mediated by the V1 vasopressin receptor (V1R) coupled to phospholipase C beta-isoforms. The V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), which promotes activation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system, is physiologically expressed in the kidney but not in the myocardium. Expression of a recombinant V2R (rV2R) in the myocardium could result in a positive inotropic effect via the endogenous high concentrations of AVP in heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: A recombinant adenovirus encoding the human V2R (Ad-V2R) was tested for its ability to modulate the cardiac Gs/adenylyl cyclase system and to potentiate contractile force in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Ad-V2R infection resulted in a virus concentration-dependent expression of the transgene and led to a marked increase in cAMP formation in rV2R-expressing cardiomyocytes after exposure to AVP. Single-cell shortening measurements showed a significant agonist-induced contraction amplitude enhancement, which was blocked by the V2R antagonist, SR 121463A. Pretreatment of Ad-V2R-infected cardiomyocytes with AVP led to desensitization of the rV2R after short-term agonist exposure but did not lead to further loss of receptor function or density after long-term agonist incubation, thus demonstrating resistance of the rV2R to downregulation.CONCLUSIONS: Adenoviral gene transfer of the V2R in cardiomyocytes can modulate the endogenous adenylyl cyclase-signal transduction cascade and can potentiate contraction amplitude in cardiomyocytes. Heterologous expression of cAMP-forming receptors in the myocardium could lead to novel strategies in congestive heart failure by bypassing the desensitized beta-adrenergic receptor signaling.","Circulation","10027817",1999,"United States"
"Histochemical method for localization of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals in the intact neonatal brain.","The generation of reactive oxygen species has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases of the central nervous system. Often these pathological conditions involve damage to specific cell types within selected areas of the brain. Thus, there is a marked need for a method which allows microscopic visualization/detection of these oxygen radicals in discrete brain areas. We are reporting a method to histochemically localize, with single cell resolution, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen radicals in the neonatal brain in vivo. This method expands on the technique developed to visualize H2O2 and the superoxide anion radical (O2-) in isolated perfused organs (e.g., lung, heart) (Bobbs, 1994). With our technique, the intact brain is perfused intracardially with warm oxygenated saline to remove blood, followed by perfusion with buffers containing either iron and diethylenetriaminepentaacetate for the detection of H2O2 or manganese for the detection of oxygen radicals. The free radical oxidizes its respective metal, which in turn oxidizes diaminobenzidine (DAB) to form a brown reaction product which can be visualized using light microscopy.","Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology","10022027",1999,"United States"
"LPS-induced TNF-alpha release from and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes: obligatory role for CD14 in mediating the LPS response.","The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contributes to the cardiovascular collapse and death observed in patients with sepsis. Because LPS has such profound effects on cardiac performance, we speculate that direct effects of LPS could be demonstrated on cardiomyocytes in culture, and that these direct effects are mediated by the LPS receptor, CD14. Accordingly, in this study, we provide evidence for CD14-dependent cardiotoxic effects of LPS including the LPS-stimulated secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) from cardiomyocytes. TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine which is known for its negative inotropic effects on cardiac performance, but has not until recently been shown to be produced by cardiac cells. In this study, LPS was found to stimulate strongly in a dose-dependent manner the secretion of TNF-alpha from cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes. Further, LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion was blocked by an inhibitor of TNF-alpha processing, metallomatrix protease inhibitor (TAPI). Molecular and immunological evidence demonstrated the presence of LPS receptors (CD14) on cardiomyocytes. Attenuated TNF-alpha secretion following PI-PLC treatment confirmed the functional importance of CD14 for LPS-mediated myocardial effects. Importantly, LPS also triggered apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes as quantified by single-cell gel electrophoresis of nuclei exhibiting DNA fragmentation patterns characteristic of apoptosis (i.e. cardiac comets). Apoptotic cell death was blocked by pre-incubation with the soluble TNF-alpha receptor fragment (TNFRII:Fc), suggesting that LPS-induced apoptosis was TNF-alpha-dependent and probably involved an autocrine function for the TNF-alpha whose secretion was under LPS control. The results of this study suggest that the cardiodepressant effects of LPS are dependent on CD14 signaling and may not only be due to acute negative inotropic effects of TNF-alpha but also may be complicated by TNF-alpha-induced apoptotic cell death which effectively reduces the number of working myocardial cells.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","9990546",1999,"United States"
"Dietary flavonols protect diabetic human lymphocytes against oxidative damage to DNA.","Diabetic patients have reduced antioxidant defenses and suffer from an increased risk of free radical-mediated diseases such as coronary heart disease. Epidemiological evidence has suggested that antioxidant dietary flavonoids may protect against heart disease, but a biological effect has yet to be demonstrated directly in humans. In this study, 10 stable type 2 diabetic patients were treated for 2 weeks on a low-flavonol diet and for 2 weeks on the same diet supplemented with 76-110 mg of flavonols (mostly quercetin) provided by 400 g of onions (and tomato sauce) and six cups of tea daily. Freshly collected lymphocytes were subjected to standard oxidative challenge with hydrogen peroxide, and DNA damage was measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis. Fasting plasma flavonol concentrations (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography) were 5.6 +/- 2.9 ng/ml on the low-flavonol diet and increased 12-fold to 72.1 +/- 15.8 ng/ml on the high-flavonol diet (P &lt; 0.001). Oxidative damage to lymphocyte DNA was 220 +/- 12 on an arbitrary scale of 0-400 U on the low-flavonol diet and 192 +/- 14 on the high-flavonol diet (P = 0.037). This decrease was not accounted for by any change in the measurements of diabetic control (fasting plasma glucose or fructosamine) or by any change in the plasma levels of known antioxidants, including vitamin C, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, urate, albumin, and bilirubin. In conclusion, we have shown a biological effect of potential medical importance that appears to be associated with the absorption of dietary flavonols.","Diabetes","9892240",1999,"United States"
"Effect of isoprenaline, carbachol, and Cs+ on Na+ activity and pacemaker potential in rabbit SA node cells.","Effects of isoprenaline, carbachol, and Cs+ on intracellular Na+ activity (a(i)Na) and spontaneous action potentials were studied in multicellular and single cell preparations isolated from rabbit sinoatrial (SA) nodes. a(i)Na was measured with double-barreled Na+-selective microelectrodes and the fluorescent Na+-indicator sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI). In spontaneously beating cells, aiNa measured with Na+-selective microelectrodes and SBFI were 4.5 +/- 1.2 mM (means +/- SD, n = 21) in multicellular preparations and 4.0 +/- 1.1 mM (n = 16) in single cells, respectively. Measurements of a(i)Na with microelectrodes showed that isoprenaline increased a(i)Na from 4.7 +/- 1.2 to 5.5 +/- 1.6 mM (n = 16, P &lt; 0.01) and shortened the action potential cycle length (ACL) from 338 +/- 46 to 269 +/- 35 ms (n = 16, P &lt; 0.01). However, increasing the action potential rate by pacing produced a much smaller increase in a(i)Na. Changes in a(i)Na and ACL produced by isoprenaline were blocked by Cs+. The selective hyperpolarization-activated inward current (If) blocker ZD-7288 decreased a(i)Na from 5.2 +/- 1.0 to 4.6 +/- 1.3 mM (n = 4, P &lt; 0.01) and prolonged ACL from 394 +/- 20 to 553 +/- 68 ms (n = 4, P &lt; 0.01). The If blocker substantially inhibited the increase in a(i)Na produced by isoprenaline. Carbachol and Cs+ decreased aiNa from 4.6 +/- 1.4 to 3.9 +/- 1.2 mM (n = 15, P &lt; 0.01) and from 4.9 +/- 1.0 to 3.9 +/- 1.3 mM (n = 18, P &lt; 0.01), respectively. In addition, carbachol and Cs+ prolonged ACL from 345 +/- 44 to 587 +/- 100 ms (n = 15, P &lt; 0.01) and from 353 +/- 30 to 464 +/- 87 ms (n = 18, P &lt; 0.01), respectively. However, carbachol and Cs+ almost did not change a(i)Na when SA node cells became quiescent in a 25.4 mM extracellular K+ concentration. The results suggest that isoprenaline, ZD-7288, carbachol, or Cs+ might have changed a(i)Na and action potential rate by possibly stimulating or inhibiting If carried by Na+. Measurements of a(i)Na with SBFI showed that isoprenaline, carbachol, and Cs+ produced a(i)Na changes that were similar to those measured with the microelectrodes.","The American journal of physiology","9887034",1999,"United States"
"Serum carotenoids and oxidative DNA damage in human lymphocytes.","Carotenoids are thought to act as antioxidants in vivo, decreasing oxidative damage to biomolecules and thus protecting against coronary heart disease and cancer. However, human intervention studies with beta-carotene have given equivocal results in terms of cancer incidence. In an alternative molecular epidemiological approach, we have employed the 'comet assay' (single cell alkaline gel electrophoresis) to measure strand breaks, oxidized pyrimidines and altered purines in the DNA of lymphocytes from volunteers supplemented with alpha/beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene or placebo. In addition, we measured concentrations of the main serum carotenoids, and vitamins E and C, by HPLC. We report a significant negative correlation between basal concentrations of total serum carotenoids and oxidized pyrimidines. A similar correlation was seen between individual carotenoids (notably lutein and beta-carotene) and oxidized pyrimidines. However, carotenoid supplementation did not have a significant effect on endogenous oxidative damage. This suggests that there are some factors in the basal diet, probably found in fruit and vegetables, that decrease oxidative damage to DNA. In this case, basal serum carotenoids may simply be markers of consumption of fruit and vegetables, they themselves having little or no protective value.","Carcinogenesis","9886572",1999,"England"
"Optimal lipofection reagent varies with the molecular modifications of the DNA.","Cationic lipid reagents differ in their cytofection efficacy with different cell types. No evidence has addressed whether the same lipid reagent is best for different DNAs in a single cell line. Immortalized avian embryonic cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro were tested with 15 cationic lipid reagents using (A) a beta-gal expression plasmid, (B) a fluorescein-tagged, phosphorothioate-modified ODN B, (C) a fluorescein-tagged, ethoxy-modified ODN C with the same nucleotide sequence as ODN B, and (D) a fluorescein-tagged, phosphorothioate-modified ODN D with a different nucleotide sequence from ODNs B and C. Cytofection was scored as percent of cells expressing beta-gal activity or showing diffuse cellular fluorescence. The best lipid reagents for the phosphorothioate-modified ODNs were ODN-specific and markedly different from the best lipid reagents for the expression plasmid or for the ethoxy-modified ODN. These results suggest that the best cationic lipid reagent for a particular cell type varies with the physical and chemical form of the DNA being transfected into the cells.","Antisense &amp; nucleic acid drug development","9826269",1998,"United States"
"Pacemaking in the heart: the interplay of ionic currents.","1. There is still a degree of controversy about which currents drive pacemaking in the sinoatrial node or sinus venous. Early attempts to identify a single 'pacemaker current' in these tissues, based on voltage-clamp data, were largely unsuccessful, prompting the search for other mechanisms that may contribute to rhythmic activity. 2. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording from single cells isolated from the sinus venosus of the toad has shown that a voltage-dependent sodium current may play a role in pacemaking. This current has a transient component that contributes to the action potential upstroke and an inactivation-resistant component that contributes to the diastolic depolarization. The relative importance of this current in pacemaking is still controversial. 3. The development of computer models of pacemaking has contributed greatly to our understanding of how ionic currents can interact to produce rhythmic activity. Results are presented from one such model, 'Oxsoft Heart', to illustrate the different contributions of Ir and INa and to highlight the concept that pacemaking is driven by the integrated activity of many processes, rather than by any one current in particular. 4. Present models of pacemaking fail to accurately reproduce biological observations for certain situations. It is becoming clear that many processes contribute to pacemaking and have yet to be fully incorporated into models. Recent results regarding the role of intracellular calcium buffering and release and their implications, are discussed in this context. 5. The control of pacemaking by neurotransmitters is discussed. The limitations of single cell models in reproducing many of the complex responses to nerve stimulation of multicellular tissue, such as postinhibitory rebound, are discussed and possible improvements to models are suggested.","Clinical and experimental pharmacology &amp; physiology","9784927",1998,"Australia"
"Design of peptidomimetics that inhibit the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor and possess cellular activity.","Phosphorylated tyrosine residues of growth factor receptors that associate with intracellular proteins containing src-homology 2 (SH2) domains are integral components in several signal transduction pathways related to proliferative diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and restenosis. In particular, a phosphorylated pentapeptide [pTyr751-Val-Pro-Met754-Leu (pTyr = phosphotyrosine)] derived from the primary sequence of platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta) receptor blocks the association of the C-terminal SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) to PDGF-beta receptor with an IC50 of 0.445 +/- 0.047 microM. Further evaluation of the structure-activity relationships for pTyr751-Val-Pro-Met-Leu resulted in the design of smaller peptidomimetics with enhanced affinity including Ac-pTyr-Val-Ala-N(C6H13)2 (IC50 = 0.076 +/- 0.010 microM). In addition, the phosphotyrosine residue was replaced with a difluorophosphonate derivative [4-phosphono(difluoromethyl)phenylalanine (CF2Pmp)] which has been shown to be stable to cellular phosphatases. The extracellular administration of either CF2Pmp-Val-Pro-Met-Leu or Ac-CF2Pmp-Val-Pro-Met-NH2 in a whole cell assay resulted in specific inhibition of the PDGF-stimulated association from the C-terminal SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to the PDGF-beta receptor in a dose-dependent manner. These compounds were also effective in inhibiting GLUT4 translocation, c-fos expression, and cell membrane ruffling in single-cell microinjection assay.","Journal of medicinal chemistry","9784108",1998,"United States"
"Inhibition of cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current by overexpression of the long-QT syndrome HERG G628S mutation in transgenic mice.","Mutations in the HERG gene are linked to the LQT2 form of the inherited long-QT syndrome. Transgenic mice were generated expressing high myocardial levels of a particularly severe form of LQT2-associated HERG mutation (G628S). Hearts from G628S mice appeared normal except for a modest enlargement seen only in females. Ventricular myocytes isolated from adult wild-type hearts consistently exhibited an inwardly rectifying E-4031-sensitive K+ current resembling the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (Ikr) in its time and voltage dependence; this current was not found in cells isolated from G628S mice. Action potential duration was significantly prolonged in single myocytes from G628S ventricle (cycle length=1 second, 26 degrees C) but not in recordings from intact ventricular strips studied at more physiological rates and temperature (200 to 400 bpm, 37 degrees C). ECG intervals, including QT duration, were unchanged, although minor aberrancies were noted in 20% (16/80) of the G628S mice studied, primarily involving the QRS complex and, more rarely, T-wave morphology. The aberrations were more commonly observed in females than males but could not be correlated with sex-based differences in action potential duration. These results establish the presence of IKr in the adult mouse ventricle and demonstrate the ability of the G628S mutation to exert a dominant negative effect on endogenous IKr in vivo, leading to the expected LQT2 phenotype of prolonged repolarization at the single cell level but not QT prolongation in the intact animal. The model may be useful in dissecting repolarization currents in the mouse heart and as a means of examining the mechanism(s) by which the G628S mutation exerts its dominant negative effect on native cardiac cells in vivo.","Circulation research","9742063",1998,"United States"
"Ethanol acutely decreases calcium transients in cultured human myotubes.","Ethanol consumption frequently leads to a number of skeletal muscle disorders, including acute and chronic alcoholic myopathy. Ethanol has been found to interfere with signal transduction mechanisms in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. We studied the effects of ethanol on the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) transients responsible for excitation-contraction coupling in human myotubes from chronic alcoholic patients and healthy controls. Cultured myotubes were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 and evaluated on a single-cell basis. Following electrical stimulation, ethanol caused a significant reversible dose-dependent reduction in [Ca2+]i transient amplitude, achieving a mean decrease of 36+/-5% at 300 mM ethanol (p &lt; 0.01), without modifying the basal [Ca2+]i. This acute effect of ethanol was similar in myotubes obtained from chronic alcoholics and controls. Similarly, ethanol caused a dose-dependent reduction of [Ca2+]i transient amplitude in control samples when depolarization was elicited by 100 mM KCl (p &lt; 0.01). Several potential mechanisms of ethanol action were studied in control muscle samples. Sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry was measured indirectly by monitoring Mn2+-quenching of intracellular fura-2 via the nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels during electrical pacing. Ethanol at doses of 100 mM and greater caused a dose-dependent reduction in the rate of quench (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the intracellular pool of Ca2+ releasable by caffeine was found to be reduced at 300 mM ethanol (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that ethanol reduces the [Ca2+]i transients underlying excitation-contraction coupling in human myotubes, and that this occurs to a similar extent in cells obtained from chronic alcoholics and controls. This acute effect of ethanol was primarily due to an inhibitory effect of ethanol on sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, although there may also be an effect on the Ca2+ sarcoplasmic reticulum loading state.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","9726279",1998,"England"
"Electrical basis of peristalsis in the mammalian upper urinary tract.","1. Peristalsis in the mammalian upper urinary tract (UUT) is mostly myogenic in origin, originating predominately in the proximal pelvicalyceal regions of the renal pelvis, an area that is enriched with specialized smooth muscle cells termed 'atypical' smooth muscle cells. Propagating peristaltic contractions are little affected by blockers of either autonomic nerve function or nerve impulse propagation; however, blockers of sensory nerve function or prostaglandin synthesis reduce both the frequency and the strength of the spontaneous contractions underlying peristalsis. 2. The electrical drive for these peristaltic contractions has long been considered to involve mechanisms analogous to the heart, such that 'atypical' smooth muscle cells generate spontaneous 'pacemaker' action potentials. These pacemaker potentials trigger the firing of action potentials and contraction in the muscular regions of the renal pelvis, which propagate distally to the ureter, propelling urine towards the bladder. 3. Recent intracellular microelectrode and single cell/channel patch-clamp studies have revealed that the ionic conductances underlying the action potentials recorded in the UUT are likely to involve the opening and slow closure of voltage-activated 'L-type' Ca2+ channels, offset by the time-dependent opening and closure of both voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. 4. In the present review we summarize the current knowledge of the ionic mechanisms underlying action potential discharge in the UUT, as well as present our view on how this electrical activity supports the initiation and conduction of UUT peristalsis.","Clinical and experimental pharmacology &amp; physiology","9612657",1998,"Australia"
"Contractile activity is required for sarcomeric assembly in phenylephrine-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.","Agonist-induced hypertrophy of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) has been attributed to biochemical signals generated during receptor activation. However, NRVM hypertrophy can also be induced by spontaneous or electrically stimulated contractile activity in the absence of exogenous neurohormonal stimuli. Using single-cell imaging of fura 2-loaded myocytes, we found that low-density, noncontracting NRVM begin to generate intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients and contractile activity within minutes of exposure to the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE; 50 microM). However, NRVM pretreated with verapamil and then stimulated with PE failed to elicit [Ca2+]i transients and beating. We therefore examined whether PE-induced [Ca2+]i transients and contractile activity were required to elicit specific aspects of the hypertrophic phenotype. PE treatment (48-72 h) increased cell size, total protein content, total protein-to-DNA ratio, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoenzyme content. PE also stimulated sarcomeric protein assembly and prolonged MHC half-life. However, blockade of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels with verapamil, diltiazem, or nifedipine (10 microM) blocked PE-induced total protein and MHC accumulation and prevented the time-dependent assembly of myofibrillar proteins into sarcomeres. Inhibition of actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling with 2,3-butanedione monoxime (7.5 mM) also prevented PE-induced total protein and MHC accumulation, indicating that mechanical activity, rather than [Ca2+]i transients per se, was required. In contrast, blockade of [Ca2+]i transients and contractile activity did not prevent the PE-induced increase in cell surface area, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, or upregulation of atrial natriuretic factor gene expression. Thus contractile activity is required to elicit some but not all aspects of the the hypertrophic phenotype induced by alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation.","The American journal of physiology","9612209",1998,"United States"
"Cardiac and extracardiac expression of Csx/Nkx2.5 homeodomain protein.","Csx/Nkx2.5 is an evolutionary conserved homeobox gene related to the Drosophila tinman gene, which is essential for the dorsal mesoderm formation. Expression of Csx/Nkx2.5 mRNA is the earliest marker for heart precursor cells in all vertebrates so far examined. Previous studies have demonstrated that Csx/Nkx2.5 mRNA is highly expressed in the heart and at lower levels in the spleen, tongue, stomach, and thyroid in the murine embryo. Since some developmental genes are regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms, we analyzed the developmental pattern of Csx protein expression at the single-cell level using Csx-specific antibodies. Immunohistochemical analysis of murine embryos at 7.8 days post coitum revealed that Csx protein is strongly expressed in the nucleus of endodermal and mesodermal cells in the cardiogenic plate. Subsequently, in the heart, Csx protein was detected only in the nucleus of myocytes of the atrium and the ventricle through the adult stage. During the fetal period, Csx protein expression in the nucleus was also noted in the spleen, stomach, liver, tongue, and anterior larynx. Unexpectedly, confocal microscopy revealed that Csx immunoreactivity was detected only in the cytoplasm of a subset of cranial skeletal muscles. Csx protein was not detected in the thyroid glands. The expression of Csx protein in all organs was markedly downregulated after birth except in the heart. These results raise the possibility that Csx/Nkx2.5 may play a role in the early developmental process of multiple tissues in addition to its role in early heart development.","Circulation research","9598591",1998,"United States"
"Cardiac arrest in rodents: maximal duration compatible with a recovery of neuronal activity.","We report here that during a permanent cardiac arrest, rodent brain tissue is &quot;physiologically&quot; preserved in situ in a particular quiescent state. This state is characterized by the absence of electrical activity and by a critical period of 5-6 hr during which brain tissue can be reactivated upon restoration of a simple energy (glucose/oxygen) supply. In rat brain slices prepared 1-6 hr after cardiac arrest and maintained in vitro for several hours, cells with normal morphological features, intrinsic membrane properties, and spontaneous synaptic activity were recorded from various brain regions. In addition to functional membrane channels, these neurons expressed mRNA, as revealed by single-cell reverse transcription-PCR, and could synthesize proteins de novo. Slices prepared after longer delays did not recover. In a guinea pig isolated whole-brain preparation that was cannulated and perfused with oxygenated saline 1-2 hr after cardiac arrest, cell activity and functional long-range synaptic connections could be restored although the electroencephalogram remained isoelectric. Perfusion of the isolated brain with the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor antagonist picrotoxin, however, could induce self-sustained temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, in rodents, the duration of cardiac arrest compatible with a short-term recovery of neuronal activity is much longer than previously expected. The analysis of the parameters that regulate this duration may bring new insights into the prevention of postischemic damages.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","9539810",1998,"United States"
"Augmentation of dendritic cells in murine organ donors by Flt3 ligand alters the balance between transplant tolerance and immunity.","Treatment of mice with the recently cloned hemopoietic growth factor Flt3 ligand (FL; 10 microg/day for 10 days) resulted in a large increase in myeloid lineage cells within the liver. While the number of nonparenchymal cells (NPC) harvested from liver increased about 9-fold, a 90-fold increase was observed in the proportion of CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) recovered from NPC following overnight (18-h) culture in granulocyte-macrophage CSF. In contrast, only a 50% increase was seen in CD11c+ cells within heart single cell suspensions and in the number of DC obtained from hearts after 18-h culture. Liver NPC and heart cell suspensions freshly isolated from 10-day FL-treated animals exhibited increased T cell allostimulatory capacity compared with controls. Overnight cultured DC from livers of FL-treated animals expressed both higher levels of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) and allostimulatory activity than those from controls. Heart-derived DC also displayed enhanced stimulatory capacity. Pretreatment of organ donors with FL for either 5 or 10 days before transplant of organs to normal recipients abrogated the spontaneous liver allograft acceptance normally observed and resulted in delayed or acute graft rejection (median survival times, 40 and 12 days, respectively). Heart rejection was significantly accelerated by pretreatment of donors with FL for 5 or 10 days (median survival times, 8 and 7 days, respectively, vs 12 days in controls). These novel findings reveal the potent immunologic adjuvant properties of FL in vivo. They also show that substantial augmentation of the number of potential allostimulatory cells in donor organs before transplantation favors rejection rather than tolerance induction.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","9548488",1998,"United States"
"Mechanism of anode break stimulation in the heart.","Anodal stimulation is routinely observed in cardiac tissue, but only recently has a mechanism been proposed. The bidomain cardiac tissue model proposes that virtual cathodes induced at sites distant from the electrode initiate the depolarization. In contrast, none of the existing cardiac action potential models (Luo-Rudy phase I and II, or Oxsoft) predict anodal stimulation at the single-cell level. To determine whether anodal stimulation has a cellular basis, we measured membrane potential and membrane current in mammalian ventricular myocytes by using whole-cell patch clamp. Anode break responses can be readily elicited in single ventricular cells. The basis of this anodal stimulation in single cells is recruitment of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current I(f). The threshold of activation for I(f) is -80 mV in rat cells and -120 mV in guinea pig or canine cells. Persistent I(f) &quot;tail&quot; current upon release of the hyperpolarization drives the transmembrane potential toward the threshold of sodium channels, initiating an action potential. Time-dependent block of the inward rectifier, I(K1), at hyperpolarized potentials decreases membrane conductance and thereby potentiates the ability of I(f) to depolarize the cell on the break of an anodal pulse. Inclusion of I(f), as well as the block and unblock kinetics of I(K1), in the existing Luo-Rudy action potential model faithfully reproduces anode break stimulation. Thus active cellular properties suffice to explain anode break stimulation in cardiac tissue.","Biophysical journal","9545047",1998,"United States"
"Single-cell measurements of purine release using a micromachined electroanalytical sensor.","To study the cellular events surrounding the formation of purines in cardiac ischemia, we have micromachined a micrometer-scale titer chamber containing an integrated electrochemical sensor, capable of measuring analytes produced by a single heart cell. The analytical procedure involves the determination of metabolites via the amperometric detection of enzymically generated hydrogen peroxide, measured at a platinized microelectrode, poised at a suitably oxidizing potential, equivalent to +420 mV vs Ag/AgCl. Signals were recorded as current-time responses and were integrated to give a total charge (Q) attributable to the reaction under investigation. The amount of analyte produced by the cell was subsequently quantified by the addition of a known amount of calibrant. As a consequence, by using a cascade of three enzymes (adenosine deaminase, nucleotide phosphorylase, and xanthine oxidase), we were able to show that, after rigor contracture had been induced in a single myocyte, adenosine (but not inosine) only reached the extracellular space after the cell membrane had been permeabilized by detergent. These data, which could only be obtained unambiguously by using this single-cell methodology, have provided us with information on the origin of ischemic adenosine which challenges the established assumption that purine release is an early retaliatory response from intact anoxic myocytes.","Analytical chemistry","9530006",1998,"United Kingdom"
"Direct mass spectrometric peptide profiling and sequencing of single neurons reveals differential peptide patterns in a small neuronal network.","Mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to detect and structurally characterize peptides in two functionally related neurons, named VD1 and RPD2, which form a network involved in the modulation of heartbeat in Lymnaea. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS, directly applied to single neurons VD1 and RPD2, showed overlapping yet distinct mass profiles, with a subset of putative peptides specifically present in neuron VD1. Direct tandem MS of a single VD1 neuron revealed the primary structures of the VD1-specific peptides, which were identified as members of the family of small cardioactive peptides. Based on the tandem MS data, a degenerate oligonucleotide was made for use in a polymerase chain reaction strategy to isolate the cDNA encoding the precursor to the small cardioactive peptides from a brain-specific cDNA library. The calculated masses of the mature, posttranslationally modified peptides, as predicted from the corresponding cDNA, agreed with the measured masses of the actual peptides, as detected in single-cell MS analysis. In situ hybridization studies showed that the transcript encoding the precursor is present in VD1, but not in RPD2, thus corroborating the single-cell MS analysis. Finally, the small cardioactive peptides were shown to enhance the contractions of the auricle in vitro.","Biochemistry","9485334",1998,"United States"
"Adenosine prevents K+-induced Ca2+ loading: insight into cardioprotection during cardioplegia.","In clinical practice, hyperkalemic cardioplegia induces sarcolemmic depolarization, and therefore is used to arrest the heart during open heart operations. However, the elevated concentration of K+ that is present in cardioplegic solutions promotes intracellular Ca2+ loading, which could aggravate ventricular dysfunction after cardiac operations. This review highlights recent findings that have established, at the single cell level, the protective action of adenosine against hyperkalemia-induced Ca2+ loading. When it was added to hyperkalemic cardioplegic solutions, adenosine, at millimolar concentrations and through a direct action on ventricular cardiomyocytes, prevented K+-induced Ca2+ loading. This action of adenosine required the activation of protein kinase C, and it was effective only in cardiomyocytes with low diastolic Ca2+ levels. Of importance, adenosine did not diminish the magnitude of K+-induced membrane depolarization, allowing unimpeded cardiac arrest. Taken together, these findings provide direct support for the idea that adenosine is valuable when used as an adjunct to hyperkalemic cardioplegia. This idea has emerged from previous clinical studies that have shown improvement of the clinical outcome after cardiac operations when adenosine or related substances were used to supplement cardioplegic solutions. Further studies are required to define more precisely the mechanism of action of adenosine, and the conditions that may determine the efficacy of adenosine as a cytoprotective supplement to cardioplegia.","The Annals of thoracic surgery","9485282",1998,"Netherlands"
"Ca2+ waves during triggered propagated contractions in intact trabeculae.","Triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) starting from damaged regions travel along multicellular cardiac muscle preparations. We have reported that octanol (100 microM) inhibits TPCs. The inhibitory effect of octanol on propagation of TPCs could be due to an effect of octanol on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mediated by Ca2+ diffusion inside the single cell or on the diffusion of Ca2+ from cell to cell via gap junctions (GJs). Therefore, we studied the regional changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) during TPCs and the effect of octanol on the permeability of gap junctions (PGJ) in rat cardiac trabeculae. [Ca2+]i was measured using electrophoretically injected fura 2 and an image-intensified charge-coupled device camera. PGJ was calculated from the diffusion coefficient for fura 2 in trabeculae (Dtrab) and in the myoplasm (Dmyop). After 1- and 3-h superfusion with 100 microM 1-octanol, Dmyop showed no significant changes, whereas Dtrab was reduced significantly. Therefore, calculated PGJ was reduced from 4.15 x 10(-5) to 2.10 x 10(-5) and 0.86 x 10(-5) cm/s, respectively. The propagation velocity of the regional increases in [Ca2+]i during TPCs was constant, averaging 1.69 +/- 1.48 mm/s (range 0.34-5.47 mm/s, n = 10). These observations support the hypothesis that TPCs are initiated near the damaged ends of trabeculae and are propagated by CICR from the sarcoplasmic reticulum mediated by diffusion of Ca2+ through cells and from cell to cell through GJs.","The American journal of physiology","9458876",1998,"United States"
"Nitric oxide regulation of atrioventricular node excitability.","The role of nitric oxide in the autonomical regulation of atrioventricular (AV) spontaneous action potentials and L-type calcium current (ICa-L) in isolated single AV nodal cells from rabbit heart was examined by using the whole cell patch clamp technique, immunohistochemical staining and single cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. The nitric oxide donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) (0.1 mmol/L) suppressed the beta-agonist isoproterenol- (1 mumol/L) stimulated increase in ICa-L and decreased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous action potentials. In cells in which ICa-L had been previously attenuated by the muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine (CCh, 1 mumol/L), SIN-1 had no additive effect. Intracellular dialysis with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 0.5 mmol/L) blocked CCh- but not SIN-1-induced ICa-L attenuation. However, intracellular dialysis with methylene blue (20 mumol/L), which inhibits nitric oxide-mediated activation of guanylyl cyclase and cGMP production blocked the effects of both CCh and SIN-1 on ICa-L. In these cells, neither L-NMMA nor methylene blue affected the CCh-activated potassium current (IK(ACh)). Internal dialysis with cGMP (10 mumol/L) significantly inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated ICa-L without affecting IK(ACh). In AV nodal cells internally perfused with either a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP (0.5 mmol/L), or a high concentration of cAMP (0.5 mmol/L), CCh did not inhibit ICa-L but still activated IK(ACh). CCh-induced ICa-L attenuation could be abolished or quickly reversed by the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (20 mumol/L) but not by milrinone (5 mumol/L), which only inhibits the cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase isozyme (PDE3). Immunohistochemical staining identified the presence of the endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) in both single AV node cells in vitro and in cryostat sections of AV node tissue in situ. These results demonstrate that endogenous nitric oxide is involved in the muscarinic cholinergic attenuation of ICa-L in AV nodal cells; the mechanism likely involves the cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase.","The Canadian journal of cardiology","9444302",1998,"United States"
"A rapidly activating sustained K+ current modulates repolarization and excitation-contraction coupling in adult mouse ventricle.","1. The K+ currents which control repolarization in adult mouse ventricle, and the effects of changes in action potential duration on excitation-contraction coupling in this tissue, have been studied with electrophysiological methods using single cell preparations and by recording mechanical parameters from an in vitro working heart preparation. 2. Under conditions where Ca(2+)-dependent currents were eliminated by buffering intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA, depolarizing voltage steps elicited two rapidly activating outward K+ currents: (i) a transient outward current, and (ii) a slowly inactivating or 'sustained' delayed rectifier. 3. These two currents were separated pharmacologically by the K+ channel blocker 4-amino-pyridine (4-AP). 4-AP at concentrations between 3 and 200 microM resulted in (i) a marked increase in action potential duration and a large decrease in the sustained K+ current at plateau potentials, as well as (ii) a significant increase in left ventricular systolic pressure in the working heart preparation. 4. The current-voltage (I-V) relation, kinetics, and block by low concentrations of 4-AP strongly suggest that the rapid delayed rectifier in adult mouse ventricles is the same K+ current (Kv1.5) that has been characterized in detail in human and canine atria. 5. These results show that the 4-AP-sensitive rapid delayed rectifier is a very important repolarizing current in mouse ventricle. The enhanced contractility produced by 4-AP (50 microM) in the working heart preparation demonstrates that modulation of the action potential duration, by blocking a K+ current, is a very significant inotropic variable.","The Journal of physiology","9401964",1997,"England"
"The role of spatial interactions in creating the dispersion of transmembrane potential by premature electric shocks.","Strong electric shocks applied during the refractory period can initiate or terminate cardiac arrhythmias. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, Knisley et al. used rabbit papillary muscle in vitro to scan the refractory period of an action potential with shocks of different strengths. The resulting map of the shock-induced changes in the transmembrane potential (Vm) illustrates the substrate for the creation of rotors. Our study uses computer simulations to reproduce this experimental map. Three models (a space-clamped membrane, a single cell, and a one-dimensional fiber) were used to determine whether the observed map was caused by (i) the intrinsic dynamics of the membrane, (ii) the simultaneous depolarization and hyperpolarization of the opposite ends of each cell, or (iii) spatial interactions involving the whole muscle strand. The results show that the membrane and single cell models cannot reproduce the experimental map. The fiber model reproduces the shock-induced changes in Vm and demonstrates that they are caused by a propagating disturbance, which, depending on the coupling interval and the shock strength, can be a new action potential or an electrotonus and can arrive from the depolarized end or from both depolarized and hyperpolarized ends of the fiber. These results indicate that the induction of rotors in the heart may not be a direct effect of the electric field.","Annals of biomedical engineering","9395041",1997,"United States"
"Spatiotemporal complexity of ventricular fibrillation revealed by tissue mass reduction in isolated swine right ventricle. Further evidence for the quasiperiodic route to chaos hypothesis.","We have presented evidence that ventricular fibrillation is deterministic chaos arising from quasiperiodicity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the transition from chaos (ventricular fibrillation, VF) to periodicity (ventricular tachycardia) through quasiperiodicity could be produced by the progressive reduction of tissue mass. In isolated and perfused swine right ventricular free wall, recording of single cell transmembrane potentials and simultaneous mapping (477 bipolar electrodes, 1.6 mm resolution) were performed. The tissue mass was then progressively reduced by sequential cutting. All isolated tissues fibrillated spontaneously. The critical mass to sustain VF was 19.9 +/- 4.2 g. As tissue mass was decreased, the number of wave fronts decreased, the life-span of reentrant wave fronts increased, and the cycle length, the diastolic interval, and the duration of action potential lengthened. There was a parallel decrease in the dynamical complexity of VF as measured by Kolmogorov entropy and Poincar¨¦ plots. A period of quasiperiodicity became more evident before the conversion from VF (chaos) to a more regular arrhythmia (periodicity). In conclusion, a decrease in the number of wave fronts in ventricular fibrillation by tissue mass reduction causes a transition from chaotic to periodic dynamics via the quasiperiodic route.","The Journal of clinical investigation","9366563",1997,"United States"
"Time scale dependent viscoelastic and contractile regimes in fibroblasts probed by microplate manipulation.","Many essential phenomena in biology involve changes in cell shape. Cell deformation occurs in response to physical forces either coming from the external environment or intracellularly generated. In most tests of cell rheology, an external constraint is usually superimposed on an already mechanically active cell, thus the measurements may reflect both active motion and passive viscoelastic deformation. To show that active and passive processes could be distinguished on a time scale basis, we designed a novel piezo-controlled micromanipulation system to impose dynamic mechanical deformations on individual cells. Chick fibroblasts were seized between two glass microplates; one of the plates, more flexible, served as a sensor of the applied force. Controlled amounts of unidirectional compression and traction in the range of 10(-8)-10(-7) N were applied, using either step functions or sinusoidal signals at chosen frequencies. These tests allowed identification of three time scale dependent regimes. (1) A dominant elastic response, characterized by a linear stress-strain relationship, was especially apparent at short times (seconds); (2) A viscous behavior, characterized by force relaxation and irreversible cell deformation, was noticeable at intermediate times (minutes). Data from traction and oscillatory excitation tests were well fitted by a three-element Kelvin viscoelastic model, allowing the calculation of two elastic moduli in the range of 600-1,000 N/m2 and an apparent viscosity of about 10(4) Pa.s. (3) A contractile regime, in which actin-dependent traction forces were developed in response to uniaxial load was apparent at longer times (several tens of minutes). These forces were in the order of 4 x 10(-8) N above viscous relaxation. Thus we could distinguish, on a time scale basis, the specific contributions of passive viscoelasticity and active traction, and evaluate their mechanical characteristics within one experiment on a single cell.","Journal of cell science","9378761",1997,"England"
"Simulations of postvagal tachycardia at the single cell pacemaker level: a new hypothesis.","Simulations performed on a single cell model of rabbit sinoatrial node activity after prolonged vagal stimulation have been able to reproduce the known characteristics of cycle length recovery, including the presence of rapid and slow recovery phases and the transient undershoot phenomenon known as postvagal tachycardia (PVT). In the model, the PVT component has been hypothesized to result from the recovery of background levels of the muscarinic K+ current iK,ACh from desensitization due to prolonged exposure to acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter. Other components of the recovery were found to be due to the inactivation of iK,ACh after the hydrolysis of ACh (rapid phase) and the recovery of the hyperpolarizing-activated current i(f) from its ACh-induced inhibition (slow phase). The magnitudes of both the rapid component and the PVT were found to increase linearly with preceding vagally mediated increase in cycle length, whereas the gain of the slow component was found to saturate, reflecting the limited contribution of i(f) inhibition to cycle prolongation.","Annals of biomedical engineering","9300101",1997,"United States"
"Tissue-specific heterogeneity in alpha-dystroglycan sialoglycosylation. Skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan is a latent receptor for Vicia villosa agglutinin b4 masked by sialic acid modification.","Because the polypeptide core of alpha-dystroglycan is encoded by a single gene, the difference in apparent molecular mass between alpha-dystroglycans expressed in various tissues is presumably due to differential glycosylation. However, little is presently known about the tissue-specific differences in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and whether these modifications may confer functional variability to alpha-dystroglycan. We recently observed that laminin-1 binding to skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan was dramatically inhibited by heparin, whereas the binding of commercial merosin to skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan was only marginally inhibited (Pall, E. A., Bolton, K. M., and Ervasti, J. M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 3817-3821). In contrast to 156-kDa skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan, both laminin-1 and merosin binding to 120-kDa brain alpha-dystroglycan were sensitive to heparin. We have now examined the laminin binding properties of 140-kDa alpha-dystroglycan purified from cardiac muscle and observed that like skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan, heparin inhibited cardiac alpha-dystroglycan binding to laminin-1, but not to merosin. On the other hand, cardiac and brain alpha-dystroglycans could be distinguished from skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan by their reactivity with the terminal GalNAc-specific lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin. Interestingly, skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan became reactive with V. villosa agglutinin upon digestion with sialidase from Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter neurofaciens, or Streptococcus, but not Vibrio cholerae or Newcastle disease virus sialidase. While none of the sialidase treatments affected the laminin binding properties of alpha-dystroglycan, the sum of our results suggests that skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan contains a novel sialic acid residue linked alpha2-6 to GalNAc. These properties are also consistent with the cellular characteristics of a GalNAc-terminated glycoconjugate recently implicated in neuromuscular synaptogenesis. Thus, variations in alpha-dystroglycan sialoglycosylation may prove as useful markers to further elucidate the role of alpha-dystroglycan glycoforms in different tissues and perhaps within a single cell type.","The Journal of biological chemistry","9268382",1997,"United States"
"Transgenic human decay accelerating factor makes normal pigs function as a concordant species.","BACKGROUND: Increasing interest has focused on xenotransplantation as a potential solution to the organ shortage. To overcome hyperacute rejection, pigs have been produced that are transgenic for human decay accelerating factor (DAF). For the evaluation of the effects of human DAF, an ex vivo working heart model was used.METHODS: We compared hemodynamic performance of four transgenic pig hearts (group A) with that of four Landrace pig hearts (group B) and eight rhesus monkey hearts (group C). For perfusion fresh blood had been taken from healthy volunteers. From the coronary sinus effluent, samples were taken for the determination of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, prostaglandin E2, creatine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters were measured continuously for 150 minutes after the start. After 15 minutes of reperfusion, the Langendorff-mode was switched to the working heart model. After hearts failed to pump against the afterload column, experiments were terminated, and tissue sections were taken for electron microscopy.RESULTS: Groups A and C showed superior cardiac performance as measured by stroke work index (SWI) that exceeded group B by 2.5 to 3 times (p &lt; 0.05). In all three groups the SWI slowly decreased during perfusion. In group B, SWI decreased to a minimum as early as 90 minutes after the start. In all groups, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2 as indicators of endothelial cell activation increased. In group B, however, the levels exceeded those of groups A and C by six and nine times, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). As markers of myocardial damage, creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase increased in all groups. But again levels in group B exceeded those of groups A and C by four to five times (p &lt; 0.05). Electron microscopy revealed single cell necrosis in group B, whereas groups A and C showed interstitial edema only.CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments indicate a crucial role of DAF in preventing rejection in discordant species combinations. Transgenic human DAF seems to inhibit successfully complement-mediated damage to the endothelial cell, thus preventing endothelial activation and consequently myocardial damage. Transgenic human DAF makes a discordant species (pig) function as a concordant species, that is, hyperacute rejection does not occur.","The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation","9257258",1997,"United States"
"Morphological and biochemical characterization and analysis of apoptosis.","Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death serving physiologic and homeostatic functions. However, recent evidence implicating apoptosis in the etiology and pathophysiology of known human diseases, such as heart diseases, cancer, AIDS, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases are continually surfacing. This has spawned the need for identifying which methods are the most effective and well accepted to decipher its presence in a variety of research settings. We have therefore detailed the morphology and biochemical features of apoptotic cell death, with an emphasis on discriminating it from necrosis. In addition, we describe specific and selective techniques which are optimal to target hallmark apoptotic features, such as microscopy, Annexin V labeling, in situ nick-end labeling (TUNEL), and DNA fragmentation analysis by gel electrophoresis and ELISA for oligonucleosome-sized DNA. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed, as well as their experimental importance relative to one another. The methods have been described in a stepwise fashion, and can readily be applied in the majority of cell systems. Whether working on the tissue or single cell level, these methods are highly effective in qualifying and quantifying apoptosis. The application of these methods in conjunction with molecular techniques can further delineate the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis.","Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods","9279777",1997,"United States"
"Physiological assessment of complex cardiac phenotypes in genetically engineered mice.","The recent development of techniques for surgical manipulation and for the assessment of cardiac physiology in genetically engineered mice has allowed scientists to address some of the most fundamental questions related to congenital and acquired forms of human heart disease. This review discusses recent advances in the techniques for studying cardiac disease using the mouse as a model system. Because cardiac overload is one of the most important stimuli for development of hypertrophy and heart failure in humans, various models of cardiac pressure and volume overload, as well as myocardial ischemia, have been developed and characterized. Moreover, it is possible to reliably examine murine cardiac physiology in vivo with microtransducers, echocardiography, and other miniaturized techniques. Sophisticated methods have also been developed to enable an examination of single-cell phenotypes of isolated cardiomyocytes derived from genetically engineered mice. These physiological assessments, coupled with conventional histology and molecular markers, have allowed the characterization of several gene-targeted and transgenic mouse models of hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as mouse models of cardiac developmental defects. Such mouse models of heart disease will ultimately allow the molecular dissection of the interplay between the various factors leading to heart disease, and they may serve as a guide to appropriate therapeutic strategies for human heart disease.","The American journal of physiology","9227526",1997,"United States"
"Tension response of the cardiotonic agent (+)-EMD-57033 at the single cell level.","The effects of the Ca sensitizer (+)-EMD-57033 were tested on single chemically skinned cells isolated from rat ventricle. The present study demonstrates that (+)-EMD-57033 (10 microM) increased maximal force by 20% (at pCa 4.5) and myofilament Ca sensitivity by 0.2 pCa unit. However, the force-length dependency was not affected by the addition of (+)-EMD-57033, since similar Ca-sensitizing effects occurred at different sarcomere lengths. Consequently, the Ca-sensitizing effect of the drug and of the sarcomere length might be additive. Cross-bridge kinetics were also investigated in the presence of the thiadiazinone derivative. (+)-EMD-57033 induced marked increases in the rate of tension redevelopment (ktr) after brief slack release/restretch, particularly at low Ca concentrations. These results suggest that the Ca-sensitizing effects of (+)-EMD-57033 are due, at least in part, to an increased number of attached cross bridges during one cyclo. This observation, together with the increase in peak force, is discussed in relation to the reduction in energy cost induced by such Ca-sensitizing agents.","The American journal of physiology","9176150",1997,"United States"
"Skeletal muscle-specific myosin binding protein-H is expressed in Purkinje fibers of the cardiac conduction system.","Heart contraction is coordinated by conduction of electrical excitation through specialized tissues of the cardiac conduction system. By retroviral single-cell tagging and lineage analyses in the embryonic chicken heart, we have recently demonstrated that a subset of cardiac muscle cells terminally differentiates as cells of the peripheral conduction system (Purkinje fibers) and that this occurs invariably in perivascular regions of developing coronary arteries. Cis regulatory elements that function in transcriptional regulation of cells in the conducting system have been distinguished from those in contractile cardiac muscle cells; eg, 5' regulatory sequences of the desmin gene act as enhancer elements in skeletal muscle and in the conduction system but not in cardiac muscle. We hypothesize that Purkinje fiber differentiation involves a switch of the gene expression program from that characteristic of cardiac muscle to one typical of skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of myosin binding protein-H (MyBP-H) in Purkinje fibers of chicken hearts. This unique myosin binding protein is present in skeletal but not cardiac myocytes. A site-directed polyclonal antibody (AB105) was generated against MyBP-H. Immunohistological analysis of the myocardium mapped the AB105 antigen predominantly to A bands of myofibrils within Purkinje fibers. Western blot analysis of whole extracts from the ventricular wall of adult chicken hearts revealed that the AB105 epitope was restricted to a single protein of approximately 86 kD, the same size as MyBP-H in skeletal muscle. Biochemical properties of the Purkinje fiber 86-kD protein and RNase protection analyses of its mRNA indicate that Purkinje fiber 86-kD protein is indistinguishable from skeletal muscle MyBP-H. The results provide evidence that skeletal muscle MyBP-H is expressed in a subset of cardiac muscle cells that differentiate into Purkinje fibers of the heart.","Circulation research","9130447",1997,"United States"
"Reduced ischemia and reperfusion injury following exercise training.","We examined the effects of two exercise training modalities, i.e., low-intensity endurance and sprint running, on in vitro, isovolumic myocardial performance following ischemia and reperfusion. Rats ran on a treadmill 5 d.wk-1 for 6 wk at the following levels: endurance; 20 m.min-1, 0% grade, 60 min.d-1 and sprint; five 1-min runs at 75 m.min-1, 15% grade interspersed with 1-min active recovery runs at 20 m.min-1, 15% grade. Both endurance and sprint training significantly improved exercise tolerance relative to control (P &lt; 0.05) on two graded exercise tests. Buffer perfused hearts of control (N = 18), endurance (N = 20), and sprint (N = 13) trained animals underwent no-flow ischemia (20 min) and reperfusion (30 min) in a Langendorff mode. During reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure and its first derivative were 20% higher in sprint (P &lt; 0.05) than either endurance or control hearts. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was lowest in sprint during reperfusion (sprint, 10 +/- 1 mm Hg vs endurance, 14 +/- 2 mm Hg; and control, 14 +/- 2 mm Hg, at 30 min reperfusion). Hearts were then used for biochemical studies or dissociated into single cells for measurement of contraction, cell calcium, and action potential duration. Single cell contractions were greatest in sprint despite similar calcium transients in all groups. Ischemia/reperfusion caused action potential prolongation in control but not trained myocytes. Hearts from sprint had the greatest glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (P &lt; 0.05) and a tendency towards increased superoxide dismutase activity. These results suggest that sprinting increases myocardial resistance to ischemia/reperfusion. This protection may be secondary to increased myofilament calcium sensitivity and/or myocardial expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.","Medicine and science in sports and exercise","9107634",1997,"United States"
"Altered ionic calcium and cell motion in ventricular myocytes after cutaneous thermal injury.","Cutaneous thermal injury resulting in burns covering approximately 45% of the total body surface area initiates metabolic alterations which contribute to subsequent myocardial dysfunction. Alterations in calcium homeostasis have been proposed as one mechanism by which burn injury alters organ function. This study used fura-2 and time-resolved single cell fluorescence microscopy to examine stress-related alterations in intracellular calcium in isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from rats given a full-thickness scald burn comprising 43% of the total body surface area and fluid resuscitated with lactated Ringer's by the Parkland formula; control animals were included for comparison. Burn trauma caused a significant increase in cardiac myocyte maximal (peak systolic) and minimal (diastolic) mean cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) transient ratios when compared to [Ca2+]i transient ratios measured in control rats. Isoproterenol application altered the time course of the [Ca2+]i transients of normal myocytes but this response was not observed in myocytes from the thermally injured rats. In addition, isoproterenol application to normal myocytes produced a significant increase in the amplitude of cell edge motion (+50%) compared to the cell edge motion measured in myocytes without isoproterenol stimulation; however, this cell motion response did not occur after isoproterenol application to myocytes from thermally injured rats. Caffeine application increased the maximal and minimal [Ca2+]i transient ratios of all myocytes, regardless of a burn injury, and the time course of the [Ca2+]i transients from the two groups appeared similar in the presence of caffeine as the myocytes progressed to contracture. Our data suggest that burn-mediated alterations in calcium homeostasis contribute, in part, to the cardiac contractile dysfunction which occurs after burn injury.","The Journal of surgical research","9184671",1997,"United States"
"Characterization of single-unit activity in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus during expression of differential heart rate conditioning in the rabbit.","Much recent evidence has shown that the thalamic-prefrontal axis is involved in Pavlovian conditioning in rabbits. However, while single cell activity in the prefrontal cortex has been previously studied during classical conditioning in rabbits, that of its thalamic projection nucleus, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, has not. Consequently, in the present research we recorded neuronal activity from individual cells in MD during expression of conditioned bradycardia in rabbits that received differential Pavlovian conditioning in which tones served as conditioned stimuli and periorbital shock served as unconditioned stimuli. The pattern of firing in MD was similar to that evoked in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Of 84 cells sampled, approximately 35% showed CS-evoked activity. Ninety percent of these cells showed increases in activity, while the remainder were biphasic, showing an initial increase followed by a decrease. Also, like the mPFC, some cells showed initial increases, which declined during CS presentation, while others showed gradual increases which reached their maximum at CS offset. Also some cells were responsive to the CS+ and others to the CS-. Thus, MD cells, like mPFC cells, are somewhat heterogenous with regard to responding to conditional stimuli, although, unlike the mPFC, no strictly inhibitory cells were found.","Neurobiology of learning and memory","9075241",1997,"United States"
"The cardiac vulnerable period and reentrant arrhythmias: targets of anti- and proarrhythmic processes.","Because sudden cardiac death is usually preceded by a reentrant arrhythmia, the precipitating arrhythmia must be multicellular in origin. Therefore clinicians seeking to reduce the incidence of reentrant arrhythmias in their patients with antiarrhythmic drugs that alter propagation may reasonably question the applicability of drug classification schemes (e.g. Sicilian Gambit) that are based on measurements in single cells. This raises a major question: are measures of a drug's anti- and proarrhythmic potential in single cells predictive of its anti- and proarrhythmic properties in tissue? The problem is as follows. From single cell measurements, one expects Class I drugs to reduce excitability, thereby attenuating the occurrence of PVCs. Similarly, one expects Class III drugs to prolong refractoriness and reduce the occurrence of PVCs. We have found in simple models of cardiac tissue that sodium channel blockade (the target of Class I drugs) extends the vulnerable period of a propagating excitation wave, whereas potassium channel blockade (the target of Class III drugs) destabilizes the reentrant path in a manner that amplifies the likelihood of polymorphic tachyarrhythmias. Using analytical, numerical, and experimental studies, we determined that sodium channel blockade was proarrhythmic. In fact, we found that any intervention that slowed conduction was proarrhythmic because slowed conduction increases the vulnerable period and reduces the spatial requirements for sustained reentry. We also found that when obstacles were placed in the path of a propagating wave, reentry occurred when the conduction velocity was less than a critical value. Once reentry was established, we observed that the ECG displayed monomorphic QRS complexes when the reentrant path did not vary from cycle to cycle. Moreover, when the reentry path did vary from cycle to cycle, the ECG displayed polymorphic QRS complexes. The cycle-to-cycle variation in QRS morphology was caused by the spatial variability of the reentry path. The variability of reentry paths (and hence the degree of polymorphic variation in QRS complexes) was amplified by Class III agents. The results presented here show that multicellular proarrhythmic effects are derived from the same mechanisms that exhibit antiarrhythmic properties in single cells.","Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE","9058848",1997,"United States"
"Selectivity of felodipine for depolarized ventricular myocytes: a study at the single-cell level.","We studied the effects of felodipine (a second-generation dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker) on excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling) in single isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, using the whole-cell perforated patch-clamp technique or the Ca indicator, indo-1. Felodipine inhibited both L-type Ca2+ channel currents (ICa) and cell contractions in a concentration-dependent manner (10 pM to 100 nM) when we used a holding potential of -80 mV or -40 mV. The potency of felodipine was sharply dependent on a holding potential. Namely, use of a more depolarized holding potential markedly increased the potency of felodipine for inhibition of ICa and cell contraction. Next we current-clamped cells and obtained the resting membrane potential of -82 +/- 8 mV. When cells were current-injected at 0.1 Hz, exposure to 10 nM felodipine slightly but significantly diminished the amplitude of cell contractions (7.2 +/- 1.6 to 6.7 +/- 1.7 microns, P &lt; 0.05) within 10 min. When cells were field stimulated, exposure of cells to 10 nM felodipine also slightly diminished the amplitude of cell shortening (5.1 +/- 2.0 to 4.6 +/- 1.9 microns, P &lt; 0.05) and [Ca2+]i transients. We observed clear voltage-dependent blockade of E-C coupling by felodipine in ventricular myocytes. Thus, therapeutic concentrations (1-10 nM) of felodipine could inhibit E-C coupling in depolarized ventricular myocytes, which might simulate an ischemic or failing heart.","European journal of pharmacology","9042611",1997,"Netherlands"
"Heterogeneity of nicotinic receptor class and subunit mRNA expression among individual parasympathetic neurons from rat intracardiac ganglia.","Neurons have the potential to form thousands of distinct neuronal nicotinic receptors from the eight alpha and three beta subunits that currently are known. In an effort to determine how much of this potential complexity is realized among individual neurons, we examined the nicotinic pharmacological and biophysical properties and receptor subunit mRNA expression patterns in individual neurons cultured from rat epicardial ganglia. Analysis of the whole-cell pharmacology of these neurons showed a diversity of responses to the agonists acetylcholine, nicotine, cytisine, and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium, suggesting that a heterogeneous population of nicotinic receptor classes, or subtypes, is expressed by individual neurons. Single-channel analysis demonstrated three distinct conductances (18, 24, and 31 pS), with patches from different neurons containing different combinations of these channel classes. We used single-cell RT-PCR to examine nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit mRNA expression by individual neurons. Although mRNAs encoding all eight neuronal nAChR subunits for which we probed (alpha 2-alpha 5, alpha 7, beta 2-beta 4) were present in multicellular cultures, we found that individual epicardial neurons express distinct subsets of these nAChR subunit mRNAs. These results suggest that individual epicardial neurons express distinct arrays of nAChR subunits and that these subunits may assemble into functional receptors with distinct and variable subunit composition. This variable receptor subunit expression provides an explanation for the diversity of pharmacological and single-channel responses we have observed in individual neurons.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","8987781",1997,"United States"
"Diabetes rapidly induces contractile dysfunctions in isolated ventricular myocytes.","To determine whether diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction is due to contractile dysfunction at the single-cell level, mechanical properties and Ca2+ transients were evaluated in ventricular myocytes isolated from diabetic rats. Rats were made diabetic by injection with streptozotocin and killed either 4-6 days or 8 wk after treatment. Shortening and relengthening (twitch) properties were evaluated in isolated myocytes with a high-resolution (120-Hz) video-based edge-detection system during electrical stimulation between 0.1 and 5 Hz. A separate cohort of myocytes was loaded with fura 2 to assess intracellular Ga2+ transients. Long-term (8-wk) but not short-term (4- to 6-day) diabetes depressed peak twitch amplitude. Diabetes markedly prolonged both the contraction and relaxation phases from both diabetic models. Additionally, 35% of the long-term diabetic myocytes could not pace at 5 Hz, and 48% of the short-term diabetic myocytes developed a hypercontracture at that frequency. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements showed slower Ca(2+)-transient decays in myocytes from short-term diabetic rats. These data demonstrate that contractile dysfunction seen in the diabetic heart is due, in part, to abnormalities of the myocyte. Furthermore, these abnormalities are present after only 4-6 days of diabetes, suggesting a rapid alteration in the processes regulating myocyte shortening and relengthening, which likely include impaired Ca2+ sequestration or extrusion.","The American journal of physiology","9038933",1997,"United States"
"Multiple G-protein involvement in parathyroid hormone regulation of acid production by osteoclasts.","The involvement of multiple G-proteins in parathyroid hormone regulation of acid production was demonstrated in a highly enriched osteoclast population. Osteoclasts were isolated from the endosteum of 2.5 to 3-week-old chicken tibia using sequential enzymatic digestion. Single cell analysis of acid production was accomplished using microscope photometry and vital staining with acridine orange, a hydrogen ion concentration sensitive fluorescent dye. Lithium chloride, an uncoupler of G-proteins from their respective receptors, blocked parathyroid hormone stimulated production of acid. Cholera toxin, which permanently activates Gs-proteins, mimicked PTH stimulation. Pertussis toxin, which prevents receptor interaction with Gi- and Go-proteins, blocked both 10(-8) M and 10(-11) M PTH stimulated acid production, suggesting that the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein is utilized at both PTH concentrations. Immunoblots of osteoclast plasma membrane proteins, using a panel of antibodies generated against specific G-protein alpha subunits, revealed a 48 kDa Gs alpha, a 41 kDa Go alpha, a 34 kDa Gi alpha-3, and a unique 68 kDa G alpha subunit, with the 41 kDa and 34 kDa bands being the most intense. Immunoblots of osteoblast plasma membrane proteins had a substantially different profile with the most intense bands being a Gs alpha (48 kDa) and a Go alpha (36 and 38 kDa). The studies suggest the utilization of at least two different G-proteins in the parathyroid hormone regulation of acid formation by osteoclasts, a Gs and a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (Go and/or Gi alpha-3).","Journal of cellular biochemistry","9015764",1997,"United States"
"Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. Involvement of the sphingolipid signaling cascade in cardiac cell death.","In the present study, it was shown that physiologically relevant levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha induced apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes in vitro, as quantified by single cell microgel electrophoresis of nuclei (&quot;cardiac comets&quot;) as well as by morphological and biochemical criteria. It was also shown that TNFalpha stimulated production of the endogenous second messenger, sphingosine, suggesting sphingolipid involvement in TNFalpha-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, sphingosine strongly induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The ability of the appropriate stimulus to drive cardiomyocytes into apoptosis indicated that these cells were primed for apoptosis and were susceptible to clinically relevant apoptotic triggers, such as TNFalpha. These findings suggest that the elevated TNFalpha levels seen in a variety of clinical conditions, including sepsis and ischemic myocardial disorders, may contribute to TNFalpha-induced cardiac cell death. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is also discussed in terms of its potential beneficial role in limiting the area of cardiac cell involvement as a consequence of myocardial infarction, viral infection, and primary cardiac tumors.","The Journal of clinical investigation","8981934",1996,"United States"
"Reliable sex determination of mouse preimplantation embryos by PCR amplification of male-specific genes in single blastomeres.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability of sex determination in mouse preimplantation embryos using the two-step polymerase chain reaction method.SETTING: Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Division of Reproductive Medicine, Department of OB/GYN.METHODS: The Sry and Zfy genes, known to be present in the sex-determining region of mouse Y chromosome, were selected for Y-specific target sequences and DXNds 3 locus located on mouse X chromosome was served as the internal control sequence. DNAs extracted from heart blood of male and female mice were used to test the correctness and specificity of the selected primers using the two-step PCR method. The same experimental conditions were then used to amplify the single copy genes in single mouse blastomeres with two pairs of primers for each of the target sequences. The sex-determined embryos were transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant recipients to test the consistency of the assay system.RESULTS: All male and female blood DNA sample results confirmed the correct sex identification of the origin (100%). Nineteen of 20 single blastomeres showed the accurate diagnosis when compared with theirs 7/8 embryos. The sex of 36 of 37 mouse pups born from biopsied male and female embryos agreed with the predicted sex.CONCLUSION: The reliable genetic analysis of sex chromosome- specific sequences in single cell is possible by the two-step PCR method and could be applied for diagnosis of defective genes of human preimplantation embryos derived from the in vitro fertilization program.","Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet","9071071",1996,"Thailand"
"Length-dependent mechanisms in single cardiac cells.","This brief review looks at recent work investigating length-dependent mechanisms in single cardiac cells. Studies using the mechanically simple single cardiac cell have confirmed much of the data previously reported in multicellular preparations, although some differences between single cell and multicellular studies have been found. Electrical studies have been able to investigate the effects of stretch on ion channels and have concentrated upon the exciting discovery of many types of stretch-activated channels in the heart. These channels may explain the occurrence of length-dependent changes in pacemaker activity and stretch-activated arrhythmias in the whole heart. Prolonged stretch can lead to hypertrophy, and single cell studies have been able to characterize the sequence of events leading from membrane stretch to altered protein expression. It appears from these studies that the role of angiotensin II is important.","Experimental physiology","8960696",1996,"United Kingdom"
"Prevention of hyperacute rejection by human decay accelerating factor in xenogeneic perfused working hearts.","As a potential source of organs for xenotransplantation, pigs that are transgenic for human decay accelerating factor (DAF) have been bred in order to overcome hyperacute rejection. We investigated the protective effect of human DAF in a porcine working heart model perfused by human blood. Hearts of normal landrace pits served as controls. The following parameters were measured: stroke work index, coronary flow and arteriovenous oxygen consumption, 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha and prostaglandin E2 as markers of endothelial cell activation; creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase for evaluation of the extent of myocardial damage; TNFalpha and IL-6 as markers of mononuclear cell activation. Histological and ultrastructural investigations from myocardial tissue sections were done at the end of perfusion. Human (h) DAF appeared to inhibit complement-mediated endothelial cell activation of transgenic pig hearts successfully. This was in contrast to landrace pig hearts, which had a sixfold increase of prostaglandin levels during perfusion with human blood. The cardiac weight increase during perfusion time due to interstitial edema tended to be less in the hDAF group. Myocardial damage was minimal in transgenic hearts, whereas normal pig hearts produced a threefold increase of creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels. In these hearts, electron microscopy revealed single cell necrosis of myocytes and vacuolization of mitochondria with cristae rupture. According to the results obtained in the working heart model, the breeding of pigs that are transgenic for hDAF represents a promising step to making heart xenotransplantation a clinical reality in the future.","Transplantation","8824468",1996,"United States"
"Vagal control of sinoatrial rhythm: a mathematical model.","The ionic mechanisms underlying vagal control of the cardiac pacemaker were investigated using a new single cell mathematical model of sinoatrial node electrical activity. The model was formulated from a wide range of electrophysiological data available in the literature, with particular reference to whole cell recordings from enzymatically isolated sinoatrial node cells. Development of the model was prompted by the lack of an existing physiologically accurate formulation of sinoatrial node activity that could reproduce the known complex chronotropic response of the pacemaker to brief-burst vagal stimulation, as observed in whole animal and isolated sinus node preparations. Features of the model include the dynamic modulation of the hyperpolarisation-activated current (i(f)) and the L-type calcium current (iCa,L) by acetylcholine, the improved characterisation of the muscarinic potassium current (iK,ACh), assigning the entire background potassium current (ib,K) to spontaneous openings of its channels, and the utilisation of second order kinetics for acetylcholine within the neuroeffector junction. Simulations performed using brief vagal stimuli elicited a strong hyperpolarisation of the membrane which prolonged the cycle in which it was delivered in a phase-dependent manner. This phase-dependency was presented in the form of a standard phase response curve which was characterised by a positive linear slope region, a breakpoint characteristic and a &quot;no effect&quot; zone in which the vagal pulse could no longer prolong the cycle. The breakpoint was manifested as a discontinuity in the curve which was examined by bracketing this point at the limit of the double precision arithmetic employed. At these boundary points on either side of the breakpoint, the vagal stimulus was able to activate outward iK,ACh in such a manner as to finely balance the increasing inward iCa,L trying to generate phase 0 upstroke. On decay of iK,ACh, the membrane either subsequently repolarised or fired to produce an action potential depending on the precise phase of the stimulus. The positive linear slope portion of the PRC was characterised by a strong resetting type behaviour in which the membrane hyperpolarised to approximately the same value, irrespective of the phase of stimulus delivery. For vagal stimulus bursts applied throughout the &quot;no effect&quot; zone, outward iK,ACh was not sufficiently activated in order to overcome the strong inward drive of iCa,L and could not prevent upstroke occurring. For these vagal stimuli, the subsequent cycle was hyperpolarised and prolonged. The size of the &quot;no effect&quot; zone was directly related to the inherent latency incorporated in the activation characteristic of iK,ACh. In contrast to previous models of vagal pacemaker control, our new model was able to reproduce the classical triphasic chronotropic response to brief vagal stimulation characterised by a primary inhibition response, a postinhibitory rebound and a secondary inhibition response. In particular, the postinhibitory rebound was due to activation of the inward hyperpolarisation-activated current by the vagally-induced membrane hyperpolarisation, whilst the secondary inhibition phase resulted from the inhibition of the hyperpolarisation-activated current by acetylcholine. The model suggests that the complex chronotropic responses of the cardiac pacemaker to brief vagal stimulation arises from inherent ionic mechanisms operating within the sinoatrial node.","Journal of theoretical biology","8917735",1996,"England"
"Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-deficient mice are resistant to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced toxicity.","Acute exposure of mammals to the environmental pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) results in a diverse set of toxicologic and pathologic effects. The mechanism of some of these effects has been studied extensively in vitro and correlative studies have indicated the involvement of a transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). However, a definitive association of the AHR with TCDD-mediated toxicity has been difficult to establish due to the diversity of effects and the ubiquitous expression of this receptor. In an effort to distinguish AHR-mediated TCDD toxicities from those resulting from alternative pathways, we have made use of the recently described AHR-deficient mouse that was generated by locus-specific homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Present studies demonstrate that AHR-deficient mice are relatively unaffected by doses of TCDD (2000 micrograms/kg) 10-fold higher than that found to induce severe toxic and pathologic effects in littermates expressing a functional AHR. Analyses of liver, thymus, heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, lymph nodes, and uterus from AHR-deficient mice identified no significant TCDD-induced lesions. The resistance of AHR-deficient mice to TCDD-induced thymic atrophy appears restricted to processes involving AHR since the corticosteroid dexamethasone rapidly and efficiently induced cortical depletion in both AHR-deficient and normal littermate control mice. Taken together these results suggest that the pathological changes induced by TCDD in the liver and thymus are mediated entirely by the AHR. However, it is important to note that at high doses of TCDD, AHR-deficient mice displayed limited vasculitis and scattered single cell necrosis in their lungs and livers, respectively. The mechanism(s) responsible for these apparently receptor-independent processes remain unclear but may involve novel, alternative pathways for TCDD-induced toxicity.","Toxicology and applied pharmacology","8806883",1996,"United States"
"A method for making rapid changes of superfusate whilst maintaining temperature at 37 degrees C.","We have developed a technique for making a rapid solution change, whilst at the same time maintaining the temperature of the preparation at 37 degrees C. It is technically difficult to use rapid solution changes when experiments are performed at normal mammalian body temperature. As a solution is heated from room temperature to 37 degrees C, gas bubbles form in the rapid-flowing solution streams, and these disturb a cell or attached recording pipettes. We describe a system that has been developed to eliminate these problems. We show how to construct the different components of the system, and we have designed an electronic circuit to control solution changes. We have performed tests to characterise the function of this system. Solution flow out of the nozzle of the device (0.88 ml min-1, linear flow velocity 11.6 cm s-1) caused a fall in the steady-state temperature at the experimental preparation of only 0.3 degrees C. The device which takes between 0.5 and 1 s to completely change the superfusate of a single cell, was used routinely with five different experimental solutions. This system may be valuable in studies which require rapid solution changes to be performed at a normal mammalian body temperature.","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","8772145",1996,"United Kingdom"
"Ion currents underlying sinoatrial node pacemaker activity: a new single cell mathematical model.","The ionic currents underlying autorhythmicity of the mammalian sinoatrial node and their wider contribution to each phase of the action potential have been investigated in this study using a new single cell mathematical model. The new model provides a review and update of existing formulations of sinoatrial node membrane currents, derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data available in the literature. Simulations of spontaneous activity suggest that the dominant mechanism underlying pacemaker depolarisation is the inward background Na+ current, ib,Na. In contrast to previous models, the decay of the delayed rectifying K+ current, iK, was insignificant during this phase. Despite the presence of a pseudo-outward background current throughout the pacemaker range of potentials (Na-K pump+leak currents), the hyperpolarisation-activated current i(f) was not essential to pacemaker activity. A closer inspection of the current-voltage characteristics of the model revealed that the &quot;instantaneous&quot; time-independent current was inward for holding potentials in the pacemaker range, which rapidly became outward within 2 ms due to the inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current, iCa,L. This suggests that reports in the literature in which the net background current is outward throughout the pacemaker range of potentials may be exaggerated. The magnitudes of the action potential overshoot and the maximum diastolic potential were determined largely by the reversal potentials of iCa,L and iK respectively. The action potential was sustained by the incomplete deactivation of iCa,L and the Na-Ca exchanger, iNaCa. Despite the incorporation of &quot;square-root&quot; activation by [K]o of all K+ currents, the model was unable to correctly simulate the response to elevated [K]o.","Journal of theoretical biology","8869126",1996,"England"
"The fate diversity of mesodermal cells within the heart field during chicken early embryogenesis.","In gastrulation stage embryos of birds and mammals, the heart field is established as mesodermal crescents flanking the area rostrolateral to Hensen's node. Subsequent fusion of the bilateral heart primordia gives rise to a single tubular heart consisting of two epithelial layers: an outer myocardium and an inner endocardium. To date, it is uncertain whether these two distinct cell types of the heart arise from common or separate progenitor populations of mesodermal cells within the heart field. By retroviral single cell marking and tracking, we examined the diversity of cell populations present in the heart field of stage 4 chicken embryos. Here we demonstrate that individual mesodermal cells in the heart field gave rise to a clone consisting only of one cell type, either endocardial or myocardial cells; i.e., 95.1% of the mesoderm-derived clones were localized in the myocardium, while 4.9% of them were found in endocardium. No clones containing both of these two cell types were detected. The results suggest that the heart field mesoderm at stage 4 consists of at least two distinct subpopulations, containing more premyocardial cells than preendocardial cells. If there exists a common precursor of both myocardial and endocardial cells, the lineage diversification must occur at or prior to the arrival of mesodermal cells to the heart field.","Developmental biology","8660893",1996,"United States"
"Molecular and functional identification of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in rat ventricular myocytes.","The expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes in freshly isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes was investigated by reverse transcription of cellular mRNA followed by amplification of cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After reverse-transcriptase PCR, bands were obtained corresponding to the expected sizes for the m1 and m2 but not for the m3 to m5 mAChRs. The identity of the m1 and m2 bands was confirmed by single-cell PCR, restriction digest mapping, and Southern blot analysis. The presence of m1 and m2, but not m3, mAChR protein in these cells was shown by indirect immunofluorescence studies using subtype-specific antibodies. It was further investigated whether the identified m1 mAChR was responsible for the stimulatory effects on Ca2+ transients by high concentrations of carbachol ( &gt; 10 mumol/L) known to occur in these cells. In pertussis toxin-treated ventricular myocytes electrically stimulated at 1 Hz, carbachol (300 mumol/L) increased the basal Ca2+ level from 96 +/- 7 to 118 +/- 8 nmol/L and the peak Ca2+ transient level from 519 +/- 32 to 640 +/- 36 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM P &lt; .05 for both, n = 8). These effects of carbachol on Ca2+ transients were antagonized by 10 nmol/L pirenzepine, an m1 mAChR-selective antagonist. In contrast, the m2 mAChR-selective antagonist methoctramine (up to 100 nmol/L) did not inhibit the response. These results are the first to use single-cell PCR to probe cardiomyocyte-specific gene expression and indicate that m1 mAChRs are expressed on adult rat ventricular myocytes in addition to m2 mAChRs. The results further suggest that m1 mAChRs mediate the stimulatory responses on Ca2+ transients to high concentrations of cholinergic agonists seen in these cells.","Circulation research","8925573",1996,"United States"
"Preclinical evaluation of single-cell oils that are highly enriched with arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.","Arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are important in human brain and retina development, and there is growing evidence showing the importance of these fatty acids in infant nutrition. Triglyceride oils, highly enriched in ARA (ARASCO) and DHA (DHASCO), were evaluated using very high dose acute (20 g/kg) and 4-wk subchronic gavage feedings in weanling Sprague-Dawley rats. The combination of these oils, Formulaid, was also tested in the 4-wk subchronic study, ARASCO, DHASCO and Formulaid were found to have a no-observable-adverse-effect level of more than 2.5 g/ kg/day, 1.25 g/kg/day and 3.75 g/kg/day, respectively. This represents a 50-fold safety margin over the intended use of Formulaid in infant formula. Survival, clinical signs, body weight gain, food consumption, haematology, clinical chemistry and histopathological evaluations failed to show any significant differences in animals administered ARASCO, DHASCO or Formulaid compared with that in control animals administered equal amounts of high oleic sunflower oil. The bioavailability of ARASCO, DHASCO and Formulaid was verified by increases in DHA and ARA levels in heart and liver tissues in these animals. Because these oils are enriched in only a single bioactive fatty acid, and they have been shown to be safe, they may offer a new source of these fatty acids in speciality foods such as infant formula.","Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association","8761351",1996,"England"
"[Developmental changes in the pacemaker current and membrane currents of the guinea pig myocardium].","The pacemaker current (I(f)) in embryonic chick ventricular myocytes is present, but decreases during development. beta-Adrenergic agonists stimulate I(f), whereas muscarinic cholinergic agonists inhibit I(f) and reverse beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. G-proteins directly and indirectly couple autonomic receptors to I(f) channels in embryonic ventricular cells. The I(f) may contribute partly to the electrogenesis of the pacemaker potential. On the other hand, Ito current, voltage-dependent and 4-AP-sensitive, exists even in young embryonic cardiomyocytes, but not in all cells. The Ito increases during development, resulting in modulation of the action potential configuration. The action potential duration of guinea pig ventricular myocardium decreases during the late fetal period and increases postnatally. Single cell voltage clamp analyses revealed that the decrease and increase in action potential duration are due to developmental increases in the current densities of the calcium current and delayed rectifier potassium current, respectively. The role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in contraction and relaxation of the guinea pig myocardium increases during fetal development.","Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

"A factor from Trypanosoma cruzi induces repetitive cytosolic free Ca2+ transients in isolated primary canine cardiac myocytes.","An unusual 120-kDa alkaline peptidase contained in a trypomastigote soluble fraction (TSF) of Trypanosoma cruzi is associated with the induction of repetitive Ca2+ transients and subsequent invasion by the parasite of a number of mammalian cell lines, including tissue culture L6E2 myoblasts (B. A. Burleigh and N. W. Andrews, J. Biol. Chem. 270:5172-5180, 1995; S. N. J. Moreno, J. Silva, A. E. Vercesi, and R. Docampo, J. Exp. Med. 180:1535-1540, 1994; A. Rodr¨ªguez, M. G. Rioult, A. Ora, and N. W. Andrews, J. Cell Biol. 129:1263-1273, 1995; I. Tardieux, M. H. Nathanson, and N. W. Andrews, J. Exp. Med. 179:1017-1022, 1994). Using single cell spectrofluorometry and whole-cell patch clamping, we show that TSF produces rapid repetitive cytosolic Ca2+ transients (each associated with cell contraction) in primary cardiac myocytes isolated from dogs. The response of myocytes to TSF was dose dependent in that increasing numbers of cells responded to increasing concentrations of TSF. The TSF-induced Ca2+ transients could be obliterated when TSF was heated or treated with trypsin or the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Aprotinin, pepstatin A, and E-64 did not affect TSF activity. The TSF-induced Ca2+ transients and trypomastigote cell invasion could not be inhibited by alpha (prazosin)- or beta (propanolol)-adrenergic blockers or L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (verapamil, nisoldipine, or cadmium) or by removal of extracellular Ca2+. However, inhibition of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (with thapsigargin or ryanodine) prevented the TSF-induced Ca2+ transients and cell invasion by trypomastigotes. These data suggested that cardiac myocyte pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are associated with the regulation of TSF-induced Ca2+ transients and myocyte invasion by trypomastigotes but are independent of Ca2+ entry into the cytosol via L-type Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ transients are dependent on release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, but this release is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+ or on the classic model of Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release in cardiac myocytes. Further, subthreshold depolarizations, together with cell contraction as demonstrated by whole-cell patch clamping, occurred with each Ca2+ transient. However, the depolarizations were of magnitude insufficient to generate an action potential, providing further evidence for a lack of dependence on L-type Ca2+ channels and other voltage-dependent channels (Na+ and K+ channels) in the generation of TSF-induced Ca2+ transients. Our findings suggest that primary canine cardiac myocytes respond to TSF and parasite invasion in ways similar to those of the in vitro cell lines studied to date. Since cardiac myocytes are primary targets for T. cruzi in the vertebrate host, our study indicates that TSF may play a role in the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease in humans.","Infection and immunity","8613390",1996,"United States"
"Expression and function of ryanodine receptors in nonexcitable cells.","We have used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to investigate the expression of ryanodine receptors in several excitable and nonexcitable cell types. Consistent with previous reports, we detected ryanodine receptor expression in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. In addition, we detected ryanodine receptor expression in various other excitable cells including PC 12 and A7r5 cells. Several muscle cell lines (BC3H1, C2C12, L6, and Sol8) weakly expressed ryanodine receptor when undifferentiated but strongly expressed type 1 and type 3 ryanodine receptor isoforms when differentiated into a muscle phenotype. Only 2 (HeLa and LLC-PK1 cells) out of 11 nonexcitable cell types examined expressed ryanodine receptors. Expression of ryanodine receptors at the protein level in these cells was confirmed using [3H]ryanodine binding. We also investigated the function of ryanodine receptors in Ca2+ signaling in HeLa cells using single-cell Fura-2 imaging. Neither caffeine nor ryanodine caused a detectable elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in single HeLa cells. However, ryanodine caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of Ca 2+ signals evoked by repetitive stimulation with ATP. These studies show that ryanodine receptors are expressed in some nonexcitable cell types and furthermore suggest that the ryanodine receptors may be involved in a subtle regulation of intracellular Ca2+ responses.","The Journal of biological chemistry","8626432",1996,"United States"
"Developmental changes in the effects of pH on contraction and Ca2+ current in rabbit heart.","Protons inhibit Ca2+ current and contraction in heart muscle. The present study compares the effects of lowering the pH of the bath solution on single-cell contraction, action potential configuration and Ca2+ currents between neonatal and adult rabbit hearts. We found that a reduction of extracellular pH from 7.3 to 6.3 decreased cell contraction amplitude to 84.3% of control in isolated neonatal myocytes. A comparable change in extracellular pH resulted in a decrease in cell contraction to 56.2% of control in adult cells. Similarly, tension generation in intact neonatal papillary muscles was less sensitive to a decrease in external pH as compared to papillary muscles from adult animals. In addition, acidosis caused a less pronounced inhibition of Ca2+ current in neonatal cells than in adult cells (85 +/- 4% nu 62 +/- 4% of control, pH = 6.3, P &lt; 0.001; 63 +/- 5% nu 32 +/- 5% of control, pH = 5.8, P &lt; 0.001). Thus, the effect of external acidosis on myocardial contractility is commensurate with the effect on trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ current. The membrane potential at which peak Ca2+ current occurred was not altered by low pH in neonatal cells but was shifted toward positive potentials by 17.7 mV in adult myocytes. Further, low external pH solution reduced Ca2+ current conductance more in adult cells than in neonatal cells. Moreover, action potential configuration in neonatal cells was altered less by acidosis as compared with adult cells.

Inhomogeneity in calcium affinity or in cross-bridge kinetics is first simulated by analyzing two fiber segments connected as parallel or serial duplexes. The calculated characteristics of the parallel duplex are tested against our experimental data with two parallel nonuniform rat papillary fibers. The predicted serial duplex behavior is compared with reported experimental data of the effects of segmental hypoxia along a papillary fiber. Fiber inhomogeneity leads to polyphasic contraction of the fiber segments, reduces muscle length shortening, and affects the control of relaxation. We next investigated the force generated by a nonuniform tissue containing small areas of necrosis, evident in subendocardial infarction. Theoretical analysis suggests that the IC mechanism decreases the extension of cell necrosis by lowering the energy consumption of the viable cells in the ischemic zone. The study emphasizes the importance of IC in determining the global and local function of the inhomogeneous myocardium.","The American journal of physiology","8780209",1996,"United States"
"Cytosolic Ca2+ domain-dependent protective action of adenosine in cardiomyocytes.","Recently, in beating cardiac cells heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns in cytosolic Ca2+ distribution have been visualized, and associated with cell contraction. In non-beating cardiomyocytes, spatial heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ distribution has also been observed, yet its functional implication in resting cardiac cells is not known. Herein, distinct domains of lower versus higher concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ (0.17 and 0.37 microM, respectively) were observed using epifluorescent digital imaging in single, non-beating, fluo-3-loaded cardiomyocytes. Extracellular K+ (16 mM) induced a uniform increase of cytosolic Ca2+, despite the initial presence of distinct domains of cytosolic Ca2+ (from 0.17 to 1.82 microM in domains with lower, and from 0.37 to 2.03 microM in domains with higher Ca2+ concentration, respectively). In contrast, adenosine (1 mM) prevented exracellular K+ to induce cytosolic Ca2+ loading selectively within domains with lower (from 0.17 to 0.18 microM), but not in domains with higher (from 0.37 to 1.4 microM) basal Ca2+ concentration. Thus, the response of a cardiomyocyte to the protective action of adenosine is heterogeneous within a resting single cell. The domain-distinct cytoprotective action of adenosine appears to be set by the basal Ca2+ concentration within a cytosolic domain.","European journal of pharmacology","8867921",1996,"Netherlands"
"[Introduction to the structure and functions of junction communications or gap junctions].","Cell-to-cell communication through gap junctions (GJ) represents a direct route of exchange of informations between neighboring cells within tissues and organs. GJ are formed from the assembly of a large number of channels that differ from the other known channels because they connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. The GJ channel is built from two parts: the connexons. A connexon inserted into the plasma membrane of a cell interacts with another connexon belonging to an adjacent cell. Connexons are composed of proteins with four transmembrane domains that are named connexins (Cx). Six Cx form a connexon. Cx belong to a protein family with 13 known members at present. Each Cx is defined by its molecular mass in kDa (ex: Cx32, Cx43...). A given cell type expresses one or several Cx. The cell to cell transfer of molecules through GJ channels exhibit a size selectivity; only molecules with a molecular mass lower than 1000 Da such as ions and second messengers freely pass through GJ. Depending on the Cx they are made of, GJ seem to differ somewhat in their permeability properties. Cell-to-cell communication via GJ is a regulated process. GJ channels can be either open or closed. GJ mediated cell-to-cell communication or junctional coupling can be detected and quantified by visualization of the cell to cell transfer of a fluorescent probe (such as Lucifer Yellow...) previously introduced in a single cell by microinjection. The presence of GJ channels can also be identified by recording the passage of an electric current between contiguous cells. GJ are involved in numerous fundamental biological processes from the embryonic development to the homeostasis in adult tissues and organs. GJ coordinate cell activities and sometimes synchronize cell behaviour. This is the case for the propagation of the excitation wave in the cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. GJ mediate metabolic cooperation between cells; they represent a way of supply of nutrients for tissues that are weakly or not vascularized. GJ take part in the control of cell proliferation. The loss of GJ-mediated cell-to-cell communication is a common feature of transformed cells and the re-establishment of junctional coupling is associated with a decrease of tumoregenicity. Allowing the cell-to-cell transfer of second messengers, GJ participate (and sometimes control) the response of a cell population to signalling molecules. It is known for example that hormones influence the expression of Cx and thus the level of the junctional coupling and that communication via GJ has an effect on the type and extent of action of hormones.","Annales d'endocrinologie","9084693",1996,"France"
"[Characterization of outward current in mouse ventricular myocytes].","Depolarization-activated, calcium-independent outward currents (Iout) in enzymatically dispersed mouse ventricular myocytes were characterized by whole-cell recording technique. During brief depolarizations to potentials positive to -50 mV, outward K+ currents in these cells rise rapidly to a peak followed by a slower decay to an apparent plateau. The relative peak to plateau amplitudes in a single cell varied as a function of the holding potential (HP) from which the currents were evoked. Reversal potentials for the peak and plateau components were -64.3 +/- 3.9 mV and -53.3 +/- 2.9 mV, respectively (uncorrected for junction potentials). The outward current decay is well described by double exponential fits, whereas the time course of peak Iout decay following a 500 ms prepulse is best fitted by single exponential function, indicating the presence of two distinct components, IKf and IKs, of the outward currents in mouse ventricular cells. Application of 4-AP were accompanied by a marked attenuation of peak Iout and plateau Iout, indicating that both IKf and IKs display similar sensitivities to 4-AP. The steady state inactivation of IKf is found incomplete within the test potential range (-80 - +30 mV) owing probably to the fact that the APD of mouse myocardium is too short.","Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica]","8762443",1995,"China"
"Alpha-adrenergic agonist and endothelin-1 induced intracellular Ca2+ response in the presence of a Ca2+ entry blocker in cultured rat ventricular myocytes.","Previously we demonstrated that stimulation of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes by either alpha 1-adrenergic agonist or endothelin-1 resulted in a rapid formation of total inositolphosphates, although the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate did not rise significantly. The aim of this study was to examine whether stimulation by alpha 1-adrenergic agonist and endothelin-1 could still elicit phosphatidylinositol cycle mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in these cells. The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by single cell imaging dual wavelength fluorescence microscopy in Fura-2-loaded cardiomyocytes. The interference of agonist induced [Ca2+]i responses by the beat to beat variation of [Ca2+]i was prevented by arresting the cells with the Ca2+ entry blocker diltiazem (10 microM). The [Ca2+]i response (expressed as % of baseline ratio of fluorescence intensities of Fura-2 at 340 nm and 380 nm excitation wavelength), induced by phenylephrine (10(-4) M) and endothelin-1 (10(-8) M) was small, up to 20% of baseline after 9-20 min. In contrast, Ca(2+)-influx induced by incubation in Na(+)-free buffer caused a steep increase of [Ca2+]i up to 150% of baseline after 30 s. Analysis of single cells following stimulation with phenylephrine or endothelin-1 showed heterogeneity with respect to a rise in [Ca2+]i. However, if rapid Ca(2+)-influx was induced by incubation in Na(+)-free buffer, [Ca2+]i responses in individual myocytes occurred homogeneously. It is concluded that the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist and endothelin-1 induced [Ca2+]i responses are delayed in time, small and quite heterogeneous among cells. The findings are in agreement with earlier observations which revealed no detectable overall increase of the Ca2+ releasing inositolphosphates under these conditions and suggest that other second messengers, such as 1,2-diacylglycerol, are involved in the agonist mediated Ca2+ signals.","Cell calcium","8746950",1995,"Netherlands"
"TNF alpha receptor expression in rat cardiac myocytes: TNF alpha inhibition of L-type Ca2+ current and Ca2+ transients.","Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) is a potentially powerful anti-neoplastic agent; however, its therapeutic usefulness is limited by its cardiotoxic and negative inotropic effects. Accordingly, studies were undertaken to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of TNF alpha-mediated cardiodepression. Single cell RT-PCR, [125I]TNF alpha ligand binding and Western immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that rat cardiac cells predominantly express type I TNF alpha receptors (TNFRI or p60). TNF alpha inhibited cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel current (ICa) and contractile Ca2+ transients. Thus, it is possible that the negative inotropic effects of TNF alpha are the result of TNFRI-mediated blockade of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.","FEBS letters","8521959",1995,"United States"
"Cloche, an early acting zebrafish gene, is required by both the endothelial and hematopoietic lineages.","Endothelial and hematopoietic cells appear synchronously on the extra-embryonic membranes of amniotes in structures known as blood islands. This observation has led to the suggestion that these two ventral lineages share a common progenitor. Recently, we have shown in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, that a single cell in the ventral marginal zone of the early blastula can give rise to both endothelial and blood cells as well as to other mesodermal cells (Stainier, D. Y. R., Lee, R. K. and Fishman, M. C. (1993). Development 119, 31-40; Lee, R. K. K., Stainier, D. Y. R., Weinstein, B. M. and Fishman, M. C. (1994). Development 120, 3361-3366). Here we describe a zebrafish mutation, cloche, that affects both the endothelial and hematopoietic lineages at a very early stage. The endocardium, the endothelial lining of the heart, is missing in mutant embryos. This deletion is selective as evidenced by the presence of other endothelial cells, for example those lining the main vessels of the trunk. Early cardiac morphogenesis proceeds normally even in the absence of the endocardium. The myocardial cells form a tube that is demarcated into chambers, beats rhythmically, but exhibits a reduced contractility. This functional deficit is likely due to the absence of the endocardial cells, although it may be a direct effect of the mutation on the myocardial cells. Cell transplantation studies reveal that the endothelial defect, i.e. the endocardial deletion, is a cell-autonomous lesion, consistent with the possibility that cloche is part of a signal transduction pathway. In addition, the number of blood cells is greatly reduced in cloche mutants and the hematopoietic tissues show no expression of GATA-1 or GATA-2, two key hematopoietic transcription factors that are first expressed during early embryogenesis. These results show that cloche is involved in the genesis and early diversification of the endothelial and blood lineages, possibly by affecting a common progenitor cell population.","Development (Cambridge, England)","7588049",1995,"England"
"Modeling direction selectivity of simple cells in striate visual cortex within the framework of the canonical microcircuit.","Nearly all models of direction selectivity (DS) in visual cortex are based on feedforward connection schemes, where geniculate input provides all excitatory synaptic input to both pyramidal and inhibitory neurons. Feedforward inhibition then suppresses feedforward excitation for nonoptimal stimuli. Anatomically, however, the majority of asymmetric, excitatory, synaptic contacts onto cortical cells is provided by other cortical neurons, as embodied in the Canonical Microcircuit of Douglas and Martin (1991). In this view, weak geniculate input is strongly amplified in the preferred direction by the action of intracortical excitatory connections, while in the null direction inhibition reduces geniculate-induced excitation. We investigate analytically and through biologically realistic computer simulations the functioning of a cortical network based on massive excitatory, cortico-cortical feedback. The behavior of this network is compared to physiological data as well as to the behavior of a purely feedforward model of DS based on nonlagged input. Our model explains a number of puzzling features of direction selective simple cells, including the small somatic input conductance changes that have been measured experimentally during stimulation in the null direction, and the persistence of DS while fully blocking inhibition in a single cell. Although the operation at the heart of our network is amplification, the network passes the linearity test of (Jagadeesh et al., 1993). We make specific predictions concerning the effect of selective blockade of cortical inhibition on the velocity-response curve.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","7472430",1995,"United States"
"Spontaneous calcium waves without contraction in cardiac myocytes.","Spontaneous Ca2+ waves were visualized in quiescent cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probe, Fluo-3, and imaged by laser confocal microscopy. No sarcomere shortening was detected during wave propagation. This type of Ca2+ waves began at the periphery or in a central region of a myocyte and propagated the length of the cell in one or two directions. The average velocity of wave propagation was 32 microns/sec and the estimated concentration of Ca2+ oscillated from 124, at the bottom, to 311 nM, at the pick of the wave. Ca2+ waves were not confined to a single cell but could spread from cell to cell. These results describe a type of spontaneous Ca2+ waves which does not induce a contractile response in cardiomyocytes.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","7575544",1995,"United States"
"Optical multisite monitoring of cell excitation phenomena in isolated cardiomyocytes.","An especially designed setup which consists of an inverted fluorescence microscope, an argon ion laser and a photodiode array system permits membrane potential monitoring in isolated guinea-pig ventricular cardiomyocytes, stained with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS, which responds linearly with relative fluorescence changes (delta F/F) approximately -8% per 100 mV. About a dozen measuring spots covering a single cell were simultaneously monitored with a spatial and temporal resolution of 15 microns and about 20 microseconds, respectively. In general, the rising phases of the action potentials within a single cell were highly synchronized (i.e. all upstroke velocities peaked within about 20 microseconds); however, in one cell (out of 25 examined) significant (P &lt; 0.05) time lags exceeding the signal-dependent time resolution were also found. Experiments, simultaneously performed with our optical system and a widely used patch-clamp setup, revealed a slowed and delayed response of the clamp amplifier depending on the cell access resistance. Optical monitoring during whole-cell voltage-clamping demonstrated the influence of graduated series resistance compensation. When field stimulation was used, our results clearly demonstrated the spatially dependent polarization of the cell membrane during the stimulus, as well as a highly synchronized upstroke development. Slight differences in the maximum upstroke velocities within a single cell were also found and were basically in agreement with mathematical models.","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","7491277",1995,"Germany"
"Modulation of ion gradients and glutamate release in cultured cerebellar granule cells by ouabain.","Upon addition of the cardiac glycoside ouabain to cultured cerebellar granule cells, an immediate increase in intracellular free sodium is evoked mediated by two pathways, a voltage-sensitive channel blocked by tetrodotoxin and a channel sensitive to flunarizine. Ouabain induces a steady plasma membrane depolarization in low Ca2+ medium; whereas in the presence of Ca2+, a distinct discontinuity is observed always preceded by a large increase in intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c). The plateau component of the increase can be inhibited additively by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine, the spider toxin Aga-Gl, and the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Single-cell imaging reveals that the [Ca2+]c increase occurs asynchronously in the cell population and is not dependent on a critical level of extracellular glutamate or synaptic transmission between the cells. A prolonged release of glutamate is also observed that is predominantly Ca2+ dependent for the first 6-10 min after the evoked increase in [Ca2+]c. This release is four times as large as that observed with 50 mM KCl and is predominantly exocytotic because release was inhibited by tetanus toxin, the V-type ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin, and Aga-Gl. It is proposed, therefore, that ouabain induces a period of membrane excitability culminating in a sustained exocytosis above that observed upon permanent depolarization with KCl.","Journal of neurochemistry","7536807",1995,"United Kingdom"
"Subchronic inhalation toxicity of 1,1,1,3-tetrachloropropane in rats.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhalation toxicity of 1,1,1,3-tetrachloropropane (TCP), an intermediate in the production of chlorinated silicone fluids. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 90 days to TCP at concentrations of 0, 25, 75, or 225 ppm (Phase I study) and to 0, 1, 5, or 10 ppm (Phase II study). Phase II of the study was conducted because a no-observed-effect level was not achieved in Phase I. No animals died during the study. Clinical signs of toxicity included oral, nasal, and/or ocular discharge. No statistically significant differences were observed in either body weights or food consumption between exposed and control animals. Clinical pathology did not indicate any treatment-related effects. Absolute and relative liver and kidney weights were increased in male and female rats exposed to 225 ppm TCP, and heart weights were increased in male rats exposed to 225 ppm TCP. The liver and heart weight changes were supported by the findings of microscopic lesions in these organs. These lesions consisted of multifocal/focal myofiber degeneration necrosis with adjacent chronic myocarditis in the heart and multifocal single-cell necrosis in the liver parenchyma. The liver lesions had essentially resolved at the end of a 28-day recovery period but the heart lesions were still present in male rats in the recovery group exposed to 225 ppm TCP. No treatment-related effects were observed in animals exposed to 1, 5, or 10 ppm TCP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology","7601327",1995,"United States"
"A minimal single-channel model for the regularity of beating in the sinoatrial node.","It has been suggested that the normal irregular beating of the heart is a manifestation of deterministically chaotic dynamics. Evidence proffered in support of this hypothesis includes a 1/f-like power spectrum, a small noninteger correlation dimension, and self-similarity of the time series. The major cause of the normal fluctuations in heart rate is the impingement of several neural and hormonal control systems upon the sinoatrial node, the natural pacemaker of the heart. However, intrinsic fluctuations of beat rate can be seen in the isolated node, devoid of all neural and hormonal inputs, and even in a single cell isolated from the node. The electrical activity in such a single cell is generated by ions flowing through discrete channels in the cell membrane.We decided to test the hypothesis that the fluctuations in beat rate in a single cell might be due to the fluctuations in the activity of this population of single channels. We thus assemble a model consisting of 6000 channels and probe its dynamics. Each channel has one or more gates, all of which must be open to allow current to flow through the channel. Since these gates are thought to open and close in a random manner, we model each gate by a Markov process, assigning a pseudorandom number to each gate every time that it changes state from open to closed or vice versa. This number, in conjunction with the classical voltage-dependent Hodgkin-Huxley-like rate constants that control the speed with which a gate will open or close, then determines when that gate will next change state. We also employ a second method that is much more efficient computationally, in which one computes the lifetime of the ensemble of 6000 channels. We show that the Monte Carlo model has behavior consistent with the hypothesis that the irregular beating seen experimentally in single nodal cells is due to the (pseudo)random opening and closing of single channels. However, since the pseudorandom number generator used in the simulations is deterministic, one cannot state that the activity in the model is random (or stochastic). Thus, it would be premature to claim that the irregularity of beating in a single nodal cell is accounted for by the stochastic behavior of a population of a few thousand single channels lying in the membrane of the cell. Finally, we consider some implications of our work for the naturally occurring in situ fluctuations in heart rate (&quot;heart rate variability&quot;).

"Organization and fine structure of a pacemaker derived from fetal rat myocardium.","At an unknown point in mammalian development, cardiac precursor cells become committed to the cardiocyte phenotype. Certain of these are believed to specialize further into pacemaker cardiocytes. By culturing explanted embryonic ventricles into in vivo organ culture (Tucker DC, Snider C, Woods WT Jr: Pediatr Res 23:637-642, 1988), we observed pacemaker cells arising apparently from cardiocytes. We hypothesized that this event can be triggered by intercellular attachments, innervation, vascularization, or other factors. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that primitive ventricular cells in the tubular heart can organize into an anatomically and electrophysiologically distinct pacemaker structure in the absence of innervation or vascularization from extrinsic sources. Developing ventricles of tubular hearts from 10-d-old rat embryos (n = 22) were excised and incubated in culture dishes. Within each explant, a group of cells organized into a uniform cluster (diameter, 150 +/- 50 microns) after 8 +/- 2 d in culture. These cells resembled immature conduction system cells and had electrophysiologic features similar to those of mature pacemaker cells. Single-cell action potentials and impulse conduction patterns proved that the pacemaker cluster was the dominant pacemaker for the entire explant. These results confirm that, in the absence of extrinsic nerves and blood vessels, culture of the tubular ventricle elicits formation of an organized pacemaker, resembling the mature cardiac pacemaker and suggesting that contact with the culture dish surface or some other factor triggers conversion of cardiocytes to the pacemaker phenotype.","Pediatric research","7784136",1995,"United States"

"The effects of mechanical loading and changes of length on single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes.","1. The effects of mechanical loading and changes of length on the contraction of single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes has been investigated. 2. Cell shortening was monitored during isotonic contractions (in which the cell shortened freely) and after attaching carbon fibres of known compliance to the ends of the cell, so that the cell contracted auxotonically (the cell both shortened and developed force). 3. Mechanically loading the cells decreased the amount of shortening during a contraction and abbreviated the contraction. There were, however, no consistent changes in the action potential or the [Ca2+]i transient (measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2). 4. Increasing stimulation rate increased the size of the contraction and the [Ca2+]i transient in both isotonic and auxotonic conditions. The increase in the size of the contraction induced by an increase in stimulation rate was greater in auxotonic conditions but the increase in the size of the [Ca2+]i transient was not. 5. When cells were stretched, there was a step increase in the size of the contraction and a prolongation of its time course. However, neither the size nor the time course of the accompanying [Ca2+]i transient was significantly altered by this intervention. 6. When a stretch was maintained, a further, slow increase in the size of the contraction occurred during the following 3-11 min, in about half the cells studied. The probability of this slow response occurring was increased if the initial degree of activation of the cell was decreased. 7. These data suggest that the mechanisms underlying the responses to mechanical loading and changes of length are the same in both multicellular and single cell preparations of cardiac muscle.","The Journal of physiology","7730993",1995,"United Kingdom"
"Cardiovascular development in the zebrafish. II. Endocardial progenitors are sequestered within the heart field.","We have examined the zebrafish embryo to ascertain the location of endocardial and myocardial progenitors prior to gastrulation, in an attempt to define the earliest stages of cardiac patterning. Currently there is uncertainty as to the spatial and lineage relationship of the progenitors for these two phenotypically distinct cell types that form the two concentric layers of the primitive heart tube. By single-cell injection and tracking, we distinguish a region in the early and midblastula which has the properties of a heart field, in that it defines a zone of cardiac progenitors within which there is a spatial gradient of propensity to generate heart cells, and which regulates, in the sense of adapting to the transplantation of pluripotential cells. This zone extends from the future ventral axis dorsally along the margin, with cardiogenic propensity tapering off laterally and dorsally. Myocardial progenitors are spread throughout this region, but endocardial precursors are restricted to the ventral marginal region. The cardiovascular progeny of the ventral cells include, in addition to endocardium and myocardium, cells in the endothelium and blood.","Development (Cambridge, England)","7821208",1994,"United States"
"[A resected case of sporadic myxoma of the right ventricle: the diagnosis was supported with DNA flow cytometry].","We report a rare case of a 16-year-old male who had myxoma originating from septal band of the right ventricle. His ECG anomaly was found incidentally upon a physical examination. Subsequently, echocardiography and angiocardiography demonstrated a tumor occupying the right ventricular outflow tract and protruding into the main pulmonary artery in systolic phase. He was operated upon using extracorporeal circulation. By right ventriculotomy the tumor was resected together with septal tissue 5 mm around the stalk, which branched into the myocardium. The defect was closed using mattress sutures with Dacron felt strips. We also analyzed the DNA content of the tumor. The DNA flow cytometry yielded a single cell population with diploid DNA content. This result showed that the tumor is sporadic form of cardiac myxoma. His postoperative course was uneventful. Thirty months after the surgery, patient has no sign of recurrence. The DNA flow cytometry is helpful for detecting clinical behavior of the cardiac myxoma, because microscopic examination can not readily distinguish sporadic myxoma from so-called complex myxoma.","Kyobu geka.

"Alterations in angiotensin II receptor mediated signal transduction shortly after coronary artery constriction in the rat.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of coronary artery constriction on the density of angiotensin II receptors and on the effector responses coupled with these receptors on myocytes one week after surgical induction of coronary artery stenosis in rats.METHODS: After induction of coronary artery stenosis and following the estimation of global cardiac performance, myocytes were enzymatically dissociated and radioligand binding studies were performed. In addition, the isotonic contractile performance, cytosolic calcium transients, and angiotensin II stimulated inositol phosphate generation in myocytes were measured in the presence and absence of the angiotensin II receptor subtype antagonist losartan.RESULTS: After documenting left ventricular failure and right ventricular dysfunction, the expression and density of angiotensin II receptors in left ventricular myocytes were evaluated and found to be increased 3.1-fold and 4.1-fold, respectively. Corresponding increases in right ventricular myocytes were 3.6-fold and 4.5-fold. In contrast, the quantity of the regulatory protein Gq alpha was not altered in either ventricle. Angiotensin II did not increase the generation of total inositol phosphates in left and right ventricular myocytes at maximum stimulation. However, the threshold for the formation of inositol phosphates was lowered in left ventricular myocytes of coronary narrowed rats. Measurements of single cell mechanics indicated that angiotensin II stimulation markedly improved the depression in myocyte function biventricularly. This inotropic effect was coupled with the restoration of cytosolic calcium.CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of angiotensin II receptors on myocytes in this model of global ischaemia may be a compensatory mechanism ameliorating myocyte contractility in an attempt to sustain ventricular pump function.","Cardiovascular research","8001047",1994,"United States"
"Intrinsic cytosolic calcium buffering properties of single rat cardiac myocytes.","Intracellular passive Ca2+, buffering was measured in voltage-clamped rat ventricular myocytes. Cells were loaded with indo-1 (K+ salt) to an estimated cytosolic concentration of 44 +/- 5 microM (Mean +/- SEM, n = 5), and accessible cell volume was estimated to be 24.5 +/- 3.6 pl. Ca2+ transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-ATPase and sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchange was inhibited by treatment with thapsigargin and Na-free solutions, respectively. Extracellular [Ca2+] was maintained at 10 mM and, in some experiments, the mitochondrial uncoupler &quot;1799&quot; was used to assess the degree of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. To perform single cell titrations, intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was increased progressively by a train of depolarizing voltage clamp pulses from -40 to +10 mV. The total Ca2+ gain with each pulse was calculated by integration of the Ca current and then analyzed as a function of the rapid change in [Ca2+]i during the pulse. In the range of [Ca2+]i from 0.1 to 2 microM, overall cell buffering was well described as a single lumped Michaelis-Menten type species with an apparent dissociation constant, KD, of of 0.63 +/- 0.07 microM (n = 5) and a binding capacity, Bmax, of 162 +/- 15 mumol/l cell H2O. Correction for buffering attributable to cytosolic indo-1 gives intrinsic cytosolic Ca2+ buffering parameters of KD = 0.96 +/- 0.18 microM and Bmax = 123 +/- 18 mumol/l cell H2O. The fast Ca2+ buffering measured in this manner agrees reasonably with the characteristics of known rapid Ca buffers (e.g., troponin C, calmodulin, and SR Ca-ATPase), but is only about half of the total Ca2+ buffering measured at equilibrium. Inclusion of slow Ca buffers such as the Ca/Mg sites on troponin C and myosin can account for the differences between fast Ca2+ buffering in phase with the Ca current measured in the present experiments and equilibrium Ca2+ buffering. The present data indicate that a rapid rise of [Ca2+]i from 0.1 to 1 microM during a contraction requires approximately 50 microM Ca2+ to be added to the cytosol.","Biophysical journal","7819510",1994,"United States"
"A novel two-compartment culture dish allows microscopic evaluation of two different treatments in one cell culture simultaneously. Influence of external pH on Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity in cultured rat cardiomyocytes.","A new type of culture dish containing two separate compartments is described, that can be used in high-magnification microscopy. Using the dish, two halves of a single-cell culture, grown on a standard coverslip, can be exposed to different treatments simultaneously, allowing the effect of one treatment to be compared with that of the other treatment in the same culture. This way, the natural variability that might exist between different individual cultures is circumvented. In addition, by simultaneously conducting two experiments per dish, the number of experiments needed can be decreased. This both reduces the time to complete a series of experiments and allows the optimal use of specimens that are difficult to obtain, such as human material. We found there is an excellent barrier between the two compartments for lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds, and for low-molecular-mass cations. To illustrate the use of the dish we describe the influence of external pH on the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in intact cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. The intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the cardiomyocytes, measured using fura-2 and imaging fluorescence microscopy, was studied during sodium-free incubation. The resulting rise in [Ca2+]i at pH 7.4 in one compartment was compared with that in the other compartment in which the pH was either 6.0, 7.0, 7.4 or 8.0. It was found that below pH 7.4, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity was diminished, whereas at pH higher than 7.4 the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity was increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","7816552",1994,"Germany"
"The zebrafish as a model system to study cardiovascular development.","The zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, is rapidly becoming a system of choice for vertebrate developmental biologists. It presents unique embryological attributes and is amenable to saturation style mutagenesis, a powerful approach that, in invertebrates, has already led to the identification of a large number of key developmental genes. Since fertilization is external, the zebrafish embryo develops in the dish and is thus accessible for continued observation and manipulation at all stages of development. Furthermore, because the embryo is transparent, the developing heart and vessels can be resolved at the single-cell level. A large number of mutations that affect the development of cardiovascular form and function have recently been isolated from large-scale genetic screens for zygotic embryonic lethals. Our further understanding of the development of the cardiovascular system is important not only because of the high incidence, and familial inheritance, of congenital abnormalities, but also because it should lead to novel, differentiation-based strategies for the analysis and therapy of the diseased state.","Trends in cardiovascular medicine","21244869",1994,"United States"
"Inhomogeneity of cellular activation time and Vmax in normal myocardial tissue under electrical field stimulation.","To clarify the mechanism underlying the ectopic excitation after countershock, the cellular activation processes of cardiac tissue with a low-potential-gradient electric field (LPEF) were investigated in experiments using guinea pig papillary muscles and in computer simulation. Action potential upstrokes in papillary muscles during longitudinal propagation (LP) or transverse propagation (TP) were different from those of nonpropagating ones in single ventricular cells in terms of lower maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) (LP, 231 V/s; TP, 309 V/s) and the presence of a linear ascending segment in the phase-plane plot. High Vmax (409 V/s) close to the single cell (512 V/s) was obtained in the muscle at the collision of LP (LC). Field stimulation of the muscles with LPEF &lt; 5 V/cm caused inhomogeneous excitation suggesting multiple wave fronts, which collide with each other, and a wide spatial dispersion of Vmax (132-388 V/s). Phase-plane plots of action potential with lower Vmax were similar to LP or TP, whereas those with higher Vmax were similar to LC. In the two-dimensional discrete sheet composed of 51 x 51 elements of modified Beeler-Reuter model, the inhomogeneous excitation induced by LPEF is mimicked by setting a random variation of stimulus onset in each element. LPEF may induce inhomogeneous excitation with multiple wave fronts through a complex electrotonic interaction. This would provide a basis for the genesis of ectopic focal excitation.","The American journal of physiology","8067425",1994,"United States"
"Oxidative stress-induced perturbations of calcium homeostasis and cell death in cultured myocytes: role of extracellular calcium.","The role of extracellular calcium in the process of oxidative stress-induced calcium overload and cell death was investigated in cultured neonatal rat myocytes. Oxidative stress was induced by addition of cumene hydroperoxide (CHPO), a toxic organic hydroperoxide, in combination with varying extracellular calcium concentrations (1. normal calcium buffer: 2.5 mM Ca2+, 2. low calcium buffer: 5 microM Ca2+, 3. zero calcium buffer: 2.5 mM EGTA, no CaC12). Intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with fura-2 using a spectrofluorometer. To study the toxicant-induced changes in [Ca2+]i in more detail, single cell imaging was performed using digital imaging fluorescence microscopy (DIFM). In control experiments (in the absence of CHPO, but under different extracellular Ca2+ conditions) the [Ca2+]i remained at the basal level and cell viability was preserved. Administration of CHPO (50 microM) to the myocyte cultures generated a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i followed by loss of cell viability. A low extracellular calcium concentration (5 microM), in the absence or presence of diltiazem (10 microM), induced a delay in the rise in [Ca2+]i but was not able to prevent the CHPO-induced calcium overload and cell necrosis. Addition of EGTA (2.5 mM) to the low calcium buffer resulted also in CHPO-induced cell death, although no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed. In normal and low calcium buffers, DIFM revealed that CHPO produced a temporally and spatially heterogeneous distribution of [Ca2+]i in a group of myocytes. So, in the presence of normal or low extracellular Ca2+, CHPO intoxication of cultured myocytes leads to an increase of [Ca2+]i prior to the onset of cell death. If extracellular Ca2+ is chelated by EGTA, CHPO also induces cell death which is not preceded by cellular calcium overload. Apparently a disturbance in the calcium homeostasis is not causally related with oxidative stress-induced myocardial cell death.","Molecular and cellular biochemistry","7854326",1994,"Netherlands"
"Histopathological analysis of mice born following single cell embryo biopsy.","Single cell embryo biopsy is a useful but invasive technique for preimplantation diagnosis. Biopsy may be performed by physical (direct zona puncture) or chemical methods (zona drilling with acid solution). This study has analysed the safety of a physical method of embryo biopsy in the mouse. Six adult mice (male and female), three from biopsied embryos and three from a control group (non-biopsied) were subjected to histopathological analyses. Macroscopically, the anatomy and morphology of the internal organs in both groups were normal. Microscopic analyses of 15 major organs, which included the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, stomach, intestine, voluntary muscle, spleen, pancreas, adrenal, thymus, skin, testis (male) and ovary (female), in both groups were all normal. These results showed that careful single cell embryo biopsy by direct zona puncture performed at the 8-cell embryo stage had no adverse influence on the macroscopic and microscopic structure of the organs. The remaining pluripotential cells of biopsied embryos developed normal microstructure according to the hereditary messages. Ideally, the safety of embryo biopsy requires observation of three stages after embryo biopsy, namely embryonic and fetal development before birth, neonatal assessment and long-term monitoring after birth.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","7962391",1994,"England"
"Developmental cell-specific regulation of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and alpha 3-isoform gene expression.","Na(+)-K(+)-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase) is the integral membrane protein that maintains the Na(+)-K(+) electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Because of the importance of the Na(+)-K(+) electrochemical gradient to fundamental and specialized cell functions, we investigated the cell-specific modulation of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit isoform (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) gene expression in different stages of postimplantation mouse embryos and neonatal rat tissues by in situ hybridization with use of isoform-specific rat-derived antisense RNA probes. At early organogenesis (9.5-10.5 days postcoitus), we demonstrated generalized coexpression of alpha 1- and alpha 2-isoforms throughout the mouse embryo with greater levels in the developing but already functional heart, in contrast to the distinct spatially restricted alpha 3-isoform gene expression in the early developing neural tube. At midorganogenesis (15.5-16.5 days postcoitus), differential spatial variation in alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and alpha 3-isoform gene expression was already evident in all organs. Interestingly, region-specific expression patterns within single cell types were noted throughout development and were exemplified by 1) alpha 3-isoform gene expression in marginal cells of the 10.5-day-postcoitus developing neural tube; 2) alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and alpha 3-isoform gene expression in cerebellar granular cells of the 4-day-old rat brain; and 3) alpha 1- and alpha 3-isoform gene expression in 4-day-old rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. These isoform-specific changes in cellular and regional Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha-isoform gene expression may play an active role in development and specialized cell functions.","The American journal of physiology","8203495",1994,"United States"

"Isolation and characterization of dendritic cells from mouse heart and kidney.","Dendritic cells (DC) are thought to be distributed throughout lymphoid and most nonlymphoid tissues. Single cell suspensions were prepared from mouse hearts and kidneys. Subsets of MHC class II-positive (Ia+) leukocytes from both sources expressed markers such as CDw32 Fc receptors, F4/80, and complement receptor type 3 (CD11b/CD18). The capacity of these cells to initiate primary in vitro immune responses was assessed using oxidative mitogenesis and allogeneic mixed leukocyte responses. After fractionation by density centrifugation, cell sorting, immunomagnetic bead separation, or cell panning, the stimulatory activity of kidney cell suspensions was found to reside in the low density, Ia+ leukocyte fractions after overnight culture (day 1). In contrast, freshly isolated (day 0) cells had considerably less or no activity in these assays. However, depletion of Ia+ or CD45+ cells on day 0 followed by overnight culture removed the stimulatory activity on day 1. Therefore, day 0 kidney cells contain Ia+ leukocytes that can acquire or up-regulate their stimulatory activity during overnight culture. Similar observations were made for cells isolated from hearts, except that a population of uncharacterized nonleukocytes with stimulatory activity was detected on day 0 but not day 1. The phagocytic capacity of the leukocytes was then examined. Subsets of Ia+ cells phagocytosed zymosan, as shown by two-color flow cytometry and other immunofluorescence studies, and the zymosan-positive cells from kidney were able to initiate primary responses. Overall, these data demonstrate the existence of DC in kidneys and hearts, and suggest that in situ these cells resemble immature rather than mature DC.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","8133051",1994,"United States"
"Anthracycline antibiotics in cancer therapy. Focus on drug resistance.","30 years ago an anthracycline antibiotic was shown to have antineoplastic activity. This led to the development of well over 1000 analogues with a vast spectrum of biochemical characteristics. Many biological actions have been described. The original anthracyclines are active against many types of cancer and are an integral part of several curative combinations. They are ineffective against other tumours. Although some analogues show an altered spectrum of activity or an improved therapeutic index relative to the older agents, it is not clear that cardiotoxicity can be totally avoided with these agents. Primary and secondary resistance to anthracyclines remain major clinical problems. Pharmacokinetic studies have been of limited help in explaining this. Overexpression of a surface-membrane permeability glycoprotein (Pgp) was identified in ovarian cancer of patients who had clinical multidrug resistance in 1985. This led the way for the discovery of a number of resistance mechanisms in vitro. Some of these have been found in more than 1 type of cell line, and more than 1 mechanism may exist in a single cell. Additional resistance proteins have been identified, qualitative and quantitative alterations of topoisomerase II have been described, and some mechanisms in other systems have not yet been identified. Some of these may prove to be important in clinical drug resistance. Drugs such as calcium antagonists and cyclosporin, studied initially for their ability to block the Pgp pump, appear to be heterogeneous in this capacity and may have additional sites of action. It will be critical for clinical studies to define the precise resistance mechanism(s) that must be reversed. To date this has been difficult, even in trials ostensibly dealing with the original Pgp. Liposomes can potentially alter toxicity and target drug delivery to specific sites. In addition, they may permit the use of lipophilic drugs that would otherwise be difficult to administer systemically. Resistant tumours may be sensitive to anthracyclines delivered by liposomes. To reduce cardiac toxicity, administering doxorubicin (adriamycin) by slow infusion through a central-venous line should be considered whenever feasible. Monitoring of cardiac ejection fraction and the use of endomyocardial biopsy will permit patients to be treated safely after they reach the dose threshold at which heart failure begins to be a potential risk. A number of structurally modified anthracyclines with the potential advantages of decreased cardiotoxicity and avoidance of multidrug resistance mechanisms are entering clinical trials. Meanwhile, the vast weight of clinical experience leaves doxorubicin as a well tolerated and effective choice for most potentially anthracycline-sensitive tumours.","Drugs","7512899",1994,"New Zealand"
"In vitro immunogenicity of allogeneic cardiac valves.","The immunogenicity of allogeneic cardiac valves (ACV) has not been previously demonstrated in vitro, though valve failure due to tissue degeneration has been attributed to adverse immunological reactions. A novel in vitro assay has been developed in a Brown Norway (BN; RT1n)-Lewis (RT1; donor-recipient) rat model system that demonstrates the immunogenicity of ACVs. A single cell suspension of viable cardiac valve conduit (CVC) cells was obtained by collagenase treatment of BN rat aortic valve conduits. Brown Norway rat CVC cells (5 x 10(4)) and Lewis responder lymphocytes (10(5)) were co-cultured in 96 well plates in RPMI 1640 plus 2.5% (v/v) non heat-inactivated Lewis rat serum and supplements with appropriate controls. Stimulation of responder lymphocytes by CVC cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. The counts obtained between 96-192 h of co-culture in the CVC cell/responder lymphocyte reaction were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those of responder cell controls as assessed by analysis of variance. These results indicate the presence of potent immunostimulatory cells in viable ACVs and the possibility of using a sensitive and reproducible in vitro assay to evaluate ACV immunogenicity.","European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery","7826653",1994,"Germany"
"Biological properties of subpopulations of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells enriched by elutriation and flow cytometry.","We have studied several features of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (PHSCs) and day-12 spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) obtained from adult murine bone marrow. Single-cell suspensions of C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow were fractionated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation at flow rates (FR) of 15, 25, 30, and 35 ml/min, and with the rotor off (R/O). The fractions FR25 and FR35 contained approximately equal numbers of PHSC that could repopulate W/Wv mice. These PHSCs were further enriched by subtracting lineage-positive cells using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and magnetic immunobeads. The resulting lineage-negative cells (Lin-) were then stained with a MAb for the c-kit receptor and sorted by flow cytometry. Both subsets were fractionated into cells expressing high (bright) (c-kitBR), low (dull) c-kitDULL and no (negative, c-kitNEG) c-kit receptor. As few as 100 to 200 c-kitBR cells could repopulate the entire thymus and bone marrow in W/Wv mice. No PHSCs were present in the c-kitDULL and c-kitNEG fractions. We assayed fresh bone marrow and elutriation fractions FR25 and FR35 for gene expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Using a semiquantitative protocol, we detected mRNA for beta-globin and flk-2, a protein tyrosine kinase receptor, in all samples except the FR25 Lin- c-kitBR subset. We consider the cells in FR25 Lin- c-kitBR to be the most primitive set of hematopoietic stem cells.","Blood cells","7527675",1994,"United States"
"Microscopic conduction in cultured strands of neonatal rat heart cells measured with voltage-sensitive dyes.","Microscopic discontinuities in electrical activation were assessed in synthetic strands of neonatal rat myocytes cultured on a growth-directing matrix. An optical method using voltage-sensitive dye (RH-237) and a photodiode technique was used for recordings of membrane potential changes with subcellular resolution. Spatial resolution of the method (diameter of measurement area, 5.5 microns; interdiode distance, 30 microns) allowed for simultaneous measurements of cytoplasmic conduction time within a single cell and junctional conduction time across the cell border. In one-dimensional cell chains, where cells were juxtaposed by end-to-end connections but devoid of lateral connections, propagation of the excitation wave was strongly nonuniform: cytoplasmic conduction time was 38 +/- 30 (mean +/- SD) microseconds (n = 37), whereas junctional conduction time was 118 +/- 40 microseconds (n = 27, P &lt; .0001). A mean delay introduced by a single junction was 80 microseconds, or 51% of conduction time. In two-dimensional strands consisting of several cells in width, which exhibited lateral as well as end-to-end connections, inhomogeneity of conduction was smaller: the cytoplasmic and junctional conduction times were 57 +/- 30 (n = 46) and 89 +/- 40 (n = 48) microseconds, respectively (P &lt; .0001); mean junctional conduction delay was 32 microseconds (22% of conduction time). Mathematical modeling suggested that the averaging effect of lateral connections is caused by lateral convergence of local excitatory current beyond and lateral divergence before end-to-end connections. Our results demonstrate that the current flow through lateral cell-to-cell connections smooth the excitation wave front during longitudinal conduction in myocardial tissue.","Circulation research","8403261",1993,"United States"
"Vascular selectivity of seven prototype calcium antagonists: a study at the single cell level.","Vascular selective calcium antagonists (CAs) show an improved tolerance and a reduced incidence of adverse cardiac effects, especially in treatment of hypertension. The effects of seven well-known CAs on contractions of single isolated rat myocytes were studied and compared with their effects on stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5 cell line). In the latter test system, the order of potency to inhibit 45Ca2+ uptake was as follows (pIC25, -logM): isradipine (9.2), felodipine (8.7), nifedipine (8.5), nisoldipine (8.5), nicardipine (8.1), verapamil (6.7), and diltiazem (6.5). The potencies for inhibition of ventricular myocyte contraction at 0.5 Hz were (pIC25): isradipine (6.9), nisoldipine (6.7), felodipine (6.6), nicardipine (6.5), nifedipine (6.5), verapamil (5.3), and diltiazem (4.8). Thus, the order of vascular selectivity (i.e., the ratios of IC25 cardiocytes/IC25 A7r5 cells) was: isradipine (184), felodipine (128), nifedipine (107), nisoldipine (63), diltiazem (48), nicardipine (43), and verapamil (23). When ventricular cells were stimulated at 1 Hz, the order of selectivity was changed: Diltiazem was the least selective. Verapamil, diltiazem, and felodipine showed a highly frequency-dependent negative inotropic effect, whereas the effects of the other dihydropyridines were less affected by the frequency of stimulation. CAs show different degrees of vascular selectivity and different frequency-dependent profiles, and vascular selectivities are also dependent on experimental conditions. Selectivity is thus not necessarily related to chemical classes of drugs (e.g., dihydropyridines) or to different binding sites at the channel protein but could instead be due to varying dissociation rates from the respective binding sites at the channel in its different voltage-dependent states.","Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology","7506331",1993,"United States"
"Continuous measurements of cytoplasmic ATP in single cardiomyocytes during simulation of the &quot;oxygen paradox&quot;.","OBJECTIVE: It is now possible to monitor cytoplasmic ATP in single cardiomyocytes and it has recently been shown that cardiomyocytes exposed for several minutes to metabolic inhibitors undergo an abrupt rigor mediated shortening which coincides with a sudden fall in cytoplasmic ATP, from approximately 150 mumol.litre-1 to a few micromolar or less. The objective of this work was to monitor cytoplasmic ATP during simulated reoxygenation of a poisoned cardiomyocyte.METHODS: Firefly luciferase was injected into a single cell and the light signal generated when luciferin was superfused was monitored. Calibration of the signal is complicated by a transient enhancement of the signal (possibly the result of complex luciferase kinetics), and by uncertainties about cytoplasmic pH.RESULTS: The data indicate that millimolar levels of cytoplasmic ATP are restored within 1-2 min of cyanide removal.CONCLUSIONS: Cytoplasmic free calcium is known to rise after poisoned cells undergo shortening, so it is conceivable that the restoration of cytoplasmic ATP in a cell in which free calcium is at micromolar levels may provide a plausible cellular mechanism for the &quot;oxygen paradox&quot;. Reoxygenation induces large amplitude, but slow, oscillations in free calcium which, together with the millimolar levels of ATP indicated here, could provide the stimuli for generating the uncoordinated mechanical forces that are prevalent in the oxygen paradox.","Cardiovascular research","8275532",1993,"England"
"[Ion-selective microelectrodes for intracellular measurements].","Ion-selective electrodes have been used for many years to analyze ion activities in electrolyte solutions. In recent years, these electrodes have been miniaturized and applied for measurements in the cell interior. This article describes basic principles for both the fabrication and the intracellular application of ion-selective microelectrodes, particularly focusing on double barreled liquid ion-exchanger microelectrodes. The use of ion-selective microelectrodes allows continuous and real-time measurements of intracellular ion activities of a single cell in both multicellular and isolated cell preparations under various conditions, such as changes in ion composition of the extracellular bathing fluid and exposure to certain drugs. With double-barreled ion-selective microelectrodes, the transmembrane potential and intracellular ion activities can be measured simultaneously in the same cell. Although there are still some problems or limitations to the intracellular application of ion-selective electrodes, this technique is useful for determining the actual movement of intracellular ions, and thereby to elucidate cellular mechanisms of membrane transport and other physiological functions.","Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

"Cardiovascular development in the zebrafish. I. Myocardial fate map and heart tube formation.","We have analyzed the origin of cardiac progenitors in the zebrafish embryo by injection of single blastomeres with a lineage tracer dye, and examined the formation of the zebrafish heart tube by serial sectioning of immunostained embryos. At the 512-cell stage (early blastula), most cardiac progenitors lie in a marginal zone that extends from 90 degrees longitude (midway between the future dorsal and ventral axis) through 180 degrees longitude (the future ventral axis) to 270 degrees longitude. By focusing on myocardial progenitors located at 90 degrees (and 270 degrees) longitude, we found that a single cell injected in the early blastula can contribute progeny to both the atrium and ventricle. A cell injected in the midblastula contributes progeny to either the atrium or ventricle, but not both. This analysis suggests that, at least for these myocardial progenitors, the atrial and ventricular lineages separate in the midblastula. Precardiac cells involute early during gastrulation and turn towards the animal pole with other early involuting cells. These cardiogenic cells reach the embryonic axis around the 8-somite stage, and there they coalesce to form a pair of myocardial tubular primordia on either side of the midline. By the 21-somite stage, the tropomyosin-immunoreactive myocardial tubes have moved closer to each other, and a distinct group of cells, the endocardial progenitor cells, sits medially between them. The myocardial tubes then fuse to enclose the endocardial cells and form the definitive heart tube. By 22 hours postfertilization (26-somite stage), the heart tube is clearly beating. The regionalization of cardiac myosin heavy chain expression distinguishes the cardiac chambers at this stage, although they are not morphologically delineated until 36 hours. This work shows that cardiogenic regions can be identified in the early blastula, and that chamber restriction seems to arise in the midblastula. Additionally, it provides the basis for embryological perturbation at the single cell level, as well as for the genetic analysis of heart tube formation in the zebrafish.","Development (Cambridge, England)","8275863",1993,"United States"
"Impairment of myocyte contractility following coronary artery narrowing is associated with activation of the myocyte IGF1 autocrine system, enhanced expression of late growth related genes, DNA synthesis, and myocyte nuclear mitotic division in rats.","To determine whether the alterations in ventricular loading and myocyte cellular contractile performance produced by short-term coronary artery constriction were associated with the activation of genes implicated in myocyte DNA synthesis including changes in the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (IGF1-R), nonocclusive coronary artery narrowing (CAN) was induced in rats. Animals were examined 2 and 7 days after coronary constriction. Following the in vivo documentation of severe impairment of ventricular performance, estimations of single-cell mechanics in vitro showed that peak shortening was decreased in left and right myocytes of coronary stenosed rats. Moreover, time to peak shortening was prolonged whereas velocity of shortening was decreased. These defects in myocyte contractility were accompanied by increases in cell length and width, indicative of myocyte enlargement biventricularly. In addition, CAN led to an enhanced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and histone-H3 genes in myocytes at 2 and 7 days after surgery. PCNA protein was also detected in these stressed cells. These molecular responses were associated with increases in mRNA for IGF1 and IGF1-R in combination with enhanced DNA synthesis and appearance of myocyte nuclear mitotic division. In conclusion, cardiac myocytes may respond to the elevation in wall and myocyte stress by activating an IGF1-IGF1-R autocrine system which may modulate the induction of late growth related genes which are essential for DNA replication and myocyte cellular hyperplasia.","Experimental cell research","8102103",1993,"United States"
"Ultrastructure of the cardiac and pyloric glands of the gastric mucosa of the South African hedgehog, Atelerix frontalis.","The cardiac and pyloric glands in the gastric mucosa of the South African hedgehog, Atelerix frontalis, are described. The cardiac area of the stomach contains proper cardiac glands and lacks undifferentiated fundic glands. The cardiac glands are simple tubular, coiled, and lined with columnar cells ultrastructurally similar to those of the gastric surface epithelium. Secretory granules with varying electron densities fill the apical cytoplasm of these cells. In contrast to other mammals, these glands lack mucous neck cells. The neck of the pyloric glands contains only a single cell type, whereas the basal regions of these glands contain &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; cells. The secretory granules in the &quot;dark&quot; cells and the pyloric neck cells have a moderate electron density and often contain an electron dense core. An electron-lucent cytoplasm with numerous polysomes is characteristic of the &quot;light&quot; cells. Some &quot;light&quot; cells contain electron-dense granules in the apical cytoplasm. The presence of only neutral mucins in the cardiac gland cells denotes the absence of mucous neck cells. The acidic mucins within the pyloric neck cells seem to indicate that these cells are mucous neck cells, whereas the neutral mucins within the basally located pyloric gland cells show at least a partial functional difference from the pyloric neck cells. <U+00A9> 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Journal of morphology","29865432",1993,"United States"
"Regulation of angiotensin II receptors on ventricular myocytes after myocardial infarction in rats.","To determine the effects of acute myocardial infarction on the regulation of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors and contractile performance of left and right ventricular myocytes, coronary artery ligation was surgically induced in rats, and Ang II receptor density and affinity and the mechanical properties of surviving muscle cells were examined 1 week later. Physiological determinations of cardiac pump function revealed the presence of ventricular failure, which was associated at the cellular level with a depression in the velocity of myocyte shortening and relengthening, a prolongation of time to peak shortening, and a reduction in the extent of cell shortening. These abnormalities in single-cell function were more prominent in left than in right ventricular myocytes. Cellular hypertrophy was documented by increases in cell length and width, which were also greater in the spared myocytes of the infarcted left ventricle. Reactive hypertrophy was accompanied by a 1.84- and 1.85-fold increase in the density of Ang II receptors on left and right myocytes, respectively. On the other hand, the affinity of Ang II receptors for the radiolabeled antagonist was not altered. However, Ang II-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover was enhanced by 3.7- and 2.5-fold in left and right myocytes, respectively, after infarction. Ventricular myocytes were found to possess the AT1 receptor subtype exclusively. In conclusion, myocardial infarction leads to impairment in the contractile behavior of the remaining cells and to the activation of Ang II receptors and effector pathway associated with these receptors, which may be involved in the reactive growth adaptation of the viable myocytes.","Circulation research","8495545",1993,"United States"
"Geographical mapping of metabolites in biological tissue with quantitative bioluminescence and single photon imaging.","This article features a novel technique for measuring the spatial distribution of metabolites, such as ATP, glucose, and lactate, in rapidly frozen tissue. Concentration values are obtained in absolute terms and with a spatial resolution of single-cell dimension. The method is based on enzymatic reactions that link the metabolite of interest to luciferase with subsequent light emission. Using a specific array, cryosections are brought into contact with the enzymes in a well-defined, reproducible way inducing a distribution of light across the section with an intensity that is proportional to the metabolite concentration. The emitted light can be visualized through a microscope and an imaging photon counting system, and the respective image can be transferred to a computer for image analysis. Measurements in spherical cell aggregates with central necrosis demonstrate a close correlation between the distribution of ATP and of cellular viability at a microregional level. Similarly, ATP and glucose are correlated with the geometrical arrangement of more viable and more necrotic tissue regions in human melanomas xenografted in nude mice. Lactate did not show such a structure-related distribution in these tumours. Structure-related distributions of ATP, glucose, and lactate are found in cervix tumours of patients. In contrast to the heterogeneous distributions in tumours, the distribution patterns were much more homogeneous in normal tissues. Regional differences were present, but were much more gradual than in malignancies. This was illustrated for heart muscle where ATP concentrations were found that agreed with data in the literature, and that showed a decrease in periventricular areas.","The Histochemical journal","7689547",1993,"Netherlands"
"Increased calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum stimulated by inositol trisphosphate in spontaneously hypertensive rat heart cells.","It is known that inositol (1, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (IP3) stimulates Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in several tissues, but in cardiac myocytes this phenomenon has not been confirmed. The purpose of the present study was to confirm the effect of (1, 4, 5)-IP3 on Ca2+ release from SR in cardiac myocytes. The effect of IP3 on Ca2+ release from SR in hypertrophic cardiac cells was also determined. We examined the effects of IP3 on Ca2+ release from cardiac myocyte SR by the digital-image method in a single cell. We also determined the effect of IP3 on calcium release from isolated SR. SR was prepared from spontaneous hypertensive rat hearts and Wistar kyoto rat hearts. The SR was prelabeled with 45Ca2+, and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of IP3 for 1 min at 37 degrees C. In cardiac myocytes treated with saponin, Ca2+ release stimulated by 10 microM (1, 4, 5)-IP3 was detected by fura-2. In 45Ca2+ prelabeled SR, the maximal Ca2+ release was achieved at 10 microM IP3 incubated for 1 min. The release of Ca2+ was higher in SR of SHR than in the SR of WKY. IP3 stimulates Ca2-release from cardiac SR, and this release is greater in SHR than in WKY. However, it is uncertain whether this phenomenon plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy.","Molecular and cellular biochemistry","8455586",1993,"Netherlands"
"An update of the stereology of the myocyte of the baboon's heart: analysis of the crista terminalis, interatrial and interventricular septa, and atrioventricular bundle.","We used light microscopy to compare the stereology of the myocytes from the following regions of the baboon's heart: a) cardiac walls (crista terminalis, interatrial and interventricular septa) and b) cardiac conduction tissue (atrioventricular bundle). Six hearts were perfused and several pieces of tissue were taken from these regions. A staggered test lattice consisting of cycloids was superimposed on twelve random pairs of photomicrographs in order to make disectors, and on twelve other random fields for each cardiac region in order to estimate certain stereological parameters. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing the number of myocytes from the crista terminalis (highest value) with either the interatrial or interventricular septum. There is also a significant difference between the number of myocytes in the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular bundle (highest value). For the mean profile area of the myocytes, significant differences were found between the myocytes of both the crista terminalis and the interatrial septum, and those of the interventricular septum (highest value). Under the light microscope, myocytes from the two regions of the atrial wall studied were indistinguishable in size, since they constitute a single cell population. It was also impossible to distinguish them from the atrioventricular cells.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that isoproterenol reverses the sodium channel blocking effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs through modulation of INa. The experiments were performed in rabbit ventricular myocytes using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. Reversal of lidocaine suppression of INa by isoproterenol (1 microM) was significant at various concentrations of lidocaine (20, 65, and 100 microM, P &lt; 0.05). The effects of isoproterenol were voltage dependent, showing reversal of INa suppression by lidocaine at normal and hyperpolarized potentials (negative to -80 mV) but not at depolarized potentials. Isoproterenol enhanced sodium channel availability but did not alter the steady state activation or inactivation of INa nor did it improve sodium channel recovery in the presence of lidocaine. The physiological significance of the single cell INa findings were corroborated by measurements of conduction velocities using an epicardial mapping system in isolated rabbit hearts. Lidocaine (10 microM) significantly suppressed epicardial impulse conduction in both longitudinal (theta L, 0.430 +/- 0.024 vs. 0.585 +/- 0.001 m/s at baseline, n = 7, P &lt; 0.001) and transverse (theta T, 0.206 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.257 +/- 0.014 m/s at baseline, n = 8, P &lt; 0.001) directions. Isoproterenol (0.05 microM) significantly reversed the lidocaine effects with theta L of 0.503 +/- 0.027 m/s and theta T of 0.234 +/- 0.015 m/s (P = 0.014 and 0.004 compared with the respective lidocaine measurements). These results suggest that enhancement of INa is an important mechanism by which isoproterenol reverses the effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.","The Journal of clinical investigation","8381826",1993,"United States"
"Levels of angiotensin and molecular biology of the tissue renin angiotensin systems.","The cloning of renin, angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme genes have established a widespread presence of these components of the renin-angiotensin system in multiple tissues. New sites of gene expression and peptide products in different tissues has provided strong evidence for the production of angiotensin independently of the endocrine blood borne system. In addition, the cloning of the angiotensin receptor (AT1) gene has confirmed the widespread distribution of angiotensin and suggested new functions for the peptide. This review of various tissues shows the variation in gene expression between tissues and angiotensin levels, and the fragmentary state of our knowledge in this area. As yet we cannot state that the gene expression of the substrates, enzymes and peptide products are involved in a single cell synthesis. This is not so much evidence against a paracrine function for tissue angiotensin, as lack of detailed, accurate intracellular information. The low abundance of renin in brain, spleen, lung and thymus compared to kidney, adrenal, heart, testes, and submandibular gland may suggest that there are both tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) and nonrenin-angiotensin systems (NRAS). The NRAS could function through cleavage of angiotensinogen by serine proteinases such as tonin and cathepsin G to form Ang II directly. Although much angiotensinogen is extracellular and could therefore be a site of synthesis outside of the cell, intracellular angiotensinogen in a NRAS process could produce Ang II intracellularly without requiring extracellular conversion of Ang I to Ang II by ACE. In summary, renin mRNA is found in high concentrations in kidney, adrenal and testes and decreasing lower concentrations in ovary, liver, brain, spleen, lung and thymus. Angiotensinogen mRNA is found in the following tissues in descending order of abundance: liver, fat cells, brain (glial cells), kidney, ovary, adrenal gland, heart, lung, large intestine and stomach. It is debatable whether angiotensinogen and renin mRNA are expressed in blood vessels. The evidence that is lacking for a paracrine function of angiotensin is a complete description of the intracellular molecular synthesis and release of Ang II from single cells of promising tissues. Such tissues, SMG, ovary, testes, adrenal, pituitary and brain (neurons and glia) are potent sources of RAS components for future studies. Although the evidence for a paracrine function of angiotensin II is incomplete, it is an important concept for progressing toward the understanding of tissue peptide physiology and the significance of their gene regulation.","Regulatory peptides","8426906",1993,"Netherlands"
"Modulation of invasive potential in different clonal subpopulations of a rat rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (BA-HAN-1) by differentiation induction.","Three clonal subpopulations (A, B, C) isolated from the same rhabdomyosarcoma of the rat and differing in their degree of spontaneous differentiation were tested for their invasive potential before and after differentiation induction with retinoic acid (RA), N-monomethylformamide (NMF) and sodium butyrate (NaBut). Invasive potential was analysed in an in vitro assay using embryonic chick heart fragments in organotypic culture. In standard culture medium, all three subpopulations were shown to be invasive, progressively replacing the chick heart fragments within 7-11 days after confrontation. After exposure to RA, NMF or NaBut, marked differences in the invasive potential of these subpopulations were, however, observed. Subpopulation C exhibited a pronounced decline in invasive potential, as evidenced by a significant decrease (P = 0.005) in the proportion of chick heart fragments with advanced stages of invasion. This response, however, was confined to the differentiation-inducing agents RA and NaBut, which had also produced a marked increase in morphological and/or biochemical differentiation (P = 0.0001). In contrast, NMF, which had only minor effects on differentiation, failed to affect the invasive potential of subpopulation C. In subpopulation B, a transient inhibition of single cell invasion became evident after exposure to RA, whereas NMF and NaBut failed to affect the invasive potential in spite of minor effects on differentiation. In the least differentiated subpopulation A, which was shown to be refractory to the differentiation-inducing effects of RA, NMF and NaBut, there was also no observation of any reduction of invasive potential. The results of our study demonstrate that differentiation-inducing agents can significantly reduce the invasive potential of malignant tumors, although marked differences of response are to be expected between the different subpopulations of a tumor.","Clinical &amp; experimental metastasis","8422707",1993,"Netherlands"
"Transformed growth phenotype of mouse mammary epithelium in primary culture induced by specific fetal mesenchymes.","When mesenchyme from fetal mammary or salivary gland is implanted into adult mouse mammary gland, adjacent epithelium responds with intense hyperplasia. The hyperplastic cells are more vulnerable than are non-stimulated cells to transformation in vivo by a chemical carcinogen or by mammary tumor virus. This system provides a potentially useful model for determining how stroma contributes to mammary tumorigenesis. We have developed co-culture systems and used them to investigate in more detail the nature of the signal produced by the mesenchyme cells. Monolayers of mesenchyme cells were prepared on tissue-culture wells. The mesenchyme cells were trapped on the surface by a thin overlay of agarose. Primary mammary epithelial cells were cultured atop this barrier layer, either as organoids in collagen gels for assessment of anchorage-dependent growth, or as single-cell dispersions in soft agarose for assessment of anchorage-independent growth. Our procedures for assay of anchorage-independent growth allow us for the first time to detect and measure this transformation-defining characteristic in non-immortalized mammary epithelial cells in primary culture. Fetal mammary fat pad precursor tissue and fetal salivary mesenchyme both stimulated anchorage-dependent growth of mammary epithelium, with cell number increasing as much as fifteenfold during a 6-day culture period. These same fetal tissues also stimulated anchorage-independent growth of the mammary epithelial cells, with colony-forming efficiencies of up to 40% in co-cultures with salivary mesenchyme. No colonies formed in the absence of mesenchyme. Cells of colonies contained keratin, which indicates that the colonies grew from epithelial cells and not from a contaminant of another cell type. When co-cultured epithelial cells were subsequently re-cultured in the absence of mesenchyme, they lost their ability to grow independent of anchorage. No colonies grew in co-cultures with fetal cells from heart, kidney, or lung, which is consistent with the lack of stimulation by these tissues in the mammary gland in vivo. A tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA), also caused anchorage-independent growth of the dispersed mammary epithelial cells. Culture medium conditioned by primary or early-passage salivary mesenchyme cells was capable of stimulating growth under both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent conditions, confirming that these effects are mediated by a paracrine factor. The results indicate that stimulatory fetal mesenchymes produce soluble molecules that act analogously to transforming growth factors.","Journal of cellular physiology","1429857",1992,"United States"
"The impact of single cell voltage clamp on the understanding of the cardiac ventricular action potential.","In this article we review results obtained during the last decade by the single cell voltage clamp technique on cardiac ventricular myocytes, and we re-evaluate the major ionic currents underlying the cardiac action potential. Since its introduction into cardiac electrophysiology in the late seventies this technique has greatly contributed to our knowledge about the role of the transmembrane ionic currents in the heart. Recent findings gained with this method have confirmed that the inward sodium current is responsible not only for the fast depolarization, but, in part, also for the maintenance of the plateau phase of the action potential. The kinetics of the inward calcium current measured by the single cell voltage clamp technique proved to be much faster than was previously thought. In addition, two types of the inward calcium current with different physiological roles have recently been identified. The L-type calcium current plays an important part in maintaining the plateau phase of the action potential and may cause depolarization at less negative potentials. Although the physiological significance of the T-type calcium current is less clear, it appears to be involved in the pacemaker function of cardiac tissues. Single cell voltage clamp experiments have shown that the inward rectifier potassium current is not independent of time, as described earlier, but it helps to terminate the final phase of repolarization, and presumably controls the resting membrane potential. Recent studies with the single cell voltage clamp method have revealed that the delayed rectifier potassium current has, most probably, more than one component and is extensively modulated by neurotransmitters. Its main role is to initiate and terminate cardiac repolarization. This current is of particular importance in regulating rate-dependent repolarizations. The transient outward current, which rapidly activates and inactivates after depolarization, initiates early fast repolarization and may also take part in rate-dependent repolarization. The ionic carriers of this current are most likely potassium and chloride. The use of the single cell voltage clamp technique has led to the discovery of formerly unrecognized currents, like the ATP-dependent potassium current, the sodium activated potassium current and the chloride currents. The application of the new technique has made it possible to focus more attention on currents which were difficult to study previously, such as Na/K pump and Na/Ca exchanger currents.","Cardioscience","1384746",1992,"Italy"
"Subcellular electrolyte alterations during progressive hypoxia and following reoxygenation in isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.","This study characterizes the sequential alterations of, and relations between, multiple electrolytes in cytoplasm, mitochondria, and whole cells during hypoxia and on reoxygenation in isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Subcellular electrolyte content and distribution were measured by electron probe x-ray microanalysis, membrane phospholipid degradation by tritiated arachidonic acid release, and cell morphology by electron microscopy. At 1-2 hours of hypoxia, the myocyte population showed a loss of cytoplasmic potassium, magnesium, and chlorine without alteration of cytoplasmic sodium or calcium. Mitochondria showed increased potassium with unchanged magnesium content. There was no morphological evidence of cell injury or tritiated arachidonic acid release. At 3-5 hours of hypoxia, the myocyte population showed a further loss of cytoplasmic potassium and magnesium and an increase in cytoplasmic sodium, chlorine, and calcium. At a single-cell level, the increase in cytoplasmic sodium preceded the increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Mitochondria showed increased sodium and chlorine and decreased magnesium before increased calcium content; potassium loss was manifest only at 5 hours of hypoxia. At 3-5 hours of hypoxia, there was also tritiated arachidonic acid release and morphological evidence of cell injury. Reoxygenation for 1 hour after 5 hours of hypoxia partially reversed the mean alterations of all electrolytes, except calcium, in the cytoplasm of the myocyte population, whereas analysis was required at a single-cell level to show a partial reversal in calcium levels in cytoplasm of reoxygenated cells. Reoxygenation for 1 hour after 5 hours of hypoxia partially reversed the mean alterations of all electrolytes, including calcium, in the mitochondria of the myocyte population. Recovery of potassium in the cytoplasm correlated with reduction of mitochondrial calcium content on reoxygenation and best predicted recovery of cellular homeostasis of sodium, chlorine, magnesium, and calcium. This study demonstrates that in this experimental model of hypoxia 1) initial losses of cytoplasmic potassium and magnesium occur in the absence of cell injury; 2) increases of sodium, chlorine, and calcium occur in association with cell injury, with sodium increasing before calcium; 3) membrane phospholipid degradation and electrolyte derangement, including increased calcium, may contribute to reversible and irreversible phases of cell injury; 4) analysis of calcium at a subcompartmental level and at a single-cell level is required to correlate reduction of calcium on reoxygenation with recovery of cell homeostasis; 5) reduction of calcium content in mitochondria may predict recovery of cell homeostasis; and 6) recovery of potassium on reoxygenation best predicts recovery of cell membrane function and cell homeostasis.","Circulation research","1606659",1992,"United States"
"Microinjection of antibodies and expression vectors into living myocardial cells. Development of a novel approach to identify candidate genes that regulate cardiac growth and hypertrophy.","BACKGROUND: Microinjection approaches in the cardiac cell context have allowed delivery of various calcium dyes and monitoring of short-term physiological responses. However, unlike other cell types, it has proved difficult to microinject myocardial cells without the concomitant loss of long-term cell viability.METHODS AND RESULTS: An analysis of experimental variables was conducted to adapt microinjection techniques to the neonatal rat ventricular cell context. Among the variables optimized were the selection of culture dishes, plating substrate, microinjection parameters, and a variety of maneuvers to inhibit myocyte hypercontracture, injury, and consequent death after micropuncture. With the modified technique, the percentage of injected cells that maintained long-term viability (48 hours) increased from less than 1% to 30%. Similarly, an increased efficiency of gene transfer and expression (measured as the percentage of injected cells that express the delivered gene) was obtained after either cytoplasmic or nuclear injection of a beta-galactosidase expression vector into cardiac myocytes. Microinjection of marker immunoglobulin G does not interfere with the induction of the hypertrophic response or the expression of a coinjected atrial natriuretic factor promoter-luciferase reporter fusion gene construct.CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first description of the efficient microinjection of neonatal cardiac muscle cells with maintenance of long-term cell viability. The microinjection technique is now a viable approach to examine cause-and-effect relations between specific gene products and any defined feature or response of cardiac myocytes that can be assayed at a single-cell level.","Circulation","1534288",1992,"United States"
"Isolated ventricular myocytes from failing and non-failing human heart; the relation of age and clinical status of patients to isoproterenol response.","Single cardiac myocytes were isolated from the ventricles of failing and non-failing human hearts. The contraction amplitude, time-to-peak shortening and time to 50% and 90% relaxation were measured in cells stimulated at 0.2 Hz at 32 degrees C. The effects of increasing extracellular calcium and isoproterenol were investigated using cumulative concentration/response curves. Maximum contraction amplitude in high calcium or velocities of contraction or relaxation were not impaired in cells from failing hearts. Beta-adrenoceptor function in a single cell was assessed by the maximum contraction amplitude in the presence of isoproterenol relative to that with high calcium in the same cell (isoproterenol/calcium ratio). A decrease in the isoproterenol/calcium ratio correlated positively with an increase in the isoproterenol EC50 (concentration for half-maximal effect) for a cell (P less than 0.02, n = 39). The isoproterenol/calcium ratio in left ventricular myocytes decreased with increasing severity of disease, correlating with failure as defined by New York Heart Association class (P less than 0.001, n = 26 patients), left ventricular ejection fraction (P less than 0.001, n = 24), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (P less than 0.05, n = 21) and amount of diuretics prescribed (P less than 0.001, n = 26). In right ventricular myocytes, only increasing NYHA class correlated with decreasing isoproterenol/calcium ratios. There was a correlation of the isoproterenol/calcium ratio between right and left ventricular cells from patients with ischemic heart disease (P less than 0.05), n = 11). Beta-adrenoceptor subsensitivity occurred in mitral valve disease, ischemic heart disease, congenital abnormalities and congestive cardiomyopathy, but not in the right ventricle of patients with myocarditis. The isoproterenol/calcium ratio correlated negatively with the age of the patient (P less than 0.001, n = 26, left ventricle). Multiple regression indicated that the maximum contraction amplitudes in either high isoproterenol or high calcium declined significantly with age only, but that both age and severity of disease contributed to the decrease in isoproterenol/calcium ratio. Time-to-peak tension in isoproterenol, as well as relaxation times in high calcium also decreased with the age of the patient. Analysis of variance showed that between-patient variation was significantly greater than between-cell for most of the parameters measured. Beta-adrenoceptor desensitisation may be detected in individual myocytes from failing hearts, and this relates more to the severity of disease and the age of the patient rather than the etiology of heart failure. A decline in absolute contractility of muscle cells with age was detected.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","1321914",1992,"England"
"Molecular cloning and expression of rat connexin40, a gap junction protein expressed in vascular smooth muscle.","Gap junctions contain intercellular channels which are formed by members of a group of related proteins called connexins. Connexins contain conserved transmembrane and extracellular domains, but unique cytoplasmic regions which may provide connexin-specific physiologic properties. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and cDNA library screening to clone DNA encoding a novel member of this gene family, rat connexin40 (Cx40). The derived rat Cx40 polypeptide contains 356 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 40,233 Da. Sequence comparisons suggest that Cx40 is the mammalian homologue of chick connexin42, but it has predicted cytoplasmic regions that differ from previously described mammalian connexins. Southern blots of rat genomic DNA suggest that Cx40 is encoded by a single copy gene containing no introns within its coding region. Northern blots demonstrate that Cx40 is expressed in multiple tissues (including lung, heart, uterus, ovary, and blood vessels) and in primary cultures and established lines of vascular smooth muscle cells. Cx40 is coexpressed with connexin43 in several cell types, including A7r5 cells, which contain two physiologically distinct gap junctional channels. To demonstrate that Cx40 could form functional channels, we stably transfected communication-deficient Neuro2A cells with Cx40 DNA. These Cx40-transfected cells showed intercellular passage of microinjected Lucifer yellow CH. The expression of multiple connexins (such as Cx40 and Cx43) by a single cell may provide a mechanism by which cells regulate intercellular coupling through the formation of multiple channels.","The Journal of membrane biology","1328644",1992,"United States"
"Spontaneous and propagated calcium release in isolated cardiac myocytes viewed by confocal microscopy.","Laser scanning confocal microscopy of the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorophore fluo-3 has been used to investigate spontaneous and propagated calcium release at high temporal and spatial resolution in enzymatically dispersed rat cardiomyocytes. Waves of fluorescence which propagated throughout the cytosol were evident in spontaneously contracting cardiac cells containing fluo-3, but not in cells containing Ca(2+)-insensitive fluorophores [2',7'-bis (carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, SNARF-1, rhodamine-123, or tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextran]. These waves represent localized areas of elevated [Ca2+] [975 +/- 13 (SE) nM, range 800-1,500 nM; n = 16 cells]. Ca2+ waves were initiated by the spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and propagated through cells at rates of 50-150 microns/s. Ca2+ waves were usually initiated at the cell ends, but multiple and variable initiation foci were observed in some cells. Where waves intersected within a single cell there was extinction of wave propagation, confirming the SR as the direct source of Ca2+ and revealing a refractory period in SR Ca2+ release. In some cells high-frequency Ca2+ waves lead to synchronized elevation of [Ca2+] throughout the entire cytosol and within the time period associated with cell depolarization. These observations support the hypothesis that some cardiac arrhythmias are initiated by spontaneous and propagated Ca2+ release and involve subsequent depolarization, global elevation of intracellular [Ca2+], and cell contraction.","The American journal of physiology","1550213",1992,"United States"
"Abnormal electrical properties of myocytes from chronically infarcted canine heart. Alterations in Vmax and the transient outward current.","BACKGROUND: Reentrant ventricular arrhythmias can occur in the surviving muscle fibers of the epicardial border zone of the canine heart 5 days after coronary artery occlusion. To understand the cellular basis of these arrhythmias, we developed a method of dispersing myocytes (IZs) from the epicardial border zone.METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the electrophysiological properties of IZs with those of cells dispersed from the epicardium of control noninfarcted (NZs) and of sham-operated animals (NZsham). Transmembrane action potentials of IZs are reduced in total action potential amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity compared with NZs. However, resting potential of IZs is no different from that of NZs. Action potential duration at -10 mV is significantly reduced in IZs compared with control, and IZ potentials do not show the typical &quot;spike and dome&quot; morphology that is evident in all NZs. Using Vmax as an indirect measure of the peak inward current available for the upstroke of the action potential, we found that the availability curve for IZs is significantly different from the NZ curve. Furthermore, the time course of recovery of Vmax after a depolarizing voltage clamp step was significantly altered in IZs. Using whole-cell voltage clamp techniques, we determined that the voltage-dependent, Ca(2+)-independent, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (ito1) occurred in all NZs (n = 16) but existed in only 37% of IZs (n = 16). There was a significant reduction in the density of ito1 elicited by depolarizing steps in those IZs showing ito1 compared with ito1 density in NZs.CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a single-cell model of cells that survive in the infarcted heart. Our studies indicate that there are changes in Vmax in IZs. In addition, there is no prominent phase 1 of repolarization in IZ action potentials. This is consistent with the dramatic loss in the function of the ionic channel responsible for the voltage-dependent transient outward current, ito1.","Circulation","1371431",1992,"United States"
"Clonal analysis of cardiac morphogenesis in the chicken embryo using a replication-defective retrovirus: I. Formation of the ventricular myocardium.","Cells of the precardiac mesoderm (stages 4-6) and dividing myocytes of early hearts (stages 10-15) were tagged with a replication-incompetent retrovirus (CXL) (Mikawa et al., 1991b) encoding bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). Two protocols were used to infect the cardiogenic cells. (1) Small blocks (approximately 50 micron 2) of anterolateral mesoderm were dissected from gastrula-stage embryos (stages 4-6) and incubated in liquid medium containing the retrovirus. After removal of CXL, the tissues were dispersed into single-cell suspensions and pressure injected into the precardiac areas of recipient embryos (stages 4-6). Such embryos were then incubated in vitro at 37 degrees C for 2 days (New, 1968), and those embryos with beating hearts were fixed for X-gal histochemistry and paraffin serial sectioning. (2) CXL was pressure injected in ovo (embryonic stages 4-15) into cardiogenic tissues and the eggs subsequently returned to an incubator. At selected stages of development embryos or whole hearts were fixed, stained with X-gal, and serially sectioned after paraffin embedding. The first method showed that (1) cells of the precardiac mesoderm could be infected with the retrovirus, (2) the transplanted cells would differentiate into beating myocytes, and (3) beta-gal expression was sufficiently high to be detected histochemically. With the second procedure we could show that (1) beta-gal-tagged cells formed colonies in the myocardium, (2) the labeled cells were exclusively myocytes, (3) the number of cells per colony increased with increasing age of embryonic development, (4) the size of colonies was larger in the left than the right ventricle, (5) many of the colonies were transmural, i.e., they extended from epicardial to endocardial layers of the myocardium and generally exhibited a cone or funnel-shape with the base of the cone nearest the epicardium, (6) the orientation of myocytes within each colony changed at different layers of the myocardium, and (7) the cones contained both beta-gal+ and beta-gal- myocytes. DNA labeling studies with [3H]thymidine indicated that cardiogenic cells divided every 16-18 hr during the first week of development and that the CXL-labeled cells divided indistinguishably from unlabeled myocytes. Based on these observations a model for the growth of the myocardium is presented.","Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","1540702",1992,"United States"

Single doses caused no discernible pathological changes. Damage to the capillaries was followed by prominent effusion of serum and erythrocytes into the interstitial spaces of the myocardium occurred. Swelling of the endothelial lining cells of capillaries caused narrowing of the lumen and accumulation of blood platelets in capillaries, which resulted in multiple single cell necroses of cardiac muscle cells. Within 1 month after the treatments of these phycotoxins, myocytes and capillaries appeared to be normal. Effusion in the interstitial spaces resulted in formation of bundles of dense collagen, which persisted for 14 months. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis was prominent in septum and ventricles, accompanied by bilateral ventricular hypertrophy. A single dose of 0.7 micrograms/kg ip resulted in severe acute heart injuries, followed by diffuse myocardial fibrosis.","Natural toxins","1344895",1992,"United States"
"A model analysis for competitive binding of mexiletine and aprindine to the cardiac sodium channel.","A simulation model was developed to predict complex interaction between antiarrhythmic drugs and cardiac sodium channels. This model has four assumptions: (1) Vmax of the action potential is a linear indicator of available sodium channel conductance; (2) antiarrhythmic drugs block the channel by binding to a single common receptor site associated with the channel; (3) binding and dissociation rate constants differ for the three channel states: activated, inactivated and resting, and (4) both drug-free and drug-bound channels change states far more rapidly than binding and dissociation processes. Binding and dissociation rate constants for the three channel states were calculated from single cell experiments using guinea pig hearts. Vmax changes reflecting tonic and use-dependent sodium channel block in the presence of mexiletine and aprindine were simulated and compared with those obtained in the single cell experiments. The model predicted that 'tonic' Vmax inhibition would be enhanced, whereas 'use-dependent' ones would be attenuated after admixture of mexiletine with aprindine. The mechanisms would involve competitive interaction at the common receptor site. Single-cell experiments supported this prediction. We conclude that our simple two-drug binding model provides a useful tool to predict pharmacological interaction between class I antiarrhythmic drugs given in combination.","Pharmacology","1320276",1992,"Switzerland"

Junctional conductance was reversibly reduced by 2 mM halothane, 1 mM heptanol and 100% CO2 and was increased by 1 mM 8 Br-cAMP. Two gap junction proteins, connexin 26 and connexin 43, were identified between leptomeningeal cells using immunocytochemical methods; Northern blot analyses of RNA isolated from cultured leptomeningeal cells showed specific hybridization to cDNAs encoding connexins 26 and 43, but not to a cDNA encoding connexin 32.

Cells were studied in the presence of 0, 10(-5) M, or 10(-4) M ketamine. Peak baseline calcium current was similar in all three groups (911 +/- 92 pA, 954 +/- 66 pA, and 962 +/- 54 pA, respectively). During exposure to ketamine, peak calcium current was unchanged in the no-ketamine control group (886 +/- 74 pA) but decreased in both the 10(-5) M group (723 +/- 38 pA) and the 10(-4) M group (798 +/- 62 pA) (P less than 0.002 vs no-ketamine cells for both groups). We conclude that ketamine has a direct inhibitory effect on transsarcolemmal calcium influx in guinea pig myocardial cells.","Anesthesia and analgesia","1952182",1991,"United States"
"A method for the harvest, culture, and characterization of human adult atrial myocardial cells: correlation with age of donor.","Myocardial cell culture methods are now well established for animal and fetal human tissue. We present here a method for harvesting and culturing adult human atrial myocardiocytes. Cells are obtained from fresh atrial tissue normally discarded after being removed to cannulate the right atrium during open heart surgery. The atrial tissue is minced and then digested using collagenase. The single cell suspension is initially cultured in serum-containing growth medium, then transferred to defined medium, selective for myocardial cell growth. The cells are characterized by immunoperoxidase stains and transmission electron microscopy. The cultured cells stain positive for myoglobin, whereas control cultured fibroblasts and endothelial cells do not. Electron microscopy shows the presence of numerous myofibrils, Z-bodies, pleomorphic mitochondria, and secretory granules. The chronological age of the donor was an important factor in culturing the adult tissue, the younger tissue correlated with a higher success rate. This method provides a means for in vitro study of human adult myocardial cells and provides guidelines for appropriate atrial tissue to use.","In vitro cellular &amp; developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture Association","1757396",1991,"United States"
"Compartmentation of cAMP in adult canine ventricular myocytes. Relation to single-cell free Ca2+ transients.","Isolated adult canine ventricular myocytes were used to study the role of compartmentation of cAMP in the diverse functional responses to various drugs that elevate cAMP. Myocytes presented with the beta-agonist isoproterenol accumulated cAMP with a half maximally effective concentration (EC50) of 3.55 x 10(-8) M. Approximately 45% of the total cAMP was recovered in the particulate fraction of digitonin-lysed myocytes under these conditions. With phosphodiesterase inhibition (10 microM isobutylmethylxanthine), isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production was up to 3.4-fold greater, but the proportion of total cAMP residing in the particulate fraction declined to less than 20%. Similar results were obtained with forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. Treatment with isoproterenol shortened the duration at 50% maximum peak height (T 1/2) and increased the peak fluorescence ratio of electrically triggered single-cell free Ca2+ transients in fura-2-loaded canine myocytes. Isoproterenol dose-response curves gave EC50 values of 1.7 x 10(-9) and 4.4 x 10(-9) M for effects on T 1/2 and peak height, respectively. Alterations in peak height and T 1/2 of Ca2+ transients also showed a dose dependency on isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin. Comparison of myocyte cAMP content with the corresponding changes in free Ca2+ transients demonstrated a close correlation between particulate cAMP and the extent of shortening or increase in peak height of the fura-2 Ca2+ transients (r = 0.92 for each). However, when these two parameters were plotted as a function of total cAMP, the resulting curves were nonlinear and divergent for each agent tested. The results support the hypothesis that differences in responses to agents that augment cAMP can be explained in part by compartmentation of cAMP. Furthermore, Ca2+ mobilization seems to be most affected by cAMP located in the particulate compartment of canine cardiac myocytes.","Circulation research","1682066",1991,"United States"
"Signal transduction by cGMP in heart.","Early studies in whole heart indicated that cGMP antagonized the positive inotropic effects of catecholamines and cAMP. However, the regulation of cGMP levels by a variety of agents was not always consistent with their effects on contractility. It is now clear that at least two major cell types in whole heart, cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, differ markedly in their mechanisms of cGMP regulation and response to cGMP. Furthermore, experiments on isolated cardiac myocytes indicate that the mechanism of cGMP action even in this single cell type can be multifaceted. Cyclic GMP inhibits the L-type calcium channel current (ICa), which is the major source of Ca++ entry into heart cells, and which plays a predominant role in the initiation and regulation of cardiac electrical and contractile activities. Patch-clamp measurements of ICa indicate that in isolated frog myocytes cGMP inhibits ICa by stimulation of cAMP phosphodiesterase (cGS-PDE), whereas in purified rat ventricular myocytes, cGMP predominantly inhibits ICa via a mechanism involving cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP-PK). Under certain conditions, cGMP can also inhibit a cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase (cGI-PDE) and thereby produce a stimulatory effect on ICa. Biochemical characterization of the endogenous PDEs and cGMP-PK in purified cardiac myocytes provided further evidence in support of these mechanisms of cGMP action on ICa.","Basic research in cardiology","1664725",1991,"Germany"
"Altered patterns of gap junction distribution in ischemic heart disease. An immunohistochemical study of human myocardium using laser scanning confocal microscopy.","Arrhythmias are a common and potentially life-threatening complication of myocardial ischemia and infarction in humans. The structural pathways for the rapid intercellular conduction of the electrical impulse that stimulates coordinated contraction in the myocardium are formed by the gap junctions situated at intercalated disks. By raising antibodies to cardiac gap-junctional protein, and using these antibodies in an immunohistochemical procedure in combination with the technique of laser scanning confocal microscopy, we have succeeded in localizing gap junctions, with a clarity not previously possible, through thick volumes of human myocardial tissue. To explore the structural basis for ischemia and infarction-related arrhythmogenesis, antibody labeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy were applied to study the organization, distribution, and other characteristics of gap junctions in the explanted hearts of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation for advanced ischemic heart disease. In areas of myocardium free from histologically detectable structural damage, there was no significant difference in the size of distribution of labeled gap junctions, or in their number per intercalated disk, between left ventricular tissue (in which functional impairment was severe) and right ventricular tissue (in which functional impairment was minimal). However, in myocytes at the border of healed infarcts--zones to which the slow conduction responsible for reentry arrhythmias has been localized--the organization of gap junctions was markedly disordered; instead of being aggregated into discrete intercalated disks, gap-junctional immunostaining was spread extensively over myocyte surfaces. Some infarct zones were bridged by continuous strands of myocytes, coupled to one another by gap junctions, thereby linking healthy myocardium on either side. At their thinnest, these bridges were in some instances no wider than a single attenuated myocyte. The conclusions are 1) a widespread, generalized derangement of gap junction organization does not appear to underlie functional impairment in the ischemic heart, 2) a disorderly arrangement typifies gap junctions in myocytes of the infarct border zone, and this may contribute to alterations in conduction that are capable of precipitating reentry arrhythmias, and 3) delicate chains of myocytes traverse some healed infarcts, apparently forming electrically coupled bridges across what would otherwise constitute blocked zones. The weakest link in this chain can be a single, degenerating myocyte; avoidance of arrhythmia may therefore depend on the continued survival of this single cell.","The American journal of pathology","1656760",1991,"United Kingdom"
"Conduction in bullfrog atrial strands: simulations of the role of disc and extracellular resistance.","A number of fundamental properties of intercellular conduction in simulated cylindrical strands of cardiac tissue are examined. The paper is based on recent biophysical information describing the transmembrane ionic currents in bullfrog atrial cells as well as anatomical data on the structures (gap junctions) responsible for the coupling between cells in that tissue. A mathematical model of the single bullfrog atrial cell based on suction microelectrode single-cell voltage clamp data is employed, as well as a modified version of the well-known model of Heppner and Plonsey, to characterized the resistive connections between adjacent cells in a cardiac strand. In addition, the simulated cellular strand is assumed to be encased in a cylindrical, resistive endothelial sheath, thus forming an idealized atrial trabeculum; the trabeculum is immersed in an extensive volume conductor. It is possible to simulate both uniform and discontinuous conduction in this atrial strand model by appropriately changing the resistance of the intercalated discs that occur at cell boundaries. The conduction velocity achieved in the normal or control case is within the range of conduction velocities that have been measured for bullfrog atrial trabeculae using optical methods. Extracellular resistance is shown to have a significant effect on both conduction velocity and the critical value of disc resistance at which discontinuous conduction first occurs. Since the atrial cell model employed in this study is based on experimental data and can accurately simulate the atrial action potential, the transmembrane ionic currents generated by the model are capable of providing detailed information concerning the mechanisms of intercellular current spread, particularly in the region of the intercalated disc.","Mathematical biosciences","1802175",1991,"United States"
"A cellular mechanism for impaired posthypoxic relaxation in isolated cardiac myocytes. Altered myofilament relaxation kinetics at reoxygenation.","Single, isolated rat ventricular myocytes were made hypoxic for 10 minutes and then reoxygenated. During hypoxia, there was a marked abbreviation of the mechanical twitch, without a decrease in its amplitude. Immediately after reoxygenation, both the time to peak shortening and the duration of relaxation were markedly prolonged, and they remained prolonged for 10-50 minutes. The alterations in contraction and relaxation were not associated with any change in the time course of either the transmembrane action potential or the cytosolic calcium transient, as recorded with the fluorescent probe indo 1. Intracellular pH, measured with a fluorescent probe (carboxyseminaphthorhodofluor), showed an acid shift during hypoxia and an alkaline rebound immediately after reoxygenation. The time courses of intracellular pH and contraction duration were not parallel during hypoxia or reoxygenation, and simulation of the alkaline pH shift by lowering PCO2 or superfusing NH4Cl (in the absence of exposure to hypoxia) did not quantitatively reproduce the prolongation of relaxation seen after reoxygenation. The prolongation of contraction after reoxygenation could be overridden by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the nonenzymatic phosphatase butanedione monoxime. We conclude that delayed relaxation after reoxygenation exists at the single cell level and is due to an alteration of the properties of the myofilaments. Intracellular pH is not the primary mediator of this alteration. We speculate that alteration of intracellular inorganic phosphate or covalent modification of the myofilaments might be involved.","Circulation research","2054932",1991,"United States"
"Persistence of an embryonic intermediate filament-associated protein in the smooth muscle cells of elastic arteries and in Purkinje fibres.","During differentiation of most myogenic tissues, vimentin is transiently expressed as the intermediate filament (IF) protein subunit and is progressively replaced by desmin. However, smooth muscle cells of mature vascular tissue contain variable amounts of vimentin whose cellular content decreases as function of the distance from the heart. IFAPa-400 is a developmentally regulated IF crosslinker protein whose expression appears to parallel that of vimentin during chick myogenesis. Immunohistological and immunoblot techniques were employed to study the expression of this protein in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells of the adult chicken. As observed for vimentin, the expression of IFAPa-400 persists in the mature smooth muscle cells of the large arteries as they leave the heart. However, both of these proteins are down-regulated according to a proximo-distal gradient with respect to the distance from the heart. Conversely, desmin is much more abundant in the distal segments of the aorta. Thus, the co-ordinate expression of vimentin with IFAPa-400 may be a characteristic feature of elastic vascular tissue in which it could meet mechanical requirements close to those of the embryonic cells expressing them. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the single cell type which continues to express the vimentin-IFAPa-400 combination in the mature heart is the Purkinje fibres, which are also subjected to high mechanical tensions but in which myofibrils are generally sparse compared to working myocytes.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","1791636",1991,"England"
"NADH measurements in adult rat myocytes during simulated ischemia.","In isolated adult rat myocytes, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic inhibition and simulated ischemia regulate the NADH/NAD+ redox couple with concomitant impairment of energy-dependent process, including contraction and maintenance of high-energy phosphate stores. We developed a method to examine the relationship among the redox couple, ATP content, and contractile performance in single cells under several conditions analogous to myocardial ischemia, with and without reperfusion. Myocytes were paced at 1 Hz while cell contraction and NADH fluorescence were determined simultaneously for single cells at 37 degrees C. Cells were exposed to cyanide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (metabolic inhibition) or to metabolic inhibition plus 12 mM KCl and 20 mM lactate at pH 6.5 (simulated ischemia). Pyridine nucleotide fluorescence signals from single cells studied in this fashion could be modulated by metabolic inhibitors in a manner similar to that classically described for isolated mitochondria. Metabolic inhibition or simulated ischemia quickly produced maximal reduction of NAD+ to NADH. When cells were exposed to simulated ischemia for 10 min, then superfused with glucose-containing control buffer, 28% of cells exposed to conditions of simulated ischemia developed hypercontracture on reperfusion. Hypercontracture developed despite mitochondrial electron transport being reestablished. When myocyte suspensions in a cuvette were studied spectrofluorimetrically, the pyridine nucleotide fluorescence response to metabolic inhibitors was similar to that for a single cell. This permitted correlation of ATP determinations on cells in suspension with contractile and fluorescence measurements from single myocytes. In the absence of glycolysis there is correspondence among loss of electron transport, decline in high-energy phosphate concentration, and decline in contraction. Irreversible disruption of the electron transport process does not appear to be an early event in ischemic injury.","The American journal of physiology","2058713",1991,"United States"
"Two types of voltage-dependent calcium channel currents and their modulation by parathyroid hormone in neonatal rat ventricular cells.","The positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in cardiac cells are considered to be related to the modulation of calcium influx. The underlying mechanisms, however, are unknown, and direct electrophysiological evidence at the single-cell level is required. In the present study, the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used in neonatal rat ventricular cells to identify both transient (T) and long-lasting (L) voltage-dependent calcium channels according to their electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics. The active synthetic fragment of bovine PTH, bPTH-(1-34), at a concentration of 1 microM, significantly enhanced the magnitude of L-channel currents by 67.8% (n = 13, p less than 0.01). The steady-state activation curve of L-channel currents was shifted along the voltage axis toward more negative potentials by either bPTH-(1-34) or Bay K-8644. The suppression or amplification of PTH-induced enhancement of inward currents by nifedipine, 1 microM, or Bay K-8644, 5 microM, respectively, further indicated that the effect of PTH was specific for L-type calcium channels. However, bPTH-(1-34) failed to modulate the magnitude or kinetics of T-channel currents. This study directly demonstrates that PTH is a specific endogenous calcium-channel activator in neonatal rat ventricular cells.","Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology","1714026",1991,"United States"
"A model of the ventricular cardiac action potential. Depolarization, repolarization, and their interaction.","A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses (&quot;chaotic activity&quot;) are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.","Circulation research","1709839",1991,"United States"
"Effect of halothane on arrhythmogenic responses induced by sympathomimetic agents in single rat heart cells.","The combination of catecholamines and halothane has long been recognized as arrhythmogenic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mechanism of this interaction originates at the single cell level. The incidence of spontaneous contractile waves occurring between stimulated beats (interbeat waves), early aftercontractions, and late aftercontractions was measured in rat myocytes exposed to sympathomimetics with and without halothane. Each of these endpoints in single cells has the potential to produce arrhythmias in multicellular preparations. Interbeat waves and late aftercontractions were observed with isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M) and norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M). The incidence of these phenomena was significantly reduced in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. Early aftercontractions occurred in the presence of isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M), norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M), and phenylephrine (5-10 X 10(-6) M). There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of early aftercontractions in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. These results indicate that the mechanism behind the clinically observed increased arrhythmogenicity of catecholamines with halothane does not arise at the level of single ventricular cells because halothane inhibited sympathomimetic-induced arrhythmogenic activity in this model. The probable mechanisms rather include altered impulse propagation, which might lead to phenomena such as reentry.","Anesthesia and analgesia","2018215",1991,"United States"
"Disseminated human malignant melanoma in congenitally immune-deficient (bg/nu/xid) mice.","Congenitally immune-deficient bg/nu/xid (BNX) mice are severely compromised in their ability to mount T-cell, B-cell, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell responses. Successful engraftment of BNX mice with human hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated recently. We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification.","Journal of the National Cancer Institute","1995918",1991,"United States"
"Effects of charged amphiphiles on cardiac cell contractility are mediated via effects on Ca2+ current.","Exposure of isolated adult rabbit myocytes to the negatively charged amphiphile dodecylsulfate (DDS; 10 microM) increased the contraction amplitude to 185% of control. The positively charged amphiphile dodecyltrimethylammonium (DDTMA; 10 microM) decreased the amplitude to 58%. DDS increased Ca2+ uptake by the same cells, but this uptake was partially prevented by nifedipine. DDTMA had no effect on Ca2+ uptake. Ca2+ binding to isolated sarcolemma of neonatal heart cells was increased by 10 microM DDS and, at higher concentrations, reduced by DDTMA. Single-cell voltage-clamp studies, using isolated rabbit myocytes, showed that DDS enhanced L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L), whereas DDTMA depressed ICa,L. DDS shifted current-voltage (I-V) and isochronal inactivation curves of ICa,L in the negative direction, whereas DDTMA shifted them in positive direction. Furthermore, DDS depressed T-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,T), and DDTMA enhanced ICa,T. The inotropic effects of the amphiphiles are therefore mediated to a significant degree by ICa,L. The shifts in the I-V and inactivation curves of ICa,L and the effect on ICa,T can be explained by changes in the actual membrane potential (Em), induced by the insertion of the amphiphiles in the outer monolayer of the sarcolemma. However, the changes in the Em do not explain the effect on the maximal current, indicating effects on the channel per se, possibly by an alteration of the lipid environment.","The American journal of physiology","1825746",1991,"United States"
"Modulation of collision-induced changes in canine heart repolarization by cycle length.","The possibility that cycle length modulates the electronic effect of activation sequence on repolarization was investigated in experiments using isolated canine cardiac Purkinje strands, in situ canine ventricular myocardium, and computer simulations. Action potential durations and refractory periods during one-way propagation were compared to those obtained during action potential collision. In both the computer simulations and the Purkinje strand experiments, collision decreased action potential duration more at long cycle lengths than at short cycle lengths. Comparably, collision of activation fronts in ventricular myocardium was associated with greater reductions in refractory period during pacing at long cycle lengths than at short cycle lengths. Theoretic considerations indicate that the magnitude of electrotonic effects of activation sequence on repolarization are directly related to action potential height and the square root of membrane resistance during repolarization and are inversely related to conduction velocity. In computer simulations and Purkinje strand experiments, changes in conduction velocity and action potential height elicited by decreasing cycle length could not fully account for the cycle length dependence of collision-induced changes in repolarization. Time-varying membrane resistance of a single cell was calculated in the simulations by briefly hyperpolarizing the membrane and determining the change in total ionic current. Membrane resistance during repolarization was less at short cycle lengths than at long cycle lengths. The results suggest the cycle length dependence of collision-induced changes in repolarization results largely from the effect of cycle length on membrane resistance during action potential repolarization, with changes in action potential height and conduction velocity playing a lesser role.","Journal of electrocardiology","2056267",1991,"United States"
"Altered cell function in microgravity.","Physiological changes in humans during spaceflight upon return to earth have been attributed to systemic adaptation, response to stress, and lack of normal exercise. Studies from the Skylab, SL-3, and D-1 missions have demonstrated that significant physiological alterations are seen in single cell prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as well as in animal tissues. Basic cellular functions such as electrolyte concentration, cell growth rate, glucose utilization, bone formation, response to growth stimulation, and exocytosis are modified in microgravity. Many of the physiological changes seen in humans, vertebrate and simple organisms in spaceflight may originate from dysfunction of basic biological mechanisms caused by microgravity. Aging humans share many of the symptoms seen in astronauts during spaceflight. These include reduced cardiac function, loss of bone and reduced immune response and orthostatic hypotension. It is possible that some of physiological adaptations seen in aging may share common physiological basis with those changes seen in spaceflight. Since microgravity affects prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell function at a subcellular and molecular level, space offers us an opportunity to learn more about basic biological mechanisms which are essential to life.","Experimental gerontology","1915694",1991,"England"

"Ten- and ninety-day toxicity studies of 1,2-dichlorobenzene administered by oral gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats.","Ten- and ninety-day toxicity studies of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were conducted in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to meet the needs of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for toxicity data on this chemical for use in their determination of possible health risks related to human exposure. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene was administered at doses of 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day (10-day), and 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (90-day) in corn oil by oral gavage; control animals received corn oil. At time of sacrifice, gross necropsies were performed and selected tissues were weighed and prepared for histological evaluation. Blood was taken for hematology and clinical chemistries. In the 10-day study, exposure of 300 mg DCB/kg body weight to male rats resulted in a statistically significant decrease in final body weight, organ weights (heart, kidneys, spleen, testes, and thymus), and relative organ weights (spleen and thymus). A significant increase in absolute and relative liver weights was also noted in this dose group. Males also displayed significant increases in water consumption (300 mg/kg group), ALT (300 mg/kg) and leukocyte count (150 and 300 mg/kg). A significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular necrosis was seen in the 300 mg/kg group of males compared to controls. In the 90-day study, male rats exposed to 400 mg DCB/kg displayed a statistically significant decrease in body weight, organ weight (spleen), and relative organ weight (spleen). The absolute weights of kidney and liver and the relative weights for heart, kidney, liver, lung, brain, and testes were increased significantly for this dose group. The absolute and relative weights of both the kidney and liver were significantly increased in the female 400 mg/kg dose group. The only clinical chemistry parameters statistically different than control were increased ALT (100 and 400 mg/kg groups), BUN and total bilirubin in the male 400 mg/kg group and total bilirubin in the 400 mg/kg female group. Histopathological evaluation showed hepatocellular lesions associated with DCB treatment which included centrolobular degeneration and hypertrophy, and single cell necrosis in male and females receiving 400 mg DCB/kg. The NOAEL observed in this study is 25 mg/kg/day.","Drug and chemical toxicology","1889379",1991,"United States"
"The ultrastructure of patch-clamped membranes: a study using high voltage electron microscopy.","We have developed techniques for studying patch-clamped membranes inside glass pipettes using high voltage electron microscopy (HVEM). To preserve the patch structure with the least possible distortion, we rapidly froze and freeze dried the pipette tip. The pipette is transparent for more than 50 microns from the tip. HVEM images of patches confirm light microscopy observations that the patch is not a bare bilayer, but a membrane-covered bleb of cytoplasm that may include organelles and cytoskeleton. The membrane that spans the pipette is commonly tens of micrometers from the tip of the pipette and occasionally as far as 100 microns. The structure of patches taken from a single cell type is variable but there are consistent differences between patches made from different cell types. With suction applied to the pipette before seal formation, we have seen in the light microscope vesicles swept from the plasmalemma up the pipette. These vesicles are visible in electron micrographs, particularly those made from chick cardiac muscle. Colloidal gold labeling of the patch permitted identification of lectin-binding sites and acetylcholine receptors. In young cultures of Xenopus myocytes, the receptors were diffuse. In 1-wk-old cultures, the receptors formed densely packed arrays. The patch pipette can serve, not only as a recording device, but as a tool for sampling discrete regions of the cell surface. Because the pipette has a constant path length for axial rotation, it is a unique specimen holder for microtomography. We have made preliminary tomographic reconstructions of a patch from Xenopus oocyte.","The Journal of cell biology","1702442",1991,"United States"
"Immunological cross-reactivity between Streptococcus mutans and human heart tissue examined by cross-immunization experiments.","Hyperimmunization of rabbits with Streptococcus mutans or other related cariogenic streptococci sometimes induces serum antibodies that react with human heart muscle. To determine whether antigen I/II (AgI/II), a major surface protein antigen present in most human isolates of these organisms, was responsible for inducing cross-reactive antibodies, we tested it for antigenic similarity to heart components, exploiting the ability of immune systems to mount anamnestic responses to antigens previously encountered. Mice immunized with a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes type M6, known to be heart cross-reactive, or with intact S. mutans cells developed antibodies that could be detected on a human heart sarcolemmal preparation. However, mice immunized with AgI/II and boosted with sarcolemma were unable to develop significant antisarcolemmal antibodies attributable to prior sensitization by AgI/II. Similarly, AgI/II was unable to recall antisarcolemmal responses in mice previously immunized with sarcolemma. Nevertheless, strong immunoglobulin G antibody responses to AgI/II were detected at the single-cell level in spleens and as circulating antibodies in all mice immunized with AgI/II or AgI/II-bearing S. mutans. We conclude that the ability of S. mutans to induce heart-reactive antibodies is not due to antigenic similarity between AgI/II and components of human heart but may be caused by other cross-reactive antigens in the bacterial cells or by nonspecific stimulation of the immune system.","Infection and immunity","2228225",1990,"United States"
"Biomedical and clinical applications of automated single cell electrophoresis.","The automated single cell electrophoresis microscope Parmoquant has been used for the discrimination of lymphocytes and the study of the interaction of substances with cells and synthetic particles. Electrophoretic histograms allowed the determination of changes in the proportion of lymphocyte populations after kidney transplantation, during dialysis treatment, open heart surgery and during pregnancy. Discrimination of leukemic cells on the basis of electrophoresis was used as an additional parameter in diagnosis. In a mouse tumor model, histogram determination enabled the in vivo effect of the tumor necrosis factor on immune cells to be evaluated. Cell electrophoresis was shown to be suitable to detect the influence of antibodies, lectins and bacteria on the cell surface. Protein adsorption was studied on synthetic particles using cell electrophoresis. This method was applied to investigate the phenomena of blood interaction with biomaterials used in artificial organs and to determine differences in the protein composition of serum or other body fluids connected with diseases.","Electrophoresis","2079045",1990,"Germany"
"Inhibition of the fast sodium inward current in ventricular cardiomyocytes of rats and guinea pigs by a novel potent sodium channel blocking agent.","In enzymatically-dispersed single ventricular cardiomyocytes of adult rats and guinea pigs the inhibition of the cardiac sodium current by a novel sodium channel blocking agent (LG 83-6-05, 1-[3-(2-Hydroxy-3-(2-methylpropylamino)-propoxy)-4-methyl-2- thienyl++ ]-3-phenyl-1-propanon hydrochloride) was studied. A single-electrode voltage-clamp system (switch clamping, patch electrodes) was used to measure action potentials as well as ionic currents during voltage-clamp experiments. In addition single channel measurements were performed using the patch-clamp technique. The single cell system enabled us to demonstrate that LG 83-6-05 is an inhibitor of the cardiac sodium current. The substance acts concentration-dependently and belongs to the most potent sodium-channel blocking agents known. It could be shown that the whole-cell sodium inward current is blocked in a frequency-dependent manner (phasic block) and that the steady-state inactivation curve of the sodium current is shifted significantly towards negative potentials, indicating a considerable tonic block at the resting membrane potential. The time constant of the recovery from inactivation of the sodium current as estimated from voltage-clamp experiments is prolonged by a factor of up to 290 (holding potential -110 mV, 2 mumol/l). This prolongation is voltage dependent, faster release from block occurring at more negative potentials. The open state probability of the single cardiac sodium channel is reduced in a frequency-dependent manner, whereas its current amplitude remains unchanged during the influence of the substance. The number of channels not available for opening is increased considerably with increasing stimulus frequency. These findings suggest stabilization of the inactivated state of the ionic channel by drug binding.","Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology","1965329",1990,"Germany"
"A new method of attachment of isolated mammalian ventricular myocytes for tension recording: length dependence of passive and active tension.","The study of the Frank-Starling's law in mammalian single cells has been hindered by a lack of an easily performed method of stretching cells. Some authors have succeeded in this but their methods required a great deal of technical expertise and in most cases they have not had much success. We have developed an easy method of stretching mammalian ventricular cells from slack sarcomere length (S.L.) (Lo, 1.77 +/- 0.05 microns) to about 117% of this length. Thin carbon fibers (12 microns in diameter) which can be bound electrochemically to the cell membrane surface have been used. A flexible long fiber of known compliance (80 microns/microN) was attached to one end of the cell and a stiff double fiber (4 microns/microN) to the other end. The cell attachment was relatively easy to perform and successful results were obtained in 80% of the attempts. The displacement of the flexible fiber allows the quantitative measurements of the resting tension in a group of non-stimulated cells and of auxotonic contractions developed upon stimulation in another group of cells. Increasing S.L. from Lo to 105-106% of Lo, an increase in active tension from 0.21 +/- 0.03 mN/mm to 0.26 +/- 0.01 mN/mm (n = 4) could be noticed with a stimulation frequency of 0.5 Hz. An increase in active tension was also observed at 1 Hz. Staircase kinetics were accelerated with stretching; this confirms at the single cell level the hypothesis of an effect of length-dependent activation on the staircase. Eulerian differential stiffness constant was calculated and found to be 13.5 +/- 1.2, a value which is comparable to that described in intact heart. Thus the important stiffness found in the whole heart may be due to intracellular component(s) such as myofilament and/or connectin.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","2095433",1990,"England"
"Monophasic versus biphasic cardiac stimulation: mechanism of decreased energy requirements.","The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of monophasic and biphasic stimulation under conditions of full and incomplete repolarization in an in vivo dog model and in an in vitro rabbit ventricular single cell model. Strength-interval curves were constructed with monophasic cathodal stimulation and biphasic subthreshold anodal followed by cathodal stimulation in dogs prior to and late after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. At the monophasic absolute refractory period plus 10 msec, less cathodal current was required for biphasic compared to monophasic stimulation (P = 0.04). Moreover, the biphasic absolute ventricular refractory period (116 +/- 8 msec) was significantly shorter than the monophasic absolute ventricular refractory period (136 +/- 15 msec) (P less than 0.02). At coupling intervals greater than 30 msec after the monophasic absolute ventricular refractory period, there was no distinction between monophasic and biphasic stimuli. Similarly enhanced excitability was observed with biphasic stimuli in infarcted hearts. Voltage clamp measurements mimicking conditions of the in vivo studies demonstrated that when repolarization is incomplete, a hyperpolarizing prepulse reactivates additional sodium current resulting in enhanced excitability. In conclusion, biphasic stimulation consisting of a hyperpolarizing anodal prepulse followed by a cathodal pulse decreases the current required for excitation compared to cathodal monophasic stimulation in a critical zone near the ventricular absolute refractory period.","Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE","1701542",1990,"United States"
"[The blocking effect of ethmozin on sodium current in single myocardial cell].","Effects of ethmozin on sodium current in isolated single ventricular cells were studied using a giga-ohm seal patch electrode and whole cell clamp technique. The results were quite similar with the previous paper on multiple ventricular cell preparation. Further evidences were used to clarify the uncertainty in the previous work of using conventional microelectrode to record action potential. Ethmozin (1-5 mg/L) suppressed phase 0 of action potential recorded in single cell without significant influence on other portions of action potential, which was shown in current clamp mode. In voltage clamp mode, suppress of sodium current (INa) by ethmozin could be recorded through all the physiological voltage range with slight shift of peak (INa) to the positive voltage. Time course of decay of INa was also slowed down by ethmozin. Thus, the mechanism of the slowing down of the rising phase and propagation velocity as well as a rise in threshold of excitability in ventricular muscle reported before was disclosed. Furthermore, ethmozin modified recovery course of INa by decelerating it, which confirmed its use-dependent action discovered before. However, ethmozin promotes its block effect on INa with tonic block stronger than phasic block. Ethmozin has no influence on other membrane current components such as slow inward calcium current and outward potassium current in the present doses. It was concluded that ethmozin is a specified sodium blocker with modification actions on its gating process.","Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi","1964893",1990,"China"
"Effect of acidosis on intracellular pH and calcium concentration in the newborn and adult rabbit myocardium.","This study investigated developmental changes in the effect of acidosis on intracellular pH (pHi) and [Ca]i in the isolated heart and isolated myocyte preparations. The whole heart or myocytes of newborn (5-7 days old) and adult rabbits were loaded with the fluorescent pH indicator 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) or calcium indicator fura-2. Left ventricular pressure in the isolated heart preparation and the magnitude of cell contraction in the single-cell preparation were monitored. The heart and single cell were illuminated with excitation lights (340 and 380 nm, respectively, for fura-2 and 438 and 490 nm for BCECF). The intensity of fluorescence from the ventricular surface or from the cell was detected. [Ca]i was estimated from the following ratio: fluorescence at 505 nm during excitation at 340 nm/fluorescence at 505 nm during excitation at 380 nm. pHi was estimated from the following ratio: fluorescence at 530 nm during excitation at 490 nm/fluorescence at 530 nm during excitation at 438 nm. In the newborn, depression of contractile function during respiratory acidosis or metabolic acidosis was less than in the adult. Diastolic and systolic [Ca]i increased during respiratory acidosis in both the newborn and adult, and the net changes in [Ca]i were similar in the two age groups. During respiratory or metabolic acidosis, pHi decreased, but the decrease in the newborn was significantly less than in the adult. These data suggest that the greater resistance of the newborn myocardium to acidosis is due to the smaller change of pHi in this age group and not due to the difference in [Ca]i alteration.","Circulation research","2364486",1990,"United States"
"Generation and characterization of Dictyostelium cells deficient in a myosin I heavy chain isoform.","Motile activities such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis, which occur in Dictyostelium cells lacking myosin II, may be dependent upon myosin I. To begin to explore this possibility, we have engineered a disruption of the Dictyostelium myosin I heavy chain (DMIHC) gene described recently (Jung, G., C. L. Saxe III, A. R. Kimmel, and J. A. Hammer III. 1989. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86:6186-6190). The double-crossover, gene disruption event that occurred resulted in replacement of the middle approximate one-third of the gene with the neomycin resistance marker. The resulting cells are devoid of both the 3.6-kb DMIHC gene transcript and the 124-kD DMIHC polypeptide. DMIHC- cells are capable of chemotactic streaming and aggregation, but these processes are delayed. Furthermore, the rate of phagocytosis by DMIHC- cells is reduced, as assessed by growth rate on lawns of heat-killed bacteria and on the initial rate of uptake of FITC-labeled bacteria. Therefore, this Dictyostelium myosin I isoform appears to play a role in supporting chemotaxis and phagocytosis, but it is clearly not required for these processes to occur. Using a portion of the DMIHC gene as a probe, we have cloned three additional Dictyostelium small myosin heavy chain genes. Comparison of these four genes with three genes described recently by Titus et al. (Titus, M. A., H. M. Warrick, and J. A. Spudich. 1989. Cell Reg. 1:55-63) indicates that there are at least five small myosin heavy chain genes in Dictyostelium. The probability that there is considerable overlap of function between these small myosin isoforms indicates that multiple gene disruptions within a single cell may be necessary to generate a more striking myosin I- phenotype.","The Journal of cell biology","2141028",1990,"United States"
"Clonal analysis of graft-infiltrating lymphocytes from renal and cardiac biopsies. Dominant rearrangements of TcR beta genes and persistence of dominant rearrangements in serial biopsies.","Graft-infiltrating lymphocytes from both human renal and cardiac allografts were propagated in interleukin 2 in order to evaluate rearrangements in the T-cell receptor (TcR) beta-chain genes. Individual biopsies from renal allografts during episodes of cellular rejection were examined as well as multiple biopsies of heart transplant patients from whom endomyocardial samples were taken prior to, during, and after episodes of rejection. TcR beta-chain rearrangements were evaluated in Southern blots using DNA extracted from interleukin 2-propagated cells and digested with restriction endonucleases permitting assessment of rearrangements to both C beta 1 and C beta 2. Rearrangements shared among greater than 5% of the &quot;bulk&quot; culture appear as nongermline bands when hybridized with a C beta probe. Single-cell progeny were generated from limiting dilution, and the rearrangements among the cloned progeny compared to the &quot;bulk&quot; of the cultured progeny of graft-infiltrating lymphocytes. The results indicate that &quot;dominant&quot; rearrangements are a common feature of renal allograft-infiltrating lymphocytes (14 of 15 cases examined). Since the number of cells which can be recovered from a given cardiac biopsy may be limiting, evaluation of clonal dominance from these cultures is more difficult to evaluate. However, sharing of &quot;dominant&quot; rearrangements among multiple biopsies from the same cardiac allograft patient indicates an in vivo selection for T cells with the same receptor rearrangement. Analysis of individual clones showed 3/33 clones from a renal allograft sharing the &quot;dominant&quot; rearrangement noted in the bulk culture, but none of these &quot;dominant&quot; clones showed antidonor specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Human immunology","2141012",1990,"United States"
"A model of the single atrial cell: relation between calcium current and calcium release.","The hypothesis that calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac muscle is induced by rises in free cytosolic calcium (Fabiato 1983, Am. J. Physiol 245) allows the possibility that the release could be at least partly regenerative. There would then be a non-linear relation between calcium current and calcium release. We have investigated this possibility in a single-cell version of the rabbit-atrial model developed by Hilgemann &amp; Noble (1987, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 230). The model predicts different voltage ranges of activation for calcium-dependent processes (like the sodium-calcium exchange current, contraction or Fura-2 signals) and the calcium current, in agreement with the experimental results obtained by Earm et al. (1990, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 240) on exchange current tails, Cannell et al. (1987, Science, Wash. 238) by using Fura-2 signals, and Fedida et al. (1987, J. Physiol., Lond. 385) and Talo et al. (1988, Biology of isolated adult cardiac myocytes) by using contraction. However, when the Fura-2 concentration is sufficiently high (greater than 200 microM) the activation ranges become very similar as the buffering properties of Fura-2 are sufficient to remove the regenerative effect. It is therefore important to allow for the buffering properties of calcium indicators when investigating the correlation between calcium current and calcium release.","Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

"In vitro analysis of cardiac progenitor cell differentiation.","Cardiac myoblast commitment and differentiation were studied in the developing avian embryo. Single cell analysis of isolated cardiogenic cells grown in vitro established that stage 4 (newly gastrulated) mesodermal cells are capable of myocyte differentiation in the absence of intercellular contact or short range cellular interactions. While cardiac myocytes derived from single isolated progenitors expressed muscle-specific myosin heavy chains (MHC), atrial and ventricular MHCs characteristic of in vivo development were not detected. When the same progenitors were grown at high density or in organ cultures, cell-specific, expression of atrial and ventricular MHCs was observed, suggesting a role of cell density-dependent processes for differential MHC expression. Cardiogenic mesoderm (stages 4-8) was treated with the cocarcinogen 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), maintained as organ cultures, and assayed for muscle differentiation in an attempt to identify possible stage-specific variations in cardiac progenitors. TPA irreversibly blocked the differentiation of early (stages 4-7) progenitors. When exposed to TPA, stages 4-7 cardiogenic cells failed to synthesize several muscle-specific proteins as determined by immunochemical analysis of myosin synthesis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 35S-labeled proteins isolated from cardiogenic cultures. In addition, stages 4-7, TPA-treated cells did not differentiate after the withdrawal of TPA. In contrast, TPA had no effect on the expression of several muscle-specific proteins in late (stage 8) cells including the cell-specific expression of atrial and ventricular MHCs.","Developmental biology","2328836",1990,"United States"
"[Single cell preparation of the human heart. Technic of dissociation and isolation of myocytes].","This paper describes a procedure of cellular dissociation which allows the isolation of single cells from the human heart while preserving their integrity and physiological function necessary for electrophysiological studies in vitro. During open heart surgery, biopsies were obtained from the right atrium of the beating heart in 16 patients immediately before starting the extracorporeal circulation. The tissue was immediately placed in a cardioplegic solution at 4 degrees, and subsequently in a free-calcium solution at 20 degrees from 20' to 30'. It was then exposed to the proteolytic action of Collagenase type I and Protease type VII (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, USA) at 35 degrees for a maximum of 5 hours. The cells were finally transferred into a Tyrode solution at room temperature. With this method we obtained up to 70% of intact human myocytes, 40% of which calcium-tolerant. The subsequent electrophysiological studies performed showed that the cells maintained their morphological and physiological properties.","Minerva cardioangiologica","2196479",1990,"Italy"
"On the mechanism of the &quot;specific bradycardic action&quot; of the verapamil derivative UL-FS 49.","Membrane currents were measured in single sino-atrial node cells of guinea pig and rabbit hearts as well as in guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the patch-clamp technique. UL-FS 49 blocked the L-type calcium current (ICa) in sino-atrial node cells at drug concentrations which had little or no effect on the amplitude of the hyperpolarization-activated current ih(f). In guinea pig ventricular myocytes UL-FS 49 also blocked ICa but not as strongly as in sino-atrial node cells. In a computer simulation of the sino-atrial node action potential the extent of rate reduction by block of either ih(f) or ICa was estimated. From the data obtained by single cell measurements and the computations we concluded that rate reduction in primary pacemaker cells by application of UL-FS 49 is mainly due to a use dependent block of the L-type calcium current. Voltage dependent unblock of iCa at potentials more negative than -50 mV together with the lower drug sensitivity of ventricular cells can explain the &quot;specific bradycardic action&quot; of UL-FS 49.","Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology","1692108",1990,"Germany"
"Electrogenic Na(+)-K+ pump in Purkinje myocytes isolated from control noninfarcted and infarcted hearts.","We combined a method of Na+ loading (zero K+ exposure) with voltage-clamp techniques to determine whether malfunctioning of the Na(+)-K+ pump underlies the abnormalities in the resting potential and the repolarization process observed in subendocardial Purkinje cells dispersed from the canine infarcted ventricle (IZPCs) 24 h after coronary artery occlusion. Stimulation of the transient outward current (ipump) was produced by a 3-min exposure to zero K+ and then reexposure to 4 mM K+ Tyrode solution. We compared the properties of ipump in IZPCs to ipump in Purkinje cells dispersed from fiber strands (SPCs) or from the subendocardium of the normal hearts (NZPCs). For the holding potentials (mean values: SPC, -33 +/- 7; NZPC, -33 +/- 5; and IZPC, -35 +/- 4 mV), the time constant (tau) of ipump in IZPCs (55 +/- 18 s) was not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) from tau in SPCs (55 +/- 10 s) or NZPCs (57 +/- 11 s). Peak ipump (Imax) and total charge transfer (Q) in IZPCs were not different from control. In SPCs and NZPCs, there was an increase in Imax and Q when zero K+ exposure was prolonged to 6-8 min, whereas in some IZPCs, the increase in Imax or Q was smaller. We conclude that the Na(+)-K+ pump current kinetics are not altered in IZPCs compared with control. Thus the persistent electrophysiological abnormalities in IZPCs that can still be observed after single cell isolation (Boyden, P. A., A. Albala, and K. Dresdner. Circ. Res. 65: 955-970, 1989) are not explained by an alteration in the function of the Na(+)-K+ pump.","The American journal of physiology","2156455",1990,"United States"
"Cardiac and respiratory correlations with unit discharge in epileptic human temporal lobe.","We recorded respiratory activity and electrocardiogram (ECG) together with single cell activity from the amygdala and hippocampus of epileptic patients who later received anterotemporal lobectomy. Cross-correlation histograms were used to test for neuronal discharge timing relationships with inspiration or ECG. Linear regression was used to test for correlations of inspiratory time, respiratory period, and heart rate (HR) with tonic unit rate for each breath. Of 129 cells from 16 patients who later had resection, 89 were contralateral and 40 were ipsilateral to the resected lobe. Of the contralateral cells, 19% had a timing relationship with the cardiac cycle and only 1% had such a relationship with the respiratory cycle. Tonic correlations with HR were noted in 22% and with respiratory period and inspiratory time in 11 and 6%. Neither these percentages nor mean discharge rate differed between structures, although variance in rate was much higher on the resected side. Amygdala cells on the resected side showed more correlations with the cardiac cycle (55 vs. 20%), respiratory period (46 vs. 3%), and inspiratory time (27 vs. 7%) and were more likely to show several types of correlation. The results suggest a selective loss of ipsilateral amygdala cells and/or afferents, favoring relationships with cardiac- and respiratory-related systems and a possible synaptic reorganization of remaining cardiorespiratory afferents.","Epilepsia","2318169",1990,"United States"
"Phase resetting in a model of sinoatrial nodal membrane: ionic and topological aspects.","We describe the phase-resetting effect of injecting an isolated current pulse in an ionic model of a single cell of the sinoatrial node. Delivery of a depolarizing pulse early (late) in the cycle results in a prolongation (abbreviation) of the cycle length. With a hyperpolarizing pulse, the effect is reversed. We determine the topological type or degree of phase resetting in two ways: 1) by analyzing interbeat intervals extracted from the voltage waveform, and 2) by analyzing the waveform, not only of the voltage, but of all the activation and inactivation variables. The two methods give similar results. At low (high) pulse amplitudes, there is type 1 (0) phase resetting. When type 1 phase resetting occurs, the new phase is a monotonically increasing function of the old phase at sufficiently low stimulus amplitudes, whereas at higher stimulus amplitudes it is not. Leading roles in generating phase resetting are attributed to the slow inward current and to the leakage current. Comparison is made with experimental phase-resetting findings in the sinoatrial node and other cardiac oscillators. Implications for unidirectional and bidirectional synchronization are also sketched out.","The American journal of physiology","2316689",1990,"United States"
"Perceptron-based learning algorithms.","A key task for connectionist research is the development and analysis of learning algorithms. An examination is made of several supervised learning algorithms for single-cell and network models. The heart of these algorithms is the pocket algorithm, a modification of perceptron learning that makes perceptron learning well-behaved with nonseparable training data, even if the data are noisy and contradictory. Features of these algorithms include speed algorithms fast enough to handle large sets of training data; network scaling properties, i.e. network methods scale up almost as well as single-cell models when the number of inputs is increased; analytic tractability, i.e. upper bounds on classification error are derivable; online learning, i.e. some variants can learn continually, without referring to previous data; and winner-take-all groups or choice groups, i.e. algorithms can be adapted to select one out of a number of possible classifications. These learning algorithms are suitable for applications in machine learning, pattern recognition, and connectionist expert systems.","IEEE transactions on neural networks","18282835",1990,"United States"
"A mathematical model of atrioventricular conduction block using the excitability recovery curve of the myocardial cell.","A simple mathematical model of AV conduction block was constructed on the basis of single-cell electrophysiological experiments concerning the rate-dependent property of excitability of the AV nodal cells (the excitability recovery curve, ERC). This ERC was analogous to the phase response curve (PRC) of cardiac pacemaker cells, which the authors had previously used to construct a model of modulated parasystole. Computer simulation was used to reproduce the ERC. The single-cell ERC was then extended to the entire AV node, and this curve was used to formulate a mathematical model of AV conduction block as a nonlinear, first-order difference equation of the successive PR intervals of the ECG. This model predicted a variety of ECG patterns of AV conduction block: normal rhythm, first-degree block, and several second-degree blocks of complex Wenckebach periodicity in relation to the sinus rate and the shape of the ERC. By assuming this model it was possible to identify the underlying ERC of actual ECGs with complex Wenckebach periodicity.","Journal of electrocardiology","2090767",1990,"United States"
"Chaotic activity in a mathematical model of the vagally driven sinoatrial node.","Phase-locking behavior and irregular dynamics were studied in a mathematical model of the sinus node driven with repetitive vagal input. The central region of the sinus node was simulated as a 15 x 15 array of resistively coupled pacemakers with each cell randomly assigned one of 10 intrinsic cycle lengths (range 290-390 msec). Coupling of the pacemakers resulted in their mutual entrainment to a common frequency and the emergence of a dominant pacemaker region. Repetitive acetylcholine (ACh; vagal) pulses were applied to a randomly selected 60% of the cells. Over a wide range of stimulus intensities and basic cycle lengths, such perturbations resulted in a large variety of stimulus/response patterns, including phase locking (1:1, 3:2, 2:1, etc.) and irregular (i.e., chaotic) dynamics. At a low ACh concentration (1 microM), the patterns followed the typical Farey sequence of phase-locked behavior. At a higher concentration (5 microM), period doubling and aperiodic patterns were found. When a single pacemaker cell was perturbed with repetitive ACh pulses, qualitatively similar results were obtained. In both types of simulation, chaotic behavior was investigated using phase-plane (orbital) plots, Poincar¨¦ mapping, and return mapping. Period-doubling bifurcations (2:2, 4:4, and 8:8) were found temporally and spatially within the array. Under certain conditions of stimulation, the attractor in the return map during chaotic activity of the single cell resembled the Lorenz tent map. However, when electrical coupling between cells was allowed, the interactions with neighboring cells exhibiting chaotic dynamics resulted in characteristic alterations of the attractor geometry. Our results suggest that irregular dynamics obeying the rules derived from other chaotic systems are present during vagal stimulation of the sinus node. In addition, application of the same analytical tools to the analysis of simulation of reflex vagal control of sinus rate suggests that chaotic dynamics can be obtained in the physiologically relevant case of the baroreceptor reflex loop. These results may provide insight into the mechanisms of dynamic vagal control of heart rate and may help to provide insights into clinically relevant disturbances of cardiac rate and rhythm.","Circulation research","2805248",1989,"United States"
"Hyperthyroid adult rat cardiomyocytes. II. Single cell electrophysiology and free calcium transients.","The effects of hyperthyroidism on electrophysiological properties and intracellular free calcium transients in single adult rat cardiomyocytes were studied using conventional microelectrodes and time-resolved single cell fura-2 fluorescence microscopy. Under control conditions, resting membrane potentials and triggered action potentials were not different in euthyroid and hyperthyroid myocytes. Calcium transients produced by electrical stimulation, however, were markedly abbreviated in hyperthyroid myocytes. During a train of stimuli, the duration of the calcium transients at half peak amplitude (half time) was 124 +/- 14 ms at the fifth beat in hyperthyroid cells vs. 287 +/- 35 ms in euthyroid cells. Isoproterenol (1 microM) prolonged time to 50% repolarization (APD50) of the action potentials and increased the peak calcium transients in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid myocytes. It also shortened the half time of the calcium transients in euthyroid myocytes but had little effect on the half time in hyperthyroid cells. These data are consistent with the electrophysiology and mechanical performance in intact euthyroid and hyperthyroid cardiac tissues, and the intrinsic changes in hyperthyroid tissues can therefore be illustrated in single ventricular myocytes. Furthermore, the results suggest that alterations in intracellular calcium handling by sarcoplasmic reticulum may account for contractile changes of the heart induced by hyperthyroidism.","The American journal of physiology","2596589",1989,"United States"
"Electrophysiology and ultrastructure of canine subendocardial Purkinje cells isolated from control and 24-hour infarcted hearts.","Ventricular arrhythmias that accompany myocardial infarction in dogs may be secondary to the altered electrophysiological properties of the subendocardial Purkinje fibers that survive 24 hours after the coronary occlusion. To better understand the ionic mechanisms that underlie the altered electrical activity of these fibers, we have dispersed, using an enzymatic technique, Purkinje cells from the subendocardium of the infarcted ventricle (IZPCs) and compared their electrical and structural properties to Purkinje cells dispersed from fiber strands (SPCs) and from the subendocardium of the noninfarcted ventricle (NZPCs). Ultrastructural analysis of these cells shows that IZPCs contain an increased number of lipid droplets when compared with the SPCs and NZPCs. In addition, transmembrane action potentials of IZPCs have reduced resting potentials, action potential amplitudes, and upstroke velocity and are increased in duration when compared with either SPCs or NZPCs. Input resistance of IZPCs is increased over that measured in control cells (SPCs and NZPCs). Furthermore, the time course of the process of electrical restitution of action potential duration is altered in IZPCs with long action potentials. Finally, using K+-sensitive microelectrode techniques, we have determined that intracellular free K+ activity (aKi) in IZPCs (93.7 +/- 15 mM) is not significantly different from control aKi measurements (SPC, 106 +/- 13 mM; NZPC, 103 +/- 12 mM). Thus a reduction in aKi does not provide a basis for the reduced resting potentials observed in IZPCs. By studying the relation between the resting potential and log [K+]o we determined that in IZPCs with reduced resting potentials, there is a significant increase in the PNa/PK ratio when compared with control. In summary, to better understand the cellular basis of ventricular arrhythmias postinfarction, we have developed a single cell model that will allow for more rigorous electrophysiological studies of the specific ionic currents that underlie the abnormal electrophysiology.","Circulation research","2791230",1989,"United States"
"Contractile shortening response of ventricular cells to extracellular acidosis. Evidence for two-site control of H+-Ca2+ interaction.","The effect of extracellular acidosis on contraction of single isolated ventricular cells from rabbit was measured in a system in which pHo could be changed in less than 200 msec. The contractile response to acidotic levels was complete within 25 seconds. The response was measured 30 seconds after pHo was decreased to 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5 at each of 8 [Ca]o levels (0.125-4.0 mM). Cell shortening versus [Ca]o was plotted to construct a curve for each pHo level, with each point relative to shortening at pH 7.5, [Ca]o = 1 mM (100% value). Calcium current (1 mM [Ca]o) was also measured 30 seconds after pHo was decreased from 7.5 to 6.5 with single-cell patch clamp technique. The contractile response to extracellular acidosis is accurately predicted by assuming two (probably sarcolemmal) sites at which H+ ions affect calcium binding and/or flux: (equation; see text) The first factor represents a set of sites that are proposed to control access, dependent on the degree of their ionization, to sites represented by the second factor. The latter sites are proposed to accept calcium according to mass-action law. The response of calcium channel current to extracellular acidosis was also complete and reversible within 25 seconds. The current response indicates that the two-site model could be predictive for the effect of extracellular acidosis on calcium current in ventricular cells.","Circulation research","2791225",1989,"United States"
"The polarization of fibroblasts in early primary cultures is independent of microtubule integrity.","Fibroblasts in culture apparently require an intact system of microtubules in order to adopt and maintain a polarized morphology. In contrast, the polarization of a number of epithelial cell types has been shown to be microtubule-independent. Reconciliation of these apparently contradictory data is difficult, however, because the epithelial cells were studied in short-term primary cultures while the fibroblasts were studied in secondary or longer-term cultures. To clarify the situation we have examined the effects of the microtubule-disrupting drugs, colcemid and nocodazole, on the polarization of a single cell type, the chick heart fibroblast (HF), maintained in both primary (1 degree) and secondary (2 degree) cultures. Immunofluorescence observations of both types of culture showed that in control medium the cells contained abundant microtubules, which were absent if the cells were cultured in medium containing either colcemid or nocodazole. The effects of microtubule-disrupting drugs on the polarization of the cells were quantified using two measures of cell shape, elongation and dispersion, both of which increase with increasing polarization. The results show that microtubule-disrupting drugs do not have a significant effect on the polarization of HF spreading in 1 degree culture but significantly reduce the polarization of HF spreading in 2 degree cultures. The effects of microtubule disruption on HF that had been maintained in 1 degree culture for 6 h, 24 h or 48 h were also quantified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Journal of cell science","2693472",1989,"England"
"[Na] and [K] dependence of the Na/K pump current-voltage relationship in guinea pig ventricular myocytes.","Na/K pump current was determined between -140 and +60 mV as steady-state, strophanthidin-sensitive, whole-cell current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, voltage-clamped and internally dialyzed via wide-tipped pipettes. Solutions were designed to minimize all other components of membrane current. A device for exchanging the solution inside the pipette permitted investigation of Na/K pump current-voltage (I-V) relationships at several levels of pipette [Na] [( Na]pip) in a single cell; the effects of changes in external [Na] [( Na]o) or external [K] [( K]o) were also studied. At 50 mM [Na]pip, 5.4 mM [K]o, and approximately 150 mM [Na]o, Na/K pump current was steeply voltage dependent at negative potentials but was approximately constant at positive potentials. Under those conditions, reduction of [Na]o enhanced pump current at negative potentials but had little effect at positive potentials: at zero [Na]o, pump current was only weakly voltage dependent. At 5.4 mM [K]o and approximately 150 mM [Na]o, reduction of [Na]pip from 50 mM scaled down the sigmoid pump I-V relationship and shifted it slightly to the right (toward more positive potentials). Pump current at 0 mV was activated by [Na]pip according to the Hill equation with best-fit K0.5 approximately equal to 11 mM and Hill coefficient nH approximately equal to 1.4. At zero [Na]o, reduction of [Na]pip seemed to simply scale down the relatively flat pump I-V relationship: Hill fit parameters for pump activation by [Na]pip at 0 mV were K0.5 approximately equal to 10 mM, nH approximately equal to 1.4. At 50 mM [Na]pip and high [Na]o, reduction of [K]o from 5.4 mM scaled down the sigmoid I-V relationship and shifted it slightly to the right: at 0 mV, K0.5 approximately equal to 1.5 mM and nH approximately equal to 1.0. At zero [Na]o, lowering [K]o simply scaled down the flat pump I-V relationships yielding, at 0 mV, K0.5 approximately equal to 0.2 mM, nH approximately equal to 1.1. The voltage-independent activation of Na/K pump current by both intracellular Na ions and extracellular K ions, at zero [Na]o, suggests that neither ion binds within the membrane field. Extracellular Na ions, however, seem to have both a voltage-dependent and a voltage-independent influence on the Na/K pump: they inhibit outward Na/K pump current in a strongly voltage-dependent fashion, with higher apparent affinity at more negative potentials (K0.5 approximately equal to 90 mM at -120 mV, and approximately 170 mM at -80 mV), and they compete with extracellular K ions in a seemingly voltage-independent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","The Journal of general physiology","2607334",1989,"United States"
"Slow recovery of excitability and the Wenckebach phenomenon in the single guinea pig ventricular myocyte.","The cellular mechanisms of Wenckebach periodicity were investigated in single, enzymatically dissociated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, as well as in computer reconstructions of transmembrane potential of the ventricular cell. When depolarizing current pulses of the appropriate magnitude were delivered repetitively to a well-polarized myocyte, rate-dependent activation failure was observed. Such behavior accurately mimicked the Wenckebach phenomenon in cardiac activation and was the consequence of variations in cell excitability during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. The recovery of cell excitability during diastole was studied through the application of single test pulses of fixed amplitude and duration at variable delays with respect to a basic train of normal action potentials. The results show that recovery of excitability is a slow process that can greatly outlast action potential duration (i.e., postrepolarization refractoriness). Two distinct types of subthreshold responses were recorded when activation failure occurred: one was tetrodotoxin- and cobalt-insensitive (type 1) and the other was sensitive to sodium-channel blockade (type 2). Type 1 responses, which were commonly associated with the typical structure of the Wenckebach phenomenon (Mobitz type 1 block), were found to be the result of the nonlinear conductance properties of the inward rectifier current, IK1. Type 2 sodium-channel-mediated responses were associated with the so-called &quot;millisecond Wenckebach.&quot; These responses may be implicated in the mechanism of Mobitz type 2 rate-dependent block. Single-cell voltage-clamp experiments suggest that variations in excitability during diastole are a consequence of the slow deactivation kinetics of the delayed rectifier, IK. Computer simulations of the ventricular cell response to depolarizing current pulses reproduced very closely all the response patterns obtained in the experimental preparation. It is concluded that postrepolarization refractoriness and Wenckebach periodicity are properties of normal cardiac excitable cells and can be explained in terms of the voltage dependence and slow kinetics of potassium outward currents. The conditions for the occurrence of intermittent activation failure during diastole will depend on the frequency and magnitude of the driving stimulus.","Circulation research","2475274",1989,"United States"
"Electrical restitution and conduction intervals of ventricular premature beats in man: influence of heart rate.","Monophasic action potentials (MAP) were obtained from the outflow tract of the right ventricle during apical pacing in 20 patients with coronary artery disease. The electrical restitution was studied by interpolation of extrasystoles with various coupling intervals to the preceding steady-state beat at basic paced cycle lengths (CL) of 700, 600, and 500 msec. At higher frequencies the ventricular effective refractory periods (V-ERP) and duration of MAPs became shorter and the electrical restitution curves were displaced downwards (P less than 0.001). With increasing diastolic intervals preceding the extrasystole up to a maximum of 100 msec, the duration of premature MAPs increased at all frequencies. An obvious hump of the electrical restitution curve was observed at coupling intervals of 100 msec due to a later transient decrease (P less than 0.01) in duration of MAPs at the basic CL of 500 msec. No significant hump was observed at lower heart rates. Thus, a different time course of the electrical restitution was observed at various CLs. The intraventricular conduction intervals were shorter at the shorter basic CLs when compared to the 700 msec cycles (P less than 0.05). The conduction intervals were also modified by the coupling interval between the interpolated stimulus and the preceding steady-state action potential (AP). The premature beats elicited 30 msec or earlier after refractoriness were conducted more slowly at all basic cycle lengths (P less than 0.005), and those between 60 and 150 msec after the V-ERP more rapidly (P less than 0.01) than the steady-state beats. These observations have implications for the protocols used for introducing two or more frequencies during programmed stimulation in man. Furthermore, the conduction pattern in vivo cannot be interpreted from single cell studies.","Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE","2476758",1989,"United States"
"Cellular origins of the transient inward current in cardiac myocytes. Role of fluctuations and waves of elevated intracellular calcium.","Activation of the transient inward current (ITI) by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) is believed to be responsible for generating triggered cardiac arrhythmias. In this study, the cellular basis of the rise in [Ca2+]i that activates ITI and aftercontractions in single rat ventricular myocytes was examined. [Ca2+]i was measured both indirectly by cell contraction and directly with fura-2. Under conditions that caused steady-state [Ca2+]i to increase (i.e., calcium overload) membrane repolarization after a voltage-clamp depolarization resulted in the appearance of ITI that was similar in many respects to that observed in multicellular preparations. This ITI occurred at the same time that [Ca2+]i spontaneously increased and preceded the aftercontraction by 60-90 msec. However, ITI recorded from a single cell was variable in time course and amplitude (unlike that observed in multicellular preparations). Examination of cell contraction and digital imaging of fura-2 fluorescence showed that ITI was often associated with propagating regions of increased [Ca2+]i, which arose from discrete sites of origin within the cell. Apparently synchronous aftercontractions could also be associated with multiple propagating waves of [Ca2+]i. The variation in the time course and amplitude of ITI in single cells appeared to be due to changes in the location and number of sites of origin for the waves of [Ca2+]i. After the first aftercontraction and ITI, desynchronization of the sites of origin of increased [Ca2+]i occurred, and this resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of ITI and an increase in its duration. We conclude that the variability seen in single cells arises from changes in the pattern of spontaneous Ca2+ release. Such phenomena will seriously complicate interpretation of multicellular data, even when [Ca2+]i is measured directly.","Circulation research","2736729",1989,"United States"
"Erythrocyte deformability in patients on left ventricular assist systems.","Preliminary hemorheologic studies using clinical filtration techniques on blood cell suspensions have suggested that changes in erythrocyte (RBC) deformability occur during left ventricular assist system (LVAS) support. In the biophysics literature, it is generally accepted that the elastic properties of the RBC membrane complex affect the microcirculatory deformability of the whole cell (cytoplasmic pathologies excepted). This paper compares single cell measurements of the surface shear elastic modulus, mu, of the RBC membrane complex (determined using micropipette aspiration) to available clinical filtration pressure data during Novacor LVAS support, over 33 and 126 days in four patients.","ASAIO transactions","2597578",1989,"United States"
"Modification of cardiac action potential by photosensitizer-generated reactive oxygen.","Evidence implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in reperfusion-induced arrhythmias is accumulating rapidly [1,2]. However, surprisingly little is known about the effects of ROS on cardiac electrophysiology. Such knowledge would improve our understanding of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. Photosensitizers and light are known to produce a variety of ROS. They might, therefore, be useful for investigating oxygen-mediated cell injury. To our knowledge, such an approach has not been used to investigate ROS-induced alterations in the electrophysiological properties of cardiac muscle. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate (1) the feasibility of using photosensitizers for such an investigation, and (2) some advantages photosensitizers offer when combined with single cell and patch pipette methodologies. A comparison of the electrophysiological alterations produced by photosensitizer-generated ROS to the reported effects of xanthine-xanthine oxidase or organic hydroperoxides suggests that the electrophysiological alterations produced by superoxide initiated reactions and/or lipid peroxidation are similar to those produced by photosensitizers and light.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","2778806",1989,"England"
"Cardiac and respiratory correlations with unit discharge in human amygdala and hippocampus.","Animal studies have shown that epileptiform seizures can cause cardiac arrhythmias and death. The amygdala and hippocampus are implicated in epileptogenesis and autonomic and respiratory control. We examined cardiac and respiratory correlations with single cell discharge in hippocampus and amygdala of patients with epilepsy. We recorded respiration, ECG, and neuronal discharge of amygdala and hippocampus from patients undergoing chronic depth electrode monitoring. Cross-correlation histograms were used to test for neuronal discharge timing relationships with inspiration or the ECG. Inspiratory time, respiratory period and heart rate were calculated for each breath, and linear regression was used to test for correlations with tonic unit rate. Of 183 cells from 24 patients, 20% had cardiac timing relationships and 23% showed tonic correlations with changes in heart rate. Only 2% had timing relationships with the respiratory cycle, while 15% showed tonic rate relationships with respiratory period. Recording sites did not differ in mean discharge rate or proportion of cells showing these correlations. These results indicate that a significant number of human forebrain cells show discharge modulation by the cardiac cycle and discharge rate correlation with changes in respiration and heart rate. This is supportive of animal models designed to explore the role of mesial temporal lobe structures in regulation of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, although a lower proportion of cells in human temporal lobe showed timing relationships with respiration and there was no clear evidence of anatomic specificity between amygdala and hippocampus.","Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology","2471614",1989,"United States"
"Characterization of single heart cell contractility by rapid imaging.","1. A rapid imaging technique with temporal resolution of about 1 ms was employed to describe cell-length changes during the isotonic contraction cycle of adult rat ventricular myocytes at 22 degrees C. 2. Parameters of cell contraction and relaxation were defined and values obtained under control conditions and after treatment with 5 mumol/L verapamil. 3. Over 15 min, verapamil dramatically reduced the maximum shortening attained. This was associated with delay in both excitation-contraction coupling latency and the time at which maximum rate of shortening occurred. However, peak shortening was recorded earlier in the contraction cycle. Total cell-cycle time was abbreviated under the influence of verapamil and maximum rates of shortening and lengthening were depressed in a similar manner. 4. The results highlight the value of improved temporal precision in describing myocyte contractility and validate the use of the parameters defined in the single-cell model for the study of the mechanisms of action of cardiotonic agents.","Clinical and experimental pharmacology &amp; physiology","2721030",1989,"Australia"

A case report.","A cytomegalovirus seronegative 9 year-old child, affected by terminal dilated cardiomyopathy, underwent cardiac transplantation and received the heart of a cytomegalovirus seropositive donor. After the positive outcome of an acute moderate rejection episode which was treated with steroids, the patient developed an infectious clinical syndrome with cytomegalovirus seroconversion and virus isolation from peripheral blood leukocytes. The 5th endomyocardial biopsy showed a typical cytomegalovirus-like nuclear inclusion in a single cell. In spite of specific treatment with (9-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy)methyl-guanine) (BW B759U) (Wellcome), the patient died 45 days after the operation from cytomegalovirus-induced interstitial pneumonia and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome.","Giornale italiano di cardiologia","2550305",1989,"Italy"
"The hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor selectively binds to some endogenous tissues.","The hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) was isolated from various rat tissues or freshly prepared single cell suspensions and tested for the binding to endogenous tissues or specific cell types by indirect immunofluorescence. Inhibition with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine demonstrated specificity of binding. ASGP-R binds to mesodermal tissues and to selected cells of the majority of glandular tissues but not to lining epithelia. ASGP-R stains heart muscle but not skeletal muscle. In addition, ASGP-R stains spleen cells (52%), bone marrow cells (55%), thymocytes (62%), and a fraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes (29%), which was identified as B-lymphocytes. Five different rat tumors also showed binding of ASGP-R. The binding pattern and staining intensity of peanut agglutinin and soybean agglutinin were strikingly different although the binding specificity of these lectins is related to the ASPG-R. It is concluded that considerable numbers of endogenous binding sites for the hepatic ASGP-R exist in normal tissue, even on cells which pass the liver on circulation.","European journal of cell biology","2663495",1989,"Germany"
"Immunofluorescence detection of digoxin with monoclonal digoxin specific antibody.","The present study primarily focuses on the analysis of digoxin binding of the heart muscle cells. The primary aim of the investigation was to demonstrate the cardiac glycoside morphologically. The direct immunofluorescence staining technique with digoxin specific monoclonal antibody or Fab fragments and FITC or Texas-Red conjugated antisera are useful for morphological demonstration of digoxin binding and localization in cardiac cells. With the immunofluorescence method, linkage can be observed on the sarcolemma membrane and on the wall of capillaries and arterioles in myocardial cells treated by cardiac glycoside. The specificity of reaction is provided by the negative reaction of cells, not treated by digoxin. Intensity of reaction depends on concentration. The photometric measuring of fluorescence enables the quantitative analysis of cardiac glycoside. It shows the sensitivity of the method in that cardiac glycoside linked to the cell membrane can be detected in the upper sphere of a therapeutic dose. Application of the immunofluorescence method is manifold and relatively simple, and this quick method can be used in diagnoses and in the study of cardiac glycoside receptors of cell membrane. On the basis of our own experiments it is possible to study the kinetics of digoxin linkage. The use of this method is demonstrated for investigation of single cell suspension and cryostat sections.","Acta medicinae legalis et socialis","2520729",1989,"Germany"
"[Analysis of membrane current system involved in the inotropic effects mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors in the heart].","In order to clarify the underlying mechanism of the inotropic effects mediated by alpha-adrenoceptor, changes of electrophysiological properties induced by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation were investigated in rat and guinea-pig ventricular muscles. In the presence of atenolol (10 microM), phenylephrine increased dose-dependently the developed tension in rat papillary muscles. The time course of the positive inotropic effect produced by phenylephrine (10 microM) consisted of an initial transient positive inotropic phase, followed by a negative inotropic phase and then, a second positive inotropic phase. Phenylephrine also prolonged action potential duration (APD) and increased resting membrane potential (hyperpolarization). The APD prolongation was coincident with the positive inotropic phase, and the hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential developed with the negative inotropic phase and maintained irrelevantly to the following positive inotropic phase. The inotropic and electro-physiological responses by phenylephrine was blocked by prazosin (0.1 microM), but not by yohimbine (0.1 microM), indicating that the changes were mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Nifedipine (3 microM) abolished the positive inotropic effect and attenuated the APD prolongation. However, nifedipine failed to affect the negative inotropic effect and the hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarization was also observed in the quiscent muscles, and abolished by pretreatment with barium ion (0.5 mM), suggesting the increased potassium premeability by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. In the single cell voltage-clamp experiments, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation was found to increase calcium current (ICa) and to decrease transient outward current (Ito). The changes of both currents explain the APD prolongation and the positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors. Protein Kinase C (C-Kinase) is suggested to be one of candidates for intracellular signal transduction systems during alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. However, TPA, a stimulator of C-Kinase, failed to increase Ica, although it increased the delayed outward current (IK) in guinea-pig single cell, indicating that C-Kinase activation by alpha-adrenoceptors stimulation was not related to the positive inotropic effect. These results suggest that the ponitive inotropic effect mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors is evoked by an increase in Ica and a decrease in Ito, and the negative inotropic effect is related to the resting membrane potassium permeability. Both electro-physiological changes constitute the triphasic inotropic effect mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors in rat cardiac muscles.","[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science","2853693",1988,"Japan"
"Myocyte deenergization and intracellular free calcium dynamics.","Intracellular free calcium in adult rat heart ventricular myocytes was monitored by single cell fura-2 fluorescence microscopy. The average resting free calcium in rod-shaped quiescent cells was 125 nM (range 70-200 nM). When cells were deenergized with an inhibitor (amytal) and an uncoupler (carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) of oxidative phosphorylation, there was a small but significant increase (125-380 nM) in intracellular free calcium during the transition to a highly contracted (square) rigor form. After the onset of contracture, which occurred 5-15 min after addition of the above compounds, the increase in free calcium was slow for the first 20 min, reaching a value of only 750 nM. Thereafter, the rate of increase accelerated and 50 min after contracture, free calcium was approximately 3 microM. The increase in free calcium was absolutely dependent on extracellular calcium but was not inhibited by high concentrations of verapamil (2-7 microM), suggesting influx via the Na+-Ca2+ exchange transporter as the cause of calcium increase. However, in calcium repletion protocols the rate of increase in sodium-loaded myocytes was greatly accelerated if cells were not depleted of ATP, confirming suggestions that ATP loss partially inhibits Na+-Ca2+ exchange.","The American journal of physiology","3407762",1988,"United States"
"Computerized evaluation of drug-induced changes in guinea-pig epicardial monophasic action potentials.","The monophasic action potential (MAP) has been widely used for the study of drug effects on cardiac repolarization in vivo. There is, however, no study of drug-induced effects on MAP depolarization, i.e. effects on MAP Vmax and/or MAP rise-time. For this study, we developed a method in the anesthetized open chest guinea-pig. MAP signals were recorded and subjected to on-line computerized analysis, in which parameters describing both depolarization and repolarization were calculated. With the MAP electrode kept at the same epicardial position the MAP rise-time did not vary with time. If the influences of heart rate were eliminated, the intra- and interindividual variation in the MAP duration was very low. Sotalol significantly and dose-dependently prolonged MAP duration, but did not affect rise-time, whereas tocainide significantly and dose-dependently shortened MAP duration and increased rise-time. The effect of tocainide on rise-time is most likely secondary to a reduction in conduction velocity due to a decrease in Vmax in the single cell action potential. These results suggest that monophasic action potential recordings coupled with an on-line computerized analysis may be used for rapid and simple evaluation of drug effects, both on cardiac depolarization and repolarization.","Pharmacology &amp; toxicology","3141912",1988,"Denmark"
"Contractile force of single heart cells compared with muscle strips of frog ventricle.","Single heart cells were obtained from frog ventricle with an enzymatic dispersion technique. Isometric contractile force was measured in these cells by an ultrasensitive force transducer and compared with that generated by multicellular muscle strips under similar conditions. The shape of the single-cell twitch was qualitatively similar to that obtained in intact tissue; however, the time to peak was generally shorter, and the falling phase was prolonged in the single cell compared with the muscle strip. The single-cell contractile force was measured in response to alterations in stimulus rate, resting length, and extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]o or by addition of epinephrine; in all cases, the force response resembled the physiological response seen in the muscle strip. However, at a constant stimulation rate, the steady-state amplitude of the single-cell twitch exhibited beat-to-beat variations under all conditions tested, whereas that of the muscle strip was essentially constant. These results may prove to be useful in assessing the suitability of the single-cell preparation as a model for the intact tissue.","The American journal of physiology","3260753",1988,"United States"
"Single cell analysis of transfected gene expression in primary heart cultures containing multiple cell types.","Transfection experiments involving mixed cell cultures pose special problems because of differential uptake and expression of DNA by different cell types. In order to evaluate the expression of transfected DNA in primary cultures of embryonic myocardial cells, we have used immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) on a single cell basis. The results show that myocardial cells take up and express transfected DNA approximately 7 times less efficiently than non-myocardial cells. The immunofluorescence analysis allows the biochemical level of CAT activity expressed under control of different transcriptional promoters to be compared on a cell type by cell type basis. Thus, the relative transcriptional strength of two promoters can be estimated for a specific cell type within a heterogeneous population of cells.","BioTechniques","3078720",1988,"United States"
"In vitro culture and maintenance of trophoblastic vesicles: Observations on the development of contractile structures with concurrent vessel development.","The use of trophoblastic vesicles as a model for the study of maternal recognition of pregnancy, embryo development and cell to cell interaction has increased in recent years. In this report, we describe the long-term culture of trophoblastic vesicles derived from enzymatically dispersed porcine blastocysts. Day 12 to 14 porcine embryos were enzymatically dispersed to form single cell suspensions, then allowed to plate in 25 cm(3) tissue-culture flasks. Vesicles formed 3 to 14 d following plating and ranged in size from 0.1 to 4.0mm in diameter. Vesicles larger than 1.5 mm at formation were able to float free in the medium for up to 65 days, at which time vesicles were histologically sectioned. Contractile elements formed in association with dense cell areas, and were found with tubular vascular vessels. Movement of cells that resembled eosinophilic cells was observed in the vessels and pulsed in synchrony with contractions of the primitive heart. Histological examination gave evidence of primitive blood cells and cardiac tissue, and no evidence of neural tissue was found, indicating the probability that the contractions were induced by permeable membrane depolarization. It is hypothesized from the observations reported in this paper that the cell differentiation required to form the contractile region and the vessel are under the control of the dense cell area. This indicates that trophoblastic vesicles fromed by the enzymatic dispersal of porcine blastocysts is a possible model for the study of induced cell differentiation and formation of the cardiac organ system in vitro.","Theriogenology","16726408",1988,"United States"
"Functional pacemaking area in the early embryonic chick heart assessed by simultaneous multiple-site optical recording of spontaneous action potentials.","Pacemaking areas in the early embryonic chick hearts were quantitatively assessed using simultaneous multiple-site optical recordings of spontaneous action potentials. The measuring system with a 10- X 10- or a 12 X 12-element photodiode array had a spatial resolution of 15-30 microns. Spontaneous action potential-related optical signals were recorded simultaneously from multiple contiguous regions in the area in which the pacemaker site was located in seven- to nine-somite embryonic hearts stained with a voltage-sensitive merocyanine-rhodanine dye (NK 2761). In the seven- to early eight-somite embryonic hearts, the location of the pacemaking area is not uniquely determined, and as development proceeds to the nine-somite stage, the pacemaking area becomes confined to the left pre-atrial tissue. Analysis of the simultaneous multiple-site optical recordings showed that the pacemaking area was basically circular in shape in the later eight- to nine-somite embryonic hearts. An elliptical shape also was observed at the seven- to early eight-somite stages of development. The size of the pacemaking area was estimated to be approximately 1,200-3,000 micron2. We suggest that the pacemaking area is composed of approximately 60-150 cells, and that the pacemaking area remains at a relatively constant size throughout the seven- to nine-somite stages. It is thus proposed that a population of pacemaking cells, rather than a single cell, serves as a rhythm generator in the embryonic chick heart.","The Journal of general physiology","3392520",1988,"United States"
"Blast colonies containing hemopoietic progenitor cells can give rise to Abelson virus (A-MuLV)-transformed cell lines.","We have established an in vitro system with which to examine the ability of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) to infect early hemopoietic progenitor cells. Blast cell colonies containing less than 100 cells were shown to contain up to 85% of cells with secondary hemopoietic colony-forming ability. Infection of cells from these blast colonies resulted in generation of transformed mast cell lines when a feeder was provided. Morphological examination of cells taken from infected cultures at various times postinfection indicated a progression of cellular differentiation to the mast cell lineage. Southern analysis on early subclones of transformed cells from two wells, using a v-abl specific probe, indicated a unique pattern of viral integration amongst subclones, suggesting that all subclones had derived from a single cell in each well. Similar results were observed with helper-free Abelson virus obtained by transfecting psi 2 cells with P160 A-MuLV proviral DNA. These data indicate that hemopoietic progenitor cells can be infected by A-MuLV and subsequently in our in vitro culture condition give rise to transformed mast cell lines.","Experimental hematology","2446900",1988,"Netherlands"

Information on the pacemaker mechanism in cardiac tissue has been greatly enhanced by the development of the single cell isolation technique and the patch clamp technique. These methods circumvent to a large extent the difficulties involved in voltage clamping multicellular preparations. The calcium current (ICa), delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), transient outward current (Ito;IA), and the hyperpolarization activated inward current (Ih or If) were found both in whole cell preparations and in single channel analysis. The physiological significance of these currents, together with the exchange current systems for the pacemaker depolarization are discussed.","Experientia","2446905",1987,"Switzerland"
"Electrophysiologic aspects of moricizine HCl.","Moricizine HCl, a phenothiazine derivative, is a new antiarrhythmic drug that has quinidine-like effects on the myocardium. Moricizine HCl, 1 X 10(-7) g/ml, significantly decreases Vmax of the transmembrane action potential of canine Purkinje fibers and reduces the duration of the action potential at 50% and 90% of repolarization, whereas resting potential is unchanged. The drug decreases the fast inward sodium current (lNa), as measured by the double sucrose gap technique in frog atrium trabeculae; the processes of activation, inactivation and reactivation of current did not change even when a high concentration of drug (5 X 10(-6) g/ml) was used. At the same dose, the slow inward calcium current (lCa) increased, but the total outward current did not change. Using the patch-clamp technique, it was shown that moricizine HCl, 1 X 10(-4) g/ml, did not alter single-channel conductance, but essentially decreased the mean open tonic and open-state probability of potassium channels either at positive or negative holding potentials. lNa measured in a single myocyte preparation decreased faster when drug was administered in the external bath compared with intracellular injection. Moricizine HCl action on lNa of the single cell and on Vmax of the action potential is frequency dependent. When lNa was recorded directly, there was a cumulative effect of drug. Similar to other quinidine-like agents, moricizine HCl enhanced arrhythmogenicity within the first few minutes after coronary artery occlusion, but prevented arrhythmias 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","The American journal of cardiology","3310582",1987,"United States"
"Sequential or single pulse defibrillation? Investigations towards energy reduction in experimental animals.","With introduction of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for treatment of medically refractory ventricular arrhythmias, many investigations are focussing on possibilities of reducing the energy necessary for defibrillating the heart to obtain a more adequate size and a longer durability of the generator. Several studies favour the sequential pulse delivery, using three electrodes, either endocardial, epicardial or subcutaneous plates, to improve defibrillation performance of low energy shocks. However, the validity of this conclusion remains equivocal since two different electrode configurations were used for single and sequential defibrillation. In the present study the influence of sequential pulse delivery, pulse sequence and resultant current pathways on defibrillation energy requirements were examined in comparison with single-shocks between the same epicardial electrode configuration as well as four orthogonally positioned patches. The energy requirement for 100% efficiency could be reduced by sequential pulsing with a time interval of 1 msec thus yielding significant superiority compared to single pulse defibrillation using three electrodes. The same reliable defibrillation and reduced threshold has been obtained by using four electrodes and one single shock. The addition of a third electrode alone had no influence on the energy requirements. Therefore, we have to discuss a different electrophysiological mechanism for sequential defibrillation than for single shocks with an extended current distribution over the heart using four electrodes. Possibly the action potential of the single cell of the fibrillating heart is of interest in reflecting the efficiency of sequential pulse defibrillation. By influencing the action potential pharmacologically in some animals, the optimal time interval for double shocks could be extended up to 7 msec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon","2447668",1987,"Germany"
"Rationale for the in vitro study of neuromuscular activity.","Exercise requires the integrated activity of neuromuscular systems controlling skeletal, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle. However, exercise can be defined at the most basic cellular level. Therefore, in order to effectively study the specific cellular events involved in the activity of each system, it is necessary to first isolate and control the major neurogenic, myogenic, and humoral components of neuromuscular activity. For example, these components of activity are differentially involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptors. The increased concentration of intracellular free calcium during contraction (an event classified as a myogenic component of activity), rather than trophic factors from the motoneuron (neurogenic component) and hormonal factors (humoral component), is a major regulator of acetylcholine receptor expression. The degree of experimental control increases as one progresses from the experimental approaches involving the exercising human to the single cell studied in vitro. It has been possible only by cell culture techniques to identify specific intracellular messengers, e.g., calcium, that mediate the effect of neuromuscular activity on acetylcholine receptor expression. The wide variety of in vitro techniques now available permit the selection of appropriate models. Therefore, the use of various in vitro methods by exercise physiologists seems justified. In vitro methods provide a valuable dimension to the study and understanding of neuromuscular activity in the intact organism.","Medicine and science in sports and exercise","2446103",1987,"United States"
"Isolation, long-term culture, and ultrastructural characterization of adult cardiomyopathic cardiac muscle cells.","A long-term cell culture system for adult cardiomyopathic hamster cardiac muscle cells has been established. The diseased and control hearts were dissociated into single cell suspension with the modifications of our previous technique using collagenase and hyaluronidase as applied to the dissociation of the adult rat heart. The postperfusion of the diseased heart with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer and bovine serum albumin was very helpful in obtaining greater yield of viable diseased muscle cells; the cells were cultured for 4 wk. Approximately 60% of the myocytes from the diseased heart and 85% of the myocytes from the normal heart attached to the substrates and survived throughout the culture period. Approximately 60 to 70% of the cardiac myocytes from the diseased and control hearts were bi- or multinucleated; 30% of the diseased and 80% of the normal myocytes showed rhythmic contractility. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of two kinds of cardiac muscle cells in the diseased cell culture on the basis of their myofibril content: one with scanty myofibrils and another with abundant myofibrils. Myocytes with sparse myofibrils showed certain characteristic features that included autophagic vacuoles, amorphous matrix of fine filamentous texture, scattered strips of myofibrils, and abnormal organization of the Z-line. Cardiac muscle cells with abundant myofibrillar content contained unorganized myofibrils in certain sarcomeres. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining diseased cardiac muscle cells from adult cardiomyopathic hamsters for at least 4 wk in monolayer culture.","In vitro cellular &amp; developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture Association","3571099",1987,"United States"
"Peculiarities of adriamycin cardiotoxicity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).","The adriamycin (ARD) effects on the myocardium and the microcirculatory system (m.s.) of the heart and the skeletal muscle were studied enzyme histochemically and histomorphometrically. Normotensive Wistar rats (ADR-NWR) and SHR (ADR-SHR) were given 3 weekly intravenous injections of 1 mg ADR/kg b.wt. Controls were injected with saline. Besides the well-known ADR-induced single-cell degeneration observed in both strains, ADR-SHR have developed focal myocardial lesions (f.m.l.) to be characterized as ischemic alterations. Their number and size have distinctly increased as compared to saline-treated SHR. In the coronary m.s. the ADR applications were followed by signs of structural adaptation to chronic contractions, especially in ADR-SHR and within the f.m.l. The latter were considered to be decisively engendered by the pathological reactions of the m.s. In ADR-SHR possible the cardiotoxic ADR actions have aggravated these microvessel reactions and their consequences.","Biomedica biochimica acta","3435516",1987,"Germany"
"Calcium channel blocking properties of amlodipine in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle in vitro: evidence for voltage modulation of vascular dihydropyridine receptors.","Amlodipine was twice as potent as nifedipine at inhibiting Ca2+-induced contractions in depolarised rat aorta (IC50 1.9 nM vs. 4.1 nM) but, unlike nifedipine, displayed a very slow onset of action. Contractions induced by depolarising steps with 45 mM K+ were much less potently blocked by amlodipine (IC50 19.4 nM), whereas the potency of nifedipine was little changed (IC50 7.1 nM). This difference may be explained by a modulated receptor hypothesis, similar to that described for cardiac muscle, in which block of vascular calcium channels by dihydropyridines is enhanced at depolarized membrane potentials, such voltage-dependence only being apparent with a slow-acting drug such as amlodipine. Recovery from amlodipine block of K+-responses in rat portal vein after drug washout was also very slow. Amlodipine and nifedipine blocked phenylephrine-induced contractions of the rat aorta with potencies similar to those against depolarisation-induced responses. Negative inotropic potencies of amlodipine and nifedipine in perfused guinea pig hearts were approximately one-tenth those against Ca2+-induced contractions in rat aorta. Amlodipine caused complete block of guinea pig papillary muscle single-cell slow action potentials at a concentration (5 microM) that had no effect on upstroke velocity of normal, fast potentials but reduced the duration of the plateau phase.","Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology","2434785",1987,"United States"
"Electrical properties and response to noradrenaline of individual heart cells isolated from human ventricular tissue.","The analysis of the electrical properties and response to catecholamines of cardiac tissue is greatly simplified by the use of single cell preparations. In this study individual cells isolated from human ventricular tissue were used to estimate cellular sarcolemmal resistance and capacitance and to record the time course of the response to ionophoretically applied noradrenaline. The mean input capacitance of the cells is consistent with a surface membrane area of approximately 15,000 micron2 if the specific membrane capacitance is 1 microF X cm-2. This is larger than might be expected from the measured external dimensions of the cell and is compatible with the presence of surface membrane infoldings and caveolae. At membrane potentials close to -75 mV the mean cell input resistance was approximately 40 M omega, giving a specific membrane resistance of 6 omega X cm2 if mean membrane area is 15,000 micron2 and consistent with the assumption that the isolated cells have sealed intercalated discs under the experimental conditions used. Ionophoretically applied noradrenaline produced a pronounced prolongation of the plateau phase of the action potential, but this effect developed over many seconds. The slow onset of action is not compatible with the kinetics of free extracellular diffusion of catecholamine but may reflect molecular events that occur between noradrenaline binding to membrane receptors and the final cellular response. Under voltage-clamp conditions, the cells showed a time dependent inward current consistent with the rapid activation and decay of a sarcolemmal calcium conductance.","Cardiovascular research","3802123",1986,"United States"
"Voltage-tension relations in single frog atrial cardiac cells.","Voltage-clamp experiments were performed on isolated single frog (Rana catesbeiana or Rana pipiens) atrial cells to determine the voltage-contraction relations of the single cardiac cell. The contractile responses of the single cell associated with long duration (3 second) depolarizing steps consisted of a rise to peak (phasic) followed by a decay to a sustained contraction (tonic). These phasic-tonic type contractile responses could be obtained under conditions where membrane potential was well controlled along the entire length of the cell. Thus, the data obtained on the single cell indicate that the phasic-tonic contractile response is the characteristic contractile response of frog atrial tissue. The voltage dependence of the extent of relaxation to the tonic component following the peak of the contraction was affected dramatically by the intracellular sodium concentration. This result indicates that both the relaxation following peak contraction as well as the tonic contraction are related to calcium control via the sodium-calcium exchanger. The data also indicate that calcium entry via the inward calcium current is required for the contractile response to have a phasic component. These data indicate that calcium entry via the inward calcium current followed by the sodium-calcium exchanger first reducing and then maintaining the intracellular calcium level produces the characteristic phasic-tonic contractile response.","Circulation research","2431806",1986,"United States"
"Deposition of the terminal C5b-9 complement complex in infarcted areas of human myocardium.","Poly- and monoclonal antibodies to neoantigens of the human C5b-9 complement complex, as well as polyclonal antibodies to C5, C8, and C9, were used to detect and identify C5b-9 deposits in human myocardial tissue. Immunocytochemical studies were performed on fresh-frozen autopsy material derived from patients with myocardial infarctions; in addition, in 17 of these patients, paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tissue were investigated. Sixteen autopsies from patients with noncardiac diseases were analyzed as controls. Without exception, C5b-9 positivity was registered selectively and exclusively on and in myocardial cells located within the zones of infarction. The selectivity of staining was confirmed by control reactions for succinic dehydrogenase activity performed in adjacent, respective double-stained sections. Most intensive staining with anti-neoantigen antibodies was observed in the peripheral areas of the infarctions. Weak staining for C3d, rather strong staining for C5 and C9, and intermediate staining with anti-C8 antibodies were observed in the same localizations. Stainings for C4 and IgA were negative, whereas immunocytochemical reactions for IgG and IgM revealed an irregular and very weak staining. Only very weak staining was also observed with a monoclonal antibody to complement S-protein, indicating that the terminal complement components were deposited mainly in the form of membrane-damaging C5b-9 complexes. Immunocytochemical staining for C5b-9 was found to represent a most sensitive tool for detection of ischemic myocardial lesions, permitting easy detection even of single cell necroses. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that initial ischemia may cause loss of the ability of the heart muscle cells to regulate complement turnover at the membrane level. The resulting deposition of C5b-9 on the cell membranes may contribute to functional disturbance and irreversible damage of myocardial cells during the infarction process.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","3528291",1986,"United States"
"Mechanism of action of acetylcholine on calcium current in single cells from frog ventricle.","Ca currents (ICa) were measured by whole-cell patch clamp in single cells isolated from frog ventricle in which K currents were blocked with intracellular (120 mM) and extracellular (20 mM) Cs. Inward currents elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -80 mV were blocked completely by 0.5 mM-Cd. The quality of the voltage clamp was assessed using two patch electrodes on a single cell. One electrode was used in the voltage-clamp mode to measure membrane currents and the other in current-clamp to measure membrane potential. Ca currents as large as 2 nA were well clamped in cells as long as 210 micron. Acetylcholine (ACh) had no effect on ICa in the absence of beta-adrenergic stimulation but reduced to control levels ICa elevated by isoprenaline. Nanomolar concentrations of ACh were able to reduce significantly ICa elevated by 2 microM-isoprenaline. ACh had no effect on the shape of the I-V curve, on the reactivation (recovery from inactivation), or on the inactivation of ICa. Although isoprenaline increased ICa by an average of 6.5-fold, it had no effect on the shape of the I-V curve or on the inactivation at test potentials negative to +40 mV. However, isoprenaline slowed the half-reactivation time from a control value of 120 +/- 10 ms (mean +/- S.D.) to 153 +/- 12 ms at -80 mV. The effect of cyclic AMP on ICa was investigated using two patch electrodes, one filled with cyclic AMP. Maximal effects of cyclic AMP were observed with 5 microM-cyclic AMP in the pipette. Maximal ICa was recorded several minutes after breaking the patch with the second electrode. After removing the cyclic-AMP-containing electrode, ICa declined to control levels after approximately 10 min. 5 microM-cyclic AMP in the patch electrode increased ICa by an average of 6.9-fold, but had no effect on the shape of the I-V curve or on inactivation. Cyclic AMP had a slowing effect on reactivation (half-reactivation time = 155 +/- 24 ms) similar to that of isoprenaline. ACh (1-10 microM) did not reduce ICa elevated with cyclic AMP (0.1-20 microM-cyclic AMP in the pipette). With low concentrations of cyclic AMP in the pipette (0.1 microM), isoprenaline augmented ICa, but with 5 microM-cyclic AMP in the pipette, isoprenaline was incapable of increasing ICa further. These results suggest that the decrease of ICa produced by ACh can be explained solely by decreases in cyclic AMP levels.","The Journal of physiology","2432231",1986,"United States"
"[New knowledge in the biochemistry and function of ion channels].","Newer realizations concerning the structure and the function of various forms of ion canals are described. The Na- and K-ion channels occur in a particularly great number in certain membrane regions of nerve cells and muscle fibres and cause the formation and distribution of bioelectric signals. In the K-ion channels various types with different function appear in  single cell forms. The Ca-ion channels play a role in the regulation of the release of neurotransmitters and of peptide hormones from granules as well as in the contraction of the heart and skeletal musculature. The ion channels are constructed by various proteins, in certain sections they specifically bind certain toxins and medicaments. The acetyl choline receptor consists of 5 subunits and acts as ion channels for Na- and K-ions; this is opened for a short time after binding of 2 molecules of acetyl choline to the alpha-subunits. The properties of the channel proteins are influenced by phosphorylation.","Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete","2424184",1986,"Germany"
"Modification of the discharge of lateral geniculate neurons during visual learning.","Visually conditioned heart rate change in the pigeon has been developed as a vertebrate model system for cellular analysis of associative learning. Previous studies have characterized the behavior, largely delineated the neural circuitry mediating the conditioning, and estimated the central processing time for the conditioned response. Most recently, this system has been used to investigate neuronal activity during conditioning along the visual pathways that transmit the conditioned stimulus (CS) information. It was first shown that neither maintained nor CS-evoked discharge of retinal ganglion cells changes during conditioning. Subsequently, we found that the thalamic and telencephalic components of the ascending tectofugal pathway show associative modification. We report here studies of the thalamofugal pathway, the avian homolog of the mammalian geniculocortical system. Single-cell activity was recorded in the thalamic relay of this pathway, the dorsal lateral geniculate equivalent (LGNe). This provided an opportunity to evaluate the generality of the training-induced modification found along the tectofugal pathway, and to determine if such modification occurs as peripherally as retinorecipient neurons. The results show that almost all LGNe neurons (97%) respond phasically to the onset of whole-field illumination. Most (94%) also respond to the unconditioned stimulus (US), footshock, some with increased and others with decreased discharge. Of cells receiving convergent input, those responding with decreased discharge to the US showed associative change (52%). Neurons that did not respond to both the CS and US, or that responded to the US with increased discharge, did not show associative modification. These findings suggest that the visual pathways transmitting CS information are not merely input lines, but undergo training-induced modification; such modification can occur as peripherally as the retinorecipient neurons of these pathways; and CS-US convergence is necessary but not sufficient for associative modification, since modifiability is apparently contingent on specific US response properties.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","3958787",1986,"United States"
"A study of intracellular calcium oscillations in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres measured at the single cell level.","Previous work has shown that an elevation of intracellular calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) produces spontaneous oscillations of [Ca2+]i. However the fact that the oscillations are unsynchronized between different cells has made it difficult to study them. We have therefore injected only one cell in a Purkinje fibre with aequorin in order to avoid these problems. The addition of strophanthidin (10 microM) produced an increase of mean aequorin light over the course of several minutes. During this period spontaneous oscillations of light developed and, with time, their frequency and magnitude increased. The oscillations could first be seen at levels of [Ca2+]i of less than 1 microM. The amplitude of the oscillations of [Ca2+]i could be up to 10 microM and was modulated at a slow rate (about 0.3-0.5 Hz). This suggests that, even within one cell, different regions may oscillate at different frequencies. Elevating [Ca+]o, removing extracellular Na+, or depolarization increased the magnitude of the aequorin light oscillations. Converting the records to [Ca2+]i showed that this increase in the magnitude of the aequorin oscillations was accompanied by a real increase of mean [Ca2+]i and of the magnitude of the oscillations [Ca2+]i. The frequency of the oscillations increased up to a point but saturated at a maximum value of 3-4 Hz. Since previous experiments have used the mean aequorin light to estimate mean [Ca2+]i, we have calculated the error produced in this calculation by the presence of [Ca2+]i oscillations. We estimate that the error is greatest at low levels of Ca2+ loading when the frequency of the oscillations is low. However, at higher Ca2+ loads, when the frequency is above 2 Hz, the error is probably less than 10%. If oscillations were produced by removal of external Na+ after the application of strophanthidin, then either ryanodine or caffeine abolished the oscillations. Furthermore, in both cases, the resulting steady level of [Ca2+]i was similar to the mean level before the addition of the drugs. In another series of experiments we examined the effects of these drugs on oscillations produced by the application of strophanthidin. Caffeine produced a transient increase in both the frequency of the oscillations and mean [Ca2+]i before abolishing the oscillations and decreasing [Ca2+]i to below the level in the absence of caffeine. In contrast ryanodine gradually decreased both the mean [Ca2+]i and the frequency until the oscillations were abolished. During this period of slowing of the oscillations their magnitude was often increased.","The Journal of physiology","3723418",1986,"United States"
"A comparative electrophysiological study of enzymatically isolated single cells and strips of frog ventricle.","Single heart cells were obtained from frog ventricle using an enzymatic dispersion technique. The whole cell variation of the patch clamp technique was used to monitor action potential and cell membrane currents. The clamp circuit could be switched electronically between voltage and current clamp modes. The effects of seal leakage currents were to depolarize the cell, reduce the amplitude of the plateau, and lengthen the action potential duration. A scheme to compensate for these currents is presented. The membrane currents obtained from the single cell under voltage clamp conditions were compared to those obtained from multicellular preparations using the single sucrose gap technique. Hyperpolarizing clamps showed time-dependent, depletion-related K+ currents for the multicellular preparation, whereas for the single cell no such currents were observed. The absence of extracellular accumulation or depletion of K+ in the single cell was confirmed by the lack of post-clamp afterpotentials or changes in resting potential following a train of frequently elicited action potentials. The TTX-insensitive inward current was relatively faster in the single cell, compared to that measured in the multicellular preparation. A delayed time-dependent outward current was observed in the positive potential range for both single and multicellular preparations. The isochronal current-voltage (I-V) relations obtained at 400 ms were N-shaped for both preparations, but was more negative for the single cell at potentials positive to -20 mV. The results indicate a strong similarity between membrane currents obtained in single and multicellular preparations. The differences in the currents in the two preparations are due in large part to accumulation or depletion of K+ in the extracellular space.","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","2415918",1985,"United States"
"Influence of thyroid hormone levels on the electrical and mechanical properties of rabbit papillary muscle.","We have examined the influence of chronic in vivo alterations of thyroxine levels on the electrophysiological and mechanical properties of rabbit ventricular papillary muscles measured in vitro. Marked changes in the repolarization phase of the action potential and the time to peak tension of isometric twitches were observed when thyroid hormone levels were increased above or decreased below normal. The time to peak tension was consistently shorter than normal in hyperthyroid and longer than normal in hypothyroid preparations. In hypothyroid preparations the action potential duration was greater than that of controls at all stimulation frequencies tested (0.1 to 1.0 Hz). In hyperthyroid preparations, the repolarization phase consisted of an initial phase of fast repolarization to membrane potential values between -20 and -40 mV followed by a plateau. The early phase of repolarization persisted at all stimulation frequencies tested (0.1 to 1.0 Hz) but the plateau component increased markedly as the stimulation frequency was decreased. The early phase of repolarization was markedly reduced in the presence of 4-aminopyridine. These results suggest that thyroxine levels may modulate the kinetics of a transient outward current which in rabbit papillary muscle normally is responsible for the frequency dependence of action potential duration. Action potential amplitude, maximum rate of rise, resting membrane potential, and peak isometric twitch tension were not markedly different between the three classes of preparations. A second depolarizing response occurred in all hyperthyroid preparations at low stimulation frequencies (0.1 to 0.4 Hz) but not in control or hypothyroid preparations. This second depolarizing response, which was eliminated by D-600 treatment, was similar to the calcium-dependent slow action potentials recorded in other cardiac preparations. These two component action potentials could represent either intrinsic single cell activity, or a re-entry wave of depolarization which results from nonhomogeneous excitation.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","2987515",1985,"United States"
"Simultaneous measurements of action potentials and contractions in single cultured adult and embryonic heart muscle cells.","Using both a microphotometrical technique and conventional microelectrodes, excitation and contractions have been measured simultaneously in spontaneously active and electrically driven isolated cultured heart muscle cells of embryonic chicks as well as adult rats and guinea-pigs. This experimental arrangement makes it possible to measure continuously and with high accuracy, excitation and E.C. coupling at the single cell level. The contraction time course of spontaneously active embryonic cells and electrically driven adult cells resembles contractions of macroscopic heart muscle preparations against various preloads; mostly a nearly isometric contraction form is found. The effects of various inotropic factors on excitation and contraction (beat frequency, Ca, epinephrine) were studied and it could be shown that the embryonic cells show different features of E.C. coupling. The activity of adult cells resembles very strongly that characteristically found in macroscopic preparations. This proved the feasibility of the method in studies of cardiac E.C. coupling at the single cell level.","Basic research in cardiology","2581543",1985,"Germany"
"Phenotype and histological distribution of interstitial dendritic cells in the rat pancreas, liver, heart, and kidney.","The phenotype and the histological distribution of interstitial dendritic cells was investigated in the rat pancreas, liver, heart, and kidney by immunoperoxidase techniques. Monoclonal antibodies, directed against lymphocyte differentiation antigens (W3/25, W3/13, and Ox8) or against Ia antigens, revealed distinct phenotypes of these cells in all organs investigated--namely W3/25+Ia- dendritic cells, W3/25+Ia+ cells, and a small W3/25-Ia+ population. In the kidney cortex a W3/25+W3/13+ population was additionally shown. Interestingly, the phenotypically distinct cell populations also differed in their topographical distribution: W3/25+Ia+ cells were evenly scattered in the interstitium of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, heart, and kidney. In contrast, W3/25+Ia- cells showed an additional predilection for connective tissue septa in the exocrine pancreas and for the kidney medulla. In the liver, phagocytic Kupffer cells were W3/25+Ia-, whereas the W3/25+Ia+ nonphagocytic dendritic cell population resided periportally and around central veins. These results show a marked heterogeneity of interstitial dendritic cells in the rat, which is discussed in terms of different cell lines or different activation or maturation stages of one single cell type.","Transplantation","6380042",1984,"United States"
"Single cardiac Purkinje cells: general electrophysiology and voltage-clamp analysis of the pace-maker current.","Single Purkinje cells from dog, sheep and cow hearts were isolated by injecting a Ca-free collagenase containing Tyrode solution in the space between the connective tissue sheath and the Purkinje cells. A small proportion of these cells survived the isolation procedure and these cells were used for further investigation. The cells showed electrophysiological properties similar to intact Purkinje fibres as indicated by the following results. Maximum diastolic potentials between -70 and -85 mV and specific membrane resistances of 21-32 k omega cm2 indicated that the single cells were not leaky or hyperpermeable . The action potential showed a rapid upstroke, with a maximum rate of rise, Vmax' between 150 and 750 V/s, and two phases of fast repolarization separated by a plateau phase with a duration of about 200 ms. Each action potential was followed by a spontaneous depolarization with an amplitude between 1 and 10 mV. The upstroke of the action potential could be blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in a dose-dependent manner. The rate of depolarization of the action potential was sensitive to changes in membrane potential; the resulting S-shaped curve showed a half-maximum potential of -65 mV and a steepness of 0.46 mV-1. The duration of the action potential was sensitive to external K concentrations, catecholamines and TTX in a way similar to intact Purkinje fibres. Both application of catecholamines and lowering the external K concentration induced spontaneous activity. The cells were used to study the ionic nature of the pace-maker current under voltage-clamp conditions using the two-micro-electrode technique. This pace-maker current was blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by 1 mM-Cs, and was not affected by 1 mM-Ba. The steady-state activation curve was shifted in the depolarizing direction by application of adrenaline. In contrast to voltage-clamp data obtained on the pace-maker current of intact Purkinje fibres, the pace-maker current in a single cell did not reverse near the presumed equilibrium potential for K ions; no reversal could be seen in the voltage range negative to -50 mV. These observations together with preliminary results on the Na and K dependence of the pace-maker current are strong arguments in favour of the hypothesis that the pace-maker current in cardiac Purkinje fibres is an inward current carried by Na and K ions and activates upon hyperpolarization.","The Journal of physiology","6737305",1984,"England"
"Regeneration of myocardial cells. Observation in aneurysmectomized ventricular wall.","A small necrotic focus with regeneration of myocardial cells in an aneurysmectomized ventricular wall was observed in a 46-year-old man. Marginating the area of necrosis were myocardial cells with mitosis, with frequent multinucleated and binucleated cells. In the area of necrosis, there was a proliferation of many round, oval to polygonal cells with a high mitotic activity. These cells had eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and one prominent nucleus. Some cells were solitary while others clustered in and around the damaged myocardial fibers. Some cells formed a syncytium and were attached to the perimysial tubes with protoplasmic extensions. These proliferated cells are believed to be a single-cell line and to originate from the damaged myocardial cells. This observation suggests that human myocardial cells may regenerate continuously from surviving myocardial cells and proliferate discontinuously.","Archives of pathology &amp; laboratory medicine","6546666",1984,"United States"
"Effect of tetrodotoxin on the inward ionic current of the guinea pig atrium.","The inward ionic current in the atrium has been measured by electronic differentiation of the voltage, time signal, on the assumption that the single cell penetrated by the micro-electrode shows cable-like properties. The method exploits fully information contained in the upstroke of the action potential, and an internally consistent set of parameters can be derived. Tetrodotoxin was found to reduce the fast inward ionic current, and to shift the voltage of maximum current flow to more negative values. TTX augmented the effects of high stimulation rates but did not alter the refractory period of the atrium. It is suggested that TTX interacts with the Na+ channel so as to reduce activation of the Na+ current and hence unit conductance. The present results are consistent with the apparent voltage-dependence of TTX action, since activation and inactivation of the Na+ current are both voltage-sensitive phenomena.","Cardiovascular research","6325003",1984,"England"
"Electrophysiology of single cardiac cells.","Whatever techniques of isolation one may use, it is certainly true that the isolated single heart cells are very useful in various physiological experiments. For electrophysiology, the application of the single cell serves to test findings previously obtained in the multicellular preparation. Therefore, summary and comparison of the data will become necessary in the near future. Furthermore, the application of the single cell opens new areas for electrophysiology of the heart, because when using only the single cell preparation, one can dialyse intracellular millieu and can also measure single channel analyses.","The Japanese journal of physiology","6092750",1984,"Japan"
"Propagation through electrically coupled cells. Effects of regional changes in membrane properties.","The normal process of excitation of the heart involves propagation of action potentials through cardiac regions of different anatomy and different intrinsic membrane properties. Although our understanding of these properties is still incomplete, it is well accepted that the parameters measured from a single cell penetration in an electrical syncytium (e.g., action potential duration, rate of rise, and velocity) reflect not only the properties of that cell but also the electrotonic interactions with other cells to which the recorded cell is electrically coupled. We have used simulation techniques to predict the spatial distribution of action potential parameters resulting from discretely localized alterations in the intrinsic membrane properties of some of the cells of an electrical syncytium. We have shown that the resulting spatial distribution is markedly different for alterations in plateau and pacemaker currents vs. rising phase currents, and that other factors, such as the site of stimulation and the underlying spatial pattern of cell-cell coupling resistance, also modify the spatial distribution of action potential properties resulting from a discrete regional change in intrinsic membrane properties.","Circulation research","6627611",1983,"United States"
"Effects of glucose on the transmembrane potential of hypoxic canine ventricular muscle fibers.","Since the introduction of glucose-insulin-potassium therapy for acute myocardial infarction 20 years ago, there have been many attempts to determine the efficacy of this treatment. Some trials have shown that this therapy is antiarrhythmic and others have found no benefit. In this study we demonstrate that concentrations of glucose found to be antiarrhythmic in recent clinical trials exert favorable effects on resting membrane potential, overshoot, and rising velocity in hypoxic canine heart cells. The refractory period, shortened by hypoxia, is also significantly lengthened by extra glucose. All of these single-cell effects are potentially antiarrhythmic and may explain the effectiveness of this therapy.","American heart journal","6613811",1983,"United States"
"Epidermal growth factor and glucagon receptors in mice homozygous for a lethal chromosomal deletion.","The binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and of glucagon to their receptors has been examined in single-cell suspensions obtained from livers and other organs of newborn mice homozygous for a perinatally lethal deletion that includes the albino (c) locus on chromosome 7. Competition experiments with 125I-labeled and nonradioactive EGF and Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data showed that hepatocytes from deletion homozygotes had only approximately equal to 20% of the number of specific EGF receptors present in cells from normal littermates. In contrast, EGF binding to single-cell suspensions from organs other than the liver was normal in deletion homozygotes. Similar results were obtained in competitive displacement experiments with 125I-labeled and nonradioactive glucagon: hepatocytes from deletion mutants showed only approximately equal to 30% of the specific glucagon binding sites found in cells from normal littermates. As in the case of EGF, the decreased binding was due to decreased numbers of glucagon receptors per cell rather than alterations in receptor affinity, and glucagon binding to single-cell suspensions from organs other than the liver was normal in the deletion mutants. The reductions in numbers of EGF and glucagon receptors are liver-cell specific as are the previously described ultrastructural and biochemical abnormalities in these mutants. The significance of cell membrane integrity and hormone-receptor interactions in the control of normal liver cell differentiation is discussed.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","6310574",1983,"United States"
"Norepinephrine-stimulated hypertrophy of cultured rat myocardial cells is an alpha 1 adrenergic response.","We have shown recently that norepinephrine stimulates muscle cell hypertrophy in primary cultures from the neonatal rat ventricle and that this stimulation is not blocked by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The present study was done to define the adrenergic specificity of the myocyte hypertrophic response to norepinephrine. 90% pure, single-cell cultures of nongrowing myocytes were maintained in serum-free medium 199 with transferin and insulin. Myocyte size was quantitated 48 h after addition of adrenergic agents, by measuring cell volume, cell surface area, and cell protein. L-norepinephrine increased myocyte size to a maximum 150% of control; half-maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 0.2 microM. This increase in cell size was inhibited by the nonselective alpha adrenergic antagonist phentolamine and by the alpha 1 adrenergic antagonists prazosin and terazosin; it was not inhibited by propranolol or by the alpha 2 adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol did not increase cell size. Thus, norepinephrine-stimulated hypertrophy of cultured rat myocardial cells is an alpha 1 adrenergic response.","The Journal of clinical investigation","6135712",1983,"United States"

"Long-term cell culture of adult mammalian cardiac myocytes: electron microscopic and immunofluorescent analyses of myofibrillar structure.","Adult rat heart was dissociated into a single-cell suspension by a retrograde perfusion technique with collagenase and hyaluronidase in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. Long-term culture of these isolated single cardiac muscle cells was established for up to 45 days. Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis with monoclonal antibodies to cardiac myosin were used to examine sequentially the external and internal structural organization of the cardiac myocytes. Most of the cardiac myocytes exhibited prominent alterations in their external and internal structural organization during the first two weeks of culture. As they attached to the substrate and spread out, the myocytes assumed various shapes and sizes, with the exception of a few which maintained their original cylindrical shape. Electron microscopy of 2 to 4-day cultures revealed that most of the muscle cells contained disorganized myofibrils and surface blebs with enclosed mitochondria and myofilaments, which were eventually extruded from the cytoplasm. With progressive culture, the cardiac myocytes appeared to lose myofibrillar material; fewer myofilaments or sacromere fragments with interfibrillar mitochondria were observed in the sarcoplasm. Such cells resembled cultured embryonic or neonatal cardiac myocytes. However, some muscle cells retained closely packed, well organized myofibrils characteristic of freshly dissociated or in vivo cardiac myocytes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the cultured cardiac myocytes were strongly myosin positive throughout their morphological changes and subsequent maintenance in culture. Two patterns of fluorescence were observed in these cells in correlation with the fine structural evidence for myofibrillar distribution. One pattern exhibited bright fluorescence near the central region of the cell with a more weakly diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm; the other pattern was characterized by bright fluorescence throughout the sarcoplasm. Most of the myocytes retained their contractility throughout the culture period excepting the initial 24 to 48 h of cell attachment and flattening. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining contractile cardiac muscle cells from adult rats for at least 1 1/2 months in monolayer culture, although some variability in myofibrillar organization has been observed.","Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology","6350610",1983,"United States"
"Cardiac hypertrophy in rats after supravalvular aortic constriction. II. Inhibition of cellular autophagy in hypertrophying cardiomyocytes.","Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were killed by retrograde perfusion fixation 3, 7, 14, 21 and 35 days after supravalvular aortic constriction (n = 33) or sham-operation (n = 25). Subepicardial specimens of the left ventricular myocardium were evaluated by conventional electron microscopic morphometry, and in addition were examined for the occurrence of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) using large test areas (3.9 X 10(4) micron 2 per animal). The quotient of mitochondrial to myofibrillar volume fraction was largely unchanged during hypertrophy but was reduced by 25% compared with controls after termination of growth at 35 days. During the process of hypertrophy which eventually led to an increase in average single cell volume of the cardiomyocytes by 78%, the volume fraction and the numerical density of AVs was significantly lower than in sham-operated rats. The most striking difference was observed 7 days after the operations, the stage at which the growth rate of the cardiomyocytes relative to controls was at its maximum of 4.5% per day. At this point the volume fraction as well as the numerical density of AVs were reduced by about 50% compared with controls. At 14 and 21 days after operation, when the relative growth rate of the hypertrophying cardiomyocytes was still 2% and 1% per day, the AV volume fraction was reduced to a lesser extent (by 47% and 28%, respectively). After termination of adaptive growth at 35 days significant differences in fractional volume and numerical density of AVs were no longer detectable. These results suggest that degradation of cytoplasmic components is inhibited in cardiomyocytes undergoing hypertrophy.

"Cardiac hypertrophy in rats after supravalvular aortic constriction. I. Size and number of cardiomyocytes, endothelial and interstitial cells.","The ascending aorta of 22 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats was constricted with a silver ring, and 25 animals were subjected to a sham-operation. The hearts, including the main arteries, were fixed by retrograde perfusion 3, 7, 14, 21 and 35 days after the operation. The cross-sectional area of the aorta was reduced by the constriction to an average of 20% of the values found after sham-operation. Twenty-one days after the constriction the weight of the left ventricular myocardium including the septum was increased 1.7-fold compared with controls. No further increase in weight was observed 35 days after the operation. The relative volumes of the tissue components remained largely constant in the subepicardial myocardium. In the subendocardial myocardium, however, the volume fraction of interstitial and, to a lesser extent, of endothelial tissue was significantly increased. Twenty-one days after constriction the estimated total volumes of the different myocardial components per left ventricle were increased 1.7-fold for heart muscle parenchyma, 1.8-fold for endothelial tissue, 2.9-fold for interstitial tissue, and 1.3-fold for capillary lumina compared with controls. At 35 days, only the interstitial tissue showed a further increase to 4.8-fold of control values. The mean cardiomyocyte volume was increased after aortic constriction in proportion to the increase in left ventricular weight, i.e. 1.7-fold over controls at 21 days. After 35 days its value was 29,500 +/- 790 micron 3 in rats subjected to aortic constriction compared with 16,800 +/- 640 micron 3 in controls. At this time the estimated number of cardiomyocytes per left ventricle showed no significant differences between experimental animals (2.9 X 10(7)) and controls (3.1 X 10(7)). Endothelial and interstitial cells were not only increased in average single cell volume (1.3-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively), but also in number per left ventricle (1.4-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively). Two-dimensional parameters indicated that during hypertrophy the capillary supply lagged behind the overall mass increase but achieved control levels on termination of hypertrophic growth at 35 days. These results show that even in pronounced hypertrophy the increase in mass of the myocardial parenchyma in the rat is due exclusively to an enlargement of cardiomyocytes (hypertrophy), whereas in endothelial and interstitial tissues enlargement of cells as well as increase in cell number (hyperplasia) also plays a role.","Virchows Archiv.

"Myocyte hypertrophy in neonatal rat heart cultures and its regulation by serum and by catecholamines.","The role of hormones and other humoral factors in the regulation of myocardial hypertrophy has been difficult to evaluate. We asked whether myocardial cell hypertrophy could be demonstrated in cultures from the day-old rat ventricle and evaluated the effect of serum concentration and catecholamines on the growth process. Two single-cell preparations were used: serum-supplemented, bromodeoxyuridine-treated cultures and serum-free cultures with transferrin and insulin. Both preparations were characterized by myocardial cell predominance (about 75--80% of total cells) and constant cell numbers. Myocardial cell size was documented by photomicroscopy and quantified by volume (microscopic diameter of suspended cells), surface area (planimetry of attached cells), and total cell protein concentration (Lowry method and cell counts). Growth was also evaluated in pure nonmyocardial cell cultures. In cultures with 5% (vol/vol) serum, myocardial cell size increased 2- to 3-fold over 11 days in culture. Final volume, surface area, and protein concentration were about 3000 micrometer3/cell, 5000 micrometer2/cell, and 1500 pg/cell, respectively. Serum had a dose-related effect on myocardial cell hypertrophy; myocardial cell size increased about 4-fold when serum concentration was increased from 0% to 5% or 10%. Cells maintained in serum-free medium with transferrin and insulin (each 10 microgram/ml) did not hypertrophy, but did remain responsive to the growth-promoting activity of serum. Chronic exposure to isoproterenol or norepinephrine (1 microM) significantly stimulated myocardial cell hypertrophy. This stimulation was dose-related, was not blocked by equimolar propranolol, was not associated with a sustained chronotropic effect, and was more pronounced in the serum-free preparation. In pure cultures of nonproliferating (bromodeoxyuridine-treated) nonmyocardial cells, cell size also increased with time in culture, but variation in serum concentration and addition of norepinephrine had no significant effect on cell size. Myocardial cell hypertrophy occurs in culture and is regulated by variations in the culture medium, including serum, with its contained hormones and growth factors, and catecholamines. The culture preparation can be used to explore the regulation of myocardial cell hypertrophy by nonhemodynamic factors.","Circulation research","6216022",1982,"United States"
"Rat cardiac muscle single cell automaticity responses to alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists.","Isolated cardiac muscle cells from neonatal rat ventricular myocardium have both alpha- and beta-adrenergic, positive chronotropic responses, with sensitivity to applied adrenergic agents more than 100 times greater than the intact neonatal heart. These highly sensitive isolated single cells and small groups of cells also reveal partial agonist activity of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, and the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. The most likely explanation for the high sensitivity is the lack of a desensitization process that could involve both a desensitization substance and changes in receptors. These experiments suggest that all adrenergic antagonists could possibly show partial agonist activity.","Circulation research","6127171",1982,"United States"
"Demonstration of the tumorigenicity of transformed rat kidney cell-lines by intravenous allotransplantation in the neonate.","The tumorigenic potential of allogeneic rat kidney cell-lines transformed in vivo by a carcinogenic dose of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) was investigated by intravenous injection of single cell suspensions into neonatal outbred rats within 24 h of birth. The cell-lines tested included mesenchymal populations obtained from DMN-induced renal mesenchymal tumors (RRMT-2,-8,-9) and transformed mesenchymal (TRKM-5,-7,-8) and epithelial (TRKE-1) cell-lines derived from the kidneys of rats treated only hours previously with the carcinogen. Additionally, spontaneous nephroblastoma-derived embryonal cell-lines (REN-1,-2) were included in the study to extend the potential of the neonatal rat system over a range of differentiation lineages. The transplantation system proved to be a rapid and efficacious assay for demonstrating the malignancy of the mesenchymal and embryonal cell-lines. The major sites for tumor growth were the lungs, heart and eye, but differences in organ predilection were observed for individual cell-lines. The transformed epithelial cell-line (TRKE-1) proved refractory to the single intravenous inoculation but was transplantation-positive when a follow-up subcutaneous dose was administered several days later. The resultant growths produced by the diverse differentiation lineages were histologically characteristic for the tumor tissue affiliate of each cell-line. The results demonstrate the utility of this transplantation system for testing the malignant potential of morphologically transformed cells across the allogeneic barrier as well as proving that DMN is capable of inducing malignant transformation in both mesenchymal and epithelial cell types of the rat kidney after a very short period of exposure in vivo.","International journal of cancer","7129674",1982,"United States"
"Pluripotential hemopoietic stem cells in adult mouse brain.","Single cell suspensions of adult mouse brain were shown to contain large numbers of pluripotential hemopoietic stem cells as detected by the ability to form hemopoietic colonies in the spleens of irradiated hosts. These colony forming unit, spleen (CFU-s) cells derived from brain gave rise to colonies identical in morphology and histology to those of bone marrow-derived CFU-s. The average number of CFU-s obtained per 10(5) dissociated adult brain cells was 14, whereas other adult tissues such as lung, kidney, heart, and thymus contained insignificant CFU-s levels when tested. As the level of CFU-s in adult blood is less than 1 per 10(6) nucleated cells, blood contamination does not contribute to the high levels found in adult brain. Individual spleen colonies isolated from irradiated CBA (H-2k) recipients injected with (BALB/c x CBA)F1 (H-2d x H-2k) brain cells were shown by immunofluorescence to contain cells bearing surface H-2d molecules, thus indicating that the colonies arose from the brain cell inoculum and were not endogenously derived. The surface phenotype of brain- and bone marrow-derived CFU-s was found to differ in that brain CFU-s could be inhibited by prior incubation with a monoclonal antibrain antibody B2A2, whereas bone marrow CFU-s were not. Further differences were found between brain and bone marrow CFU-s in the congenitally anemic Wf/Wf mice. These mice were shown to have a very few CFU-s in the adult bone marrow, whereas the brain contained normal adult levels. The large number of hemopoietic stem cells in the brain may indicate an essential requirement for the continual generation of cells such as microglia or phagocytic cells, without the disruption of the blood-brain barrier.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","6953426",1982,"United States"
"A simple method for preparing single cell suspensions of heart and smooth muscle for radioreceptor labeling studies.","A simple method of preparing single cell suspensions for radioligand binding studies is described. The method involves incubating tissues in the presence of collagenase and elastase for 90 min in physiological solution with 1 mM calcium chloride and the mechanical disruption of the tissue by pipetting.

"Intracellular recordings from the stellate ganglion of the cat.","1. Intracellular recordings were made, in vitro, and in situ, from neurones of the cat stellate ganglion. 2. Preganglionic stimulation, in vitro, via the T3 ramus or post-ganglionic stimulation via the ventral ansa, dorsal ansa or stellate cardiac nerve evoked graded synaptic responses which led to the discharge of one or more action potentials. Since the conduction velocities of fibres converging onto a single cell may vary, their convergence may mean that there is an interaction in the stellate ganglion between functionally different pathways. 3. Most neurones in the stellate ganglion receive synaptic input from fibres of both central and peripheral origin. 4. Intracellular recordings were made, in situ, from neurones of the cat stellate ganglion attached via the stellate cardiac nerve to the rest of the animal. When peripheral sympathetic afferent input to the stellate ganglion was increased by occluding the descending aorta, some of the neurones exhibited an increase in excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) and/or action potentials. Most of the synaptic input recorded from the ganglion cells in situ had a close relationship with the cardiac cycle and/or respiration. 5. These data and our previous studies support the contention that sympathetic efferent nerve activity can be modified by peripheral excitatory inputs and that these neural connexions may function as pathways for a peripheral reflex at the level of the paravertebral ganglion.","The Journal of physiology","7097602",1982,"England"

"Ultrastructure of the heart of the marine mussel, Geukensia demissa.","The structure of the heart of Geukensia demissa, a common object of physiological and biochemical investigation, is described by scanning, transmission and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. A single-cell epithelial layer covers the ventricle, but an endothelium is lacking. Myofibers are small (6-7 ¦Ìm diam.), mononucleate, and tapered. Glycogen is concentrated peripherally. Mitochondria are particularly concentrated under the sarcolemma, near the ends of the nucleus, and in rows between bundles of myofilaments. The myofilaments (6-8nm thin, 30-35 nm thick filament diam.) are loosely arranged into sarcomeres (2-4 ¦Ìm) by Z bodies. Many of these Z bodies interconnect, and some anchor to the sarcolemma forming attachment plaques. Cells are joined by intercalated discs consisting of fascia adherentes, spot desmosomes, and gap junctions. The gap junctions include intramembrane particles. T tubules are absent. The sarcolemma is coupled to the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (JSR) over 357ndash;40% of the cell surface. Tubules extend from the JSR deep into and throughout the cell as an irregularly dispersed network. The SR occupies 1% of the cell volume. A few, small (0.1-1.0 ¦Ìm) unmyelinated nerves are present, but no neuromuscular junctions were seen. The auricles have fewer and smaller myocytes than the ventricle. The auricles also contain podocytes with pedicels having 20-35 nm slits and containing sieve-like projections. The morphology of the Geukensia heart is similar to that of other bivalves.","Journal of morphology","30153711",1981,"United States"
"[Evidence for the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in heart contractile cells].","Using 3H-labelled glucocorticoids, the receptor activity of heart and liver cytosol preparations from various animal classes and species, the distribution of receptors in the myocardium from different divisions of rat heart and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in the myocyte preparations isolated from adult rat hearts after treatment of cardiac tissue with hyaluronidase and collagenase have been studied. The specific binding of 3H-dexametasone to bovine fetal heart endothelial cells as well as to some other cell cultures was investigated. The data obtained suggest that the bulk of the total receptor activity of the heart is accounted for contractile cells of the myocardium. The number of specific sites of glucocorticoid binding by whole myocyte cells (per 1 mg of protein) or by &quot;crude nuclear fraction&quot; (per 1 mg of DNA) is comparable to that for some other cell types, which are believed to be hormone-sensitive. However, by the number of receptors per single cell myocytes surpass all the other cell types under study.","Biokhimiia (Moscow, Russia)","7317526",1981,"Russia (Federation)"
"Hypercapnia and hypoxia: chemoreceptor-mediated control of locus coeruleus neurons and splanchnic, sympathetic nerves.","Utilizing single cell recording techniques to study brain norepinephrine (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) and, in the same rats, registration of splanchnic nerve activity (SNA) the effects on these systems of hypercapnia and hypoxia, respectively, were studied. Hypercapnia (pCO2 36-103 mm Hg) caused a rapid increase in the firing rate of LC neurons as well as in SNA. This effect was directly correlated with the added amount of CO2 in the  inspired gas mixture. This finding indicates a similar chemo-receptor-mediated regulation of LC neurons and SNA. Since deafferentation of peripheral chemoreceptors did not alter the response of these systems to hypercapnia, the chemoreceptors involved must be centrally located. In hypoxia (pO2 105-31 mm Hg) the overall effect on LC neurons was activation, whereas SNA was reduced. These effects were, however, not dose-dependent. Peripheral receptor deafferentation abolished the activation by hypoxia, suggesting that the LC neurons are influenced also by peripheral chemoreceptors. The results indicate that the previously observed increase in brain NE turnover in hypercapnia is largely secondary to increased neuronal activity and not due to, e.g., changes in metabolic enzymes. In addition, the data implicate chemoreceptors, centrally but also peripherally located, in the regulation of brain NE neurons in the LC. The activation of these neurons in hypercapnia, generally associated with increased apprehension in man, is consistent with the notion that the LC may serve as an alarm system in the brain.","Brain research","6793212",1981,"Netherlands"
"[From the ameba to the pulsating heart: evolution and fine structure of the intracellular movement apparatus (author's transl)].","Different kinds of cell motility are reviewed in this paper with special regard to development and ultrastructure. The variety of animal cell motility types can be reduced to three principles : ciliary and ameboid movements and muscle contraction. The ultrastructure of all kinds of cilia is very similar from single cell organisms to highly specialized cells of the human body e.g., ciliary respiratory epithelium. As a rule, ciliary movement is caused by minimal sliding of the nine double tubules consisting of tubulin, a protein differing from myosin and actin. Ameboid movement and muscle cell contraction are based on the sliding filament mechanism of actin and myosin. Although the principles of this mechanism have not changed during evolution some differences in the structure and arrangement of actin and myosin filaments occurred. Obviously, the high degree of order of the myofibrils of vertebrate heart and skeletal muscle cells has developed from loose and rapid changing arrangement of contractile filaments in ameboid cells. There are some changes of residues in the actin and myosin molecules during the development of the intracellular contractile system. Finally, some peculiarities of the myocardium, its special arrangement of muscle cells and some disturbances of the contractile filaments under pathologic conditions are discussed.","Klinische Wochenschrift","7197313",1981,"Germany"
"Active and passive electrical properties of single bullfrog atrial cells.","Single cells from the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) atrium have been prepared by using a modification of the enzymatic dispersion procedure described by Bagby et al. (1971. Nature [Long.]. 234:351--352) and Fay and Delise (1973. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 70:641--645). Visualization of relaxed cells via phase-contrast or Nomarski optics (magnification, 400--600) indicates that cells range between 150 and 350 micrometers in length and 4 and 7 micrometers in diameter. The mean sarcomere length in relaxed, quiescent atrial cells in 2.05 micrometer. Conventional electrophysiological measurements have been made. In normal Ringer's solution (2.5 mM K+, 2.5 mM Ca++) acceptable cells have stable resting potentials of about -88 mV, and large (125 mV) long-duration (approximately 720 ms) action potentials can be elicited. The Vm vs. log[K+]0 relation obtained from isolated cells is similar to that of the intact atrium. The depolarizing phase of the action potential of isolated atrial myocytes exhibits two pharmacologically separable components: tetrodotoxin (10(-6) g/ml) markedly suppresses the initial regenerative depolarization, whereas verapamil (3 x 10(-6) M) inhibits the secondary depolarization and reduce the plateau height. A bridge circuit was used to estimate the input resistance (220 +/- 7 M omega) and time constant 20 +/- 7 ms) of these cells. Two-microelectrode experiments have revealed small differences in the electrotonic potentials recorded simultaneously at two different sites within a single cell. The equations for a linear, short cable were used to calculate the electrical constants of relaxed, single atrial cells: lambda = 921.3 +/- 29.5 micrometers; Ri = 118.1 +/- 24.5 omega cm; Rm = 7.9 +/- 1.2 x 10(3) omega cm2; Cm = 2.2 +/- 0.3 mu Fcm-2. These results and the atrial cell morphology suggest that this preparation may be particularly suitable for voltage-clamp studies.","The Journal of general physiology","6973007",1981,"United States"
"Characteristics of sarcomere shortening in single frog atrial cardiac cells during lightly loaded contractions.","We studied sarcomere performance in single isolated intact cardiac cells using techniques that allow direct measurement of sarcomere length and force. This investigation dealt primarily with sarcomere performance during twitch contractions under lightly loaded conditions. In such contractions, there was a significant portion of the contraction in which sarcomere shortening occurred at constant velocity over a significant range of sarcomere lengths. The constant velocity phase of shortening was followed by a phase of shortening in which sarcomere velocity decreased markedly. Both the velocity and extent of sarcomere shortening depended on the stimulus parameters used to excite the cell. With threshold stimulation, sarcomere velocities during the constant velocity phase of shortening ranged from 1 to 5.5 micron/sec in different cells and significant slowing of sarcomere shortening began at sarcomere lengths of 1.8-2.0 micron. In contrast, when cells were stimulated with a long duration stimulus (200 msec) of large current strength, sarcomere velocities during the constant velocity phase ranged from 6 to 12 micron/sec, and significant slowing did not occur until a sarcomere length of about 1.6 micron was reached. The threshold stimulus strength-stimulus duration relationship was determined on the single cell, and it was found to be of the type expected for a cell having an intact excitable membrane capable of generating an action potential when depolarized to a fixed voltage threshold. The data presented in this paper give direct evidence that the lightly loaded cardiac sarcomere has a velocity of shortening which depends on the level of contractile activation but is independent of sarcomere length at sarcomere lengths greater than about 1.6 micron.","Circulation research","6970091",1981,"United States"

"Membrane changes induced by early myocardial ischemia in the dog.","Sarcolemmal and mitochondrial phospholipids were extracted from normally perfused and ischemic regions of the dog heart and the composition of these extracts was analyzed. Relatively pure sarcolemmal fraction obtained from myocardium subjected to 3 h of ischemia exhibited a significantly lower concentration of phospholipids than that obtained from normal myocardium. In particular, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were reduced by approximately 33%. The fatty acid content in the sarcolemmal phospholipid fraction was also reduced by approximately 30% without any change in the relative composition. In the mitochondrial fraction, the relative phospholipid composition was also altered by ischemia; the major components (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin) being reduced by approximately 15-20%. An attempt was made to correlate these biochemical changes with ultrastructural lesions observed electron microscopically. These observations revealed extensive regional variability and a wide heterogeneity in the extent of ultrastructural damage evident in the different organelles even in a single cell. This may suggest that ischemic damage, in the early stages, may advance at widely varying rates in different regions. Our findings demonstrate that significant biochemical and structural disorganization occurs during 3 h of ischemia in the myocardium and raise the possibility that one of the initiating events is the activation of sarcolemmal and mitochondrial phospholipases.","Canadian journal of biochemistry","7459675",1980,"Canada"
"A reliable and sensitive method to localize terminal degeneration and lysosomes in the central nervous system.","After reconsidering the physicochemical mechanisms involved in the so-called degeneration methods for the demonstration of axons and nerve terminals, the method of Eager was fundamentally modified in order to stabilize the staining process. This resulted in a simple and reliable method which stains degenerating terminals and lysosomes with a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity. Frozen sections 30 to 50 micrometers thick are prepared from material fixed with formaldehyde by cardiac perfusion. The staining procedure consists of 5 steps: 1) alkaline pretreatment (pH 13), 2) silver impregnation, 3) washing, 4) development at pH 5.0-5.5 monitored by an indicator, and 5) washing in acetic acid. Possible faults can be easily detected by their specific effects on the staining results. Primary submicroscopic silver precipitates are localized selectively in the osmiophilic parts of lysosomes and those degenerating presynaptic elements that are surrounded by glial processes. In degenerating axons, precipitates originating from mitochondria can usually be distinguished from terminal degeneration by their different size, shape, or characteristic arrangement. Nonspecific staining is restricted to glial fibrils, erythrocytes, and single cell nuclei. Dark field illumination can be applied routinely and television image analysis can be used for quantitative evaluation because of low background staining.","Stain technology","6162249",1980,"United States"
"Studies on plating efficiency and estimation of viability of suspensions of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast cells.","Mild sonication was used to obtain single cell suspensions of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. These cells were intact by microscopic criteria. Direct cell counts in a given inoculum and colony formation on various media were used to determine plating efficiency. Sonicated and nonsonicated cell suspensions were used to study plating efficiency and to estimated viability by means of vital dyes. Methylene blue Erythrosin B, and Janus green were unreliable when used with P. brasiliensis, but vital dyes were accurate when tested with Candida albicans. Acridine orange gave more meaningful results of viability. Estimates of viability, however, changed significantly as a result of relatively minor alterations in the composition of the suspending medium. In initial experiments, the plating efficiency of P. brasiliensis was dismally low. It descended abruptly with increasing dilution of inoculum. Efficiency was much improved if horse serum was added to brain heart infusion plates or if glucose glycine yeast extract (GGY) plates were incubated at room temperature and mycelial colonies were counted. With the technique we report, current plating efficiency of sonicated suspensions is of the order of 25%. Our results and procedures have an important bearing upon those studies concerned with in vitro killing of P. brasiliensis in suspensions or with isolating this fungus from clinical or environmental specimens.","Mycopathologia","6156415",1980,"Netherlands"
"Alteration of murine mammary tumor metastasis and growth by cytomegalovirus infection.","Host resistance to the development of metastatic lesions is complex and involves both lymphocyte and macrophage functions. Studies in both humans and animals have suggested that cytomegalovirus infection may alter these components of the defense mechanism of the host. In the present study, an experimental model was developed to determine whether cytomegalovirus infection would affect host resistance to the establishment of metastatic tumor nodules in the lungs of C3H mice after i.v. inoculation of a single-cell suspension of mammary tumor cells. The number of tumor nodules in the lungs, the lungs-heart/body weight ratio, and the mean day of death were determined in control animals inoculated i.v. with 10(6) mammary tumor cells and compared with groups of animals also receiving a sublethal i.p. inoculum of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (10(5) plaque-forming units) either 3 days before, on the day of, or 10 or 13 days after tumor cell inoculation. The results suggest a biphasic effect of virus infection on tumor development in the lung. A preexisting or concurrent MCMV infection suppressed tumor growth and prolonged life, while a MCMV infection later in tumorigenesis enhanced tumor growth and shortened survival. These data suggest that MCMV modulates host resistance to the development of metastatic tumor nodules and that this experimental model may be utilized to investigate further the relationship between virus-induced alterations of host defense mechanisms and tumor growth.","Cancer research","6258788",1980,"United States"

"Study of non-muscle cells of the adult mammalian heart: a fine structural analysis and distribution.","The characterization and distribution of non-muscle cells of the adult rat heart were carried out by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The non-muscle cells were examined during different phases of dissociation of the adult heart into single cell suspension. Non-muscle cells constituted approximately 65--70% of the ventricular cell suspension, while muscle cells constituted approximately 30--35%. Five types of non-muscle cells were observed: (1) endothelial cells, (2) fibroblasts, (3) pericytes, (4) smooth muscle cells, and (5) macrophages. The endothelial cells lining the internal wall of the ventricle possessed different surface morphology and shape than those lined with blood vessels. Fibroblasts were mostly scattered among the cardiac muscle cells and they contained highly developed rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum along with other structural features. Pericytes were characteristically observed on the periphery of the blood vessels and they showed structural similarities to the fibroblasts. Smooth muscle cells were relatively fewer than other non-muscle cells and generally served to line the wall of the medium calibre blood vessels of the heart. They were easily identified with their myofilaments. Although macrophages were observed in different regions of the heart, a small number of macrophage-like cells were strongly attached to the surfaces of the cardiac muscle cells. These cells were not released from the cardiac muscle cell surfaces even after prolonged treatment of proteolytic enzymes. Macrophages were mainly identified with their abundant filopodia, lysosomes and lysosomal degradation products. The functional implications of these non-muscle cells in relation to the heart was discussed.","Cytobios","7428441",1980,"England"
"T-tubules, couplings and myofibrillar arrangements in rat atrial myocardium.","Myocardial cells of rat atria have been studied using standard fixation and tannic acid mordanting. Cells were arranged in bundles or fascicles with little connective tissue. Fiber size varied, with complex cell junctions and in many fibers, particularly those of small diameter, no T-tubules or internal couplings were seen. Most cells, however, contained T-tubules, mainly coupled as triads at Z-lines but showing considerable variation in morphology. Direct continuity of T-tubules with the sarcolemma was demonstrated. Apparently unrelated to T-tubules and internal couplings, all cells showed the presence of peripheral couplings between sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma and, often, the subsarcolemmal element of reticulum was observed to pass internally in the sarcoplasm from a peripheral coupling. Also present were subsarcolemmal caveolae. The occasional presence within a single cell of myofibrils orientated in different planes was noted also. The findings are discussed in relation to the role of T-tubules and couplings in excitation-contraction.","Acta anatomica","7415803",1980,"Switzerland"
"Membrane properties of aggregate of collagenase-dissociated rat heart cells.","Aggregates of collagenase-dissociated neonatal rat heart cells have been tested for several membrane properties and shown to be comparable with cells from the intact heart. Action potentials, recorded from driven aggregates, are fully suppressed by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Under Mn2+, the plateau phase of the action potential disappears and no more mechanical activity can be detected. In aggregates, therefore, apparently both the fast sodium inward current and a slow inward current, which is at least partly carried by Ca2+ ions, contribute to the action potential. Pacemaker activity in spontaneously active aggregates is enhanced by adrenaline and slowed down by acetylcholine. Adrenaline also increases the plateau phase amplitude of the action potential and thereby the rate of repolarization. Acetylcholine shortens the action potential duration and increases the resting membrane potential. The electrical coupling between the cells in the aggregates is so tight that the aggregate seems to behave passively, like a single cell. It is concluded that aggregates of collagenase-dissociated neonatal rat heart cells may be used to study active electrical properties using the voltage clamp technique.","Advances in myocardiology","6248936",1980,"United States"
"Sarcomere length-resting tension relation in single frog atrial cardiac cells.","It generally has been thought that the relatively high resting tension characteristic of cardiac tissue resides in structures (collagen, elastin) external to the individual cardiac cells, but the evidence to support this conclusion has been indirect, since the resting tension of intact single cardiac cells has not been determined previously. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the resting tension (stress)-sarcomere length relationships of single intact frog atrial cells. For tension determinations, a single cell was attached between two poly-L-lysine coated glass beams; one beam served as a compliant calibrated cantilevered force beam, and length changes were imposed on the cell by movement of the other beam. Coventional bright-field light microscope techniques were used to view the cell, the sarcomere pattern within the cell, and the position of the force beam. The resting tension of the intact cell increased from a value of about 10 nN at a sarcomere length of 2.35 microns to a value of about 130 nN at a sarcomere length of 3.45 microns. Lagrangian and Eulerian resting stress-sarcomere length relationships were computed from the resting tension-sarcomere length relationships. The Lagrangian stress increased from a value of about 0.6 mN/mm2 at a sarcomere length of 2.35 microns to a value of about 7 mN/mm2 at a sarcomere length of 3.45 microns. These values of stress are about 8- to 30-fold less than those previously reported for intact frog atrial tissue and indicate that the resting tension of intact frog atrial preparations resides primarily in structures external to the individual cardiac cell.","Circulation research","476872",1979,"United States"
"Dissociation of adult mammalian heart into single cell suspension: an ultrastructural study.","Adult rat heart was dissociated into a single cell suspension by a perfusion technique which used 0.05% collagenase and 0.1% hyaluronidase in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRP). The non-muscle cells of the suspension were separated from the myocytes by centrifugation through 3% Ficoll solution in KRP with 0.01 mM Ca2+. An approximately 90% pure suspension of isolated single muscle cells was obtained with this method. The effects of the successive steps in the dissociation procedure on the ultrastructure of the heart were studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. After 30 minutes of enzyme digestion, dissociation of the inner endothelial lining of the ventricle into single cells or small groups of cells became apparent. In addition, the underlying cardiac skeleton began to disintegrate and linear arrays of cardiac muscle cells were observed. After 45 minutes of enzyme digestion the number of released single cells was higher because of the separation of intercalated discs. The majority of non-muscle cells were by now dissociated from the surfaces of muscle cells. Widening of the lateral intercellular spaces between the myocardial cells was associated with separation of desmosomes. In some regions of the heart, intact desmosomes, fasciae adherentes and gap junctions were observed even though lateral intercellular spaces had widened greatly. The majority of myocardial cells had become separated from one another after 60 minutes of enzyme digestion. Separation of gap junctional sites took place in two ways: (1) by 'unzipping' them through enzyme action; (2) by tearing them mechanically. Gap junction remnants were sometimes observed in a vesiculated state within the cell. The dissociation of the heart was ineffective when perfused with media containing 1.0 or 2 mM Ca2+. Alcian blue treatment after 60 minutes of enzyme digestion revealed that the basement membrane, and its accompanying collagen fibrils, was still present on the plasma membrane of dissociated single cells. The isolated myocardial cells retained their normal morphological characteristics. This study has enabled us to understand in detail how dismantlement of highly ordered adult cardiac tissue into a single cell suspension takes place. Cell suspensions of this type should be invaluable in the study of metabolic and synthetic activities in adult myocardial cells.","Journal of anatomy","120352",1979,"England"
"Correlation of function and morphology of neonatal rat and embryonic chick cultured cardiac and vascular muscle cells.","To develop morphological criteria which can be applied systematically for the identification of isolated cardiac and vascular muscle cells in mammalian and avian primary cultures, we have correlated structural and staining properties with excitability, contraction, and norepinephrine sensitivity of isolated muscle cells. The primary cultures of cardiac and vascular muscle contained muscle cells and nonmuscle cells. The muscle cells could be clearly identified by action potentials, contractility, and Masson's trichrome stain characteristics, similar to those of cells from intact source heart and blood vessels. Furthermore, the muscle cells were highly responsive to norepinephrine, showing unequivocal increases in contraction frequency. The sensitivity to norepinephrine was found to be very high (ED50 = 2.3 X 10(-9) M) Phase-contrast observation was sufficient to identify muscle cells only when those cells were contracting. There were no unequivocal morphological characteristics that distinguished between quiescent muscle cells and nonmuscle cells in the absence of histochemical staining. Ultrastructural examination by scanning electron microscopy failed to distinguish between muscle and nonmuscle cells. Histological staining was, therefore, the only reliable nonfunctional identification process that separated muscle cells from nonmuscle cells. Primary cultures, containing nonmuscle as well as muscle cells, are an important experimental preparation because the cellular heterogeneity probably minimizes muscle cell loss of function and phenotypic changes. The correlation we have established between cell staining and function will facilitate exploration of single cell properties, which together constitute hearts and blood vessels.","Circulation research","89916",1979,"United States"
"Platelet aggregation in rats in relation to hyperuricaemia induced by dietary single-cell protein and to protein deficiency.","A major limitation to single-cell protein (SCP) as a human food is its high nucleic acid content, the purine moiety of which is metabolised to uric acid. Rats given a Fusarium mould as a source of SCP in diets containing oxonate, a uricase inhibitor, showed elevated plasma and kidney uric acid concentrations after 21 d, which were related to the level of dietary mould. ADP-induced and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was greater in the hyperuricaemic rats than in controls and a progressive increase in aggregation with increasing levels of dietary mould was observed. Furthermore a time-lag, exceeding the life-span of rat platelets, was observed between the development of hyperuricaemia and the increase in aggregation. A similar time-lag was observed between the lowering of the hyperuricaemia and the reduction of platelet aggregation when oxonate was removed from the diet. If human platelets react to uric acid in the same manner as rat platelets this might explain the link that has been suggested between hyperuricaemia and ischaemic heart disease. In that event diets high in nucleic acids might be contra-indicated in people at risk from ischaemic heart disease. In rats given a low protein diet (50 g casein/kg) for 21 d ADP-induced and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and whole blood platelet count were reduced compared with control animals receiving 200 g casein/kg diet but not in rats given 90 or 130 g casein/kg diet. A study of the time course on this effect indicated that the reduction both in aggregation tendency and in whole blood platelet count occurred after 4 d of feeding the low protein diet. These values were further reduced with time.","Thrombosis and haemostasis","580986",1978,"Germany"
"A serological assay for the detection of cell surface receptors of nerve growth factor.","When single-cell suspensions prepared from embryonic day 8 (E8) chick sensory ganglia are incubated with nerve growth factor (NGF), anti-NGF antiserum, and complement, an NGF-dependent cytotoxic kill of 20 (+/- 3)% of the ganglia cells is observed. This percentage is increased by a factor of two when only the neuronal cells are tested. No kill is observed on the nonneuronal cell population representing 50% of the ganglia dissociate. When E8 sensory ganglia cells are cultured in the presence of NGF following cytotoxic kill, the large, phase-bright NGF-reponsive neurons are missing from the culture. These results indicate that the cells recognized in the cytotoxicity assay have to carry NGF-binding sites of type I, which is the one with the higher affinity of the two types of NGF-binding sites (I and II) present on sensory ganglia cells. This conclusion is further supported by the following data: a) half maximal cytotoxicity is reached already at a concentration of NGF which is below the KD of binding site I; b) a washing step which removes all NGF bound to type II receptors while leaving a high percentage of type I receptors occupied has no effect on the percentage of ganglia cells killed. Using the cytotoxicity assay the presence of high-affinity binding sites of type I can be demonstrated on sensory ganglia cells from E8 chick embryos but not from E4 embryos and not on liver and heart cells from E8 embryos. Further, type I receptor-bearing cells were detectable in the brain using this assay. At E8, NGF receptors could be detected on cells of the forebrain and the tectum but not on brain stem cells. Cytotoxic kill of forebrain cells was found to be especially high at E8 and E9, and decreased by E10.","Journal of supramolecular structure","219297",1978,"United States"

"Electromechanical properties of the single cell-layered heart of tunicate Boltenia ovifera (sea potato).","The tubular heart of the sea potato is composed of a single layer of myoepithelial cells interconnected near the extraluminal surface by specialized junctions. If these junctions are used as the border which separates the luminal from extraluminal membrane, the surface area ratio, luminal:extraluminal, is approximately 12:1. A single myofibril is located near the luminal surface in each cell. Current passed across the heart wall in the direction that depolarizes the luminal membrane and hyperpolarizes the extraluminal membrane immediately produces &quot;all-or-none&quot; action potentials and contractions. Current passed in the opposite direction fails to produce action potentials until after the break of the stimulus, suggesting anodal break excitation of the hyperpolarized luminal membrane. High potassium solutions depolarized the myoepithelium and produced contractions only when applied to the luminal surface of the heart. [Ca]0 increases and [Mg]0 decreases twitch tension only on the luminal surface of the heart. The transwall resistivity is low (50-100 omega/cm2) due to an extracellular shunt. Because of this shunt and the larger surface area of the luminal membrane, the extraluminal membrane is effectively clamped to the potential of the luminal membrane and is not capable of directly influencing excitation-contraction coupling. These findings suggest that only the luminal membrane of the sea potato myoepithelium is capable of generating an action potential and triggering contraction.","The Journal of general physiology","993769",1976,"United States"
"Chronic testing of a pacemaker that needs recharging only once every four years.","Since 1967, three series of rechargeable single-cell silver-mercuric oxide-zinc pacemakers have been implanted in dogs with complete heart block. The five nonhermetic units in series 1 failed after less than or equal to 18 months, primarily due to prototype cell deficiencies, although one cell functioned for eight years. The six units in series II contained improved cells, but failed due to gradual transepoxy fluid absorption after less than or equal to 31 months. All rechargeable cells were salvaged and dried, and, seven years after their manufacture, they continue to power pacing circuits. Series III now totals 20 doubly hermetically sealed units, tested for up to three years (total more than 300 months or 26 years), with no pacemaker failures. Accelerated tests indicate a minimum life of more than 50 years. A clinical trial is in progress.","Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)","985070",1976,"United States"
"Two to three years of failure-free testing of a rechargeable pacemaker in experimental complete heart block.","Six hermetically sealed single cell rechargeable mercury-zinc pacemakers (B.T.) that will run continuously for over 4 years between rechargings have paced dogs with complete heart block for from 2 to 3 years. To maintain full cell capacity (over 1,000 mA hours) requires recharging for from 2-3 min/day to 60 to 80 hr once every 4 years, with any variation between these extremes being acceptable. Six realtime bench tests continue after over 7 years and accelerated tests have simulated a minimum of 50 years continuous pacing. Battery voltage is assessed by direct telemetry, eliminating the risk of patient intrinsic rhythm-pacemaker competition which is present with all current indirect (stimulation rate change) battery assessment techniques. The B.T. is an excellent 4-5 year primary pacemaker, fully rechargeable after several 4 year periods of battery rundown. A clinical test series has been initiated.","Circulation","939023",1976,"United States"
"Pulseless idioventricular rhythm during CPR: an indication for massive intravenous bolus glucocorticoids.","Five consecutive patients were initially resuscitated successfully from pulseless idioventricular rhythm with the use of 100 mg of dexamethazone administered by intravenous push after all conventional modes of management had failed. In this small series, two of the five patients are long-term survivors and the deaths of the other three patients are attributable to advanced underlying pathology. The possible mechanisms of action of the glucocorticoids are not conclusively known.

These isolated cells have dimensions of about 5 mum in width and range in length from 300 mum to over 500 mum.

"Human ventricular refractoriness. Effects of cycle length, pacing site and atropine.","The effective refractory period of the right ventricle (ERP-V) was measured in 27 patients during atrial or ventricular pacing using the ventricular extra stimulus method. Pacing was conducted with impulses of 1.5-2 times diastolic threshold. The ERP-V was directly related to the basic cycle length (BCL) although the ERP-V was always greater for atrial pacing than for ventricular pacing at a given BCL. The ratio ERP-V/BCL was greater at shorter cycle lengths indicating that a larger fraction of the cycle was refractory at faster heart rates. The ratio ERP-V/QT interval did not change over a range of BCLs, but the ratio was larger for atrial pacing (.77 +/- .05 SD) than for ventricular pacing (.60 +/- .05). Atropine (1 mg i.v.) was given to six patients. The drug did not affect the ERP-V in six of eleven determinations, prolonged ERP-V twice and shortened it slightly three times. Measurements were reproducible over an hour but varied at a given BCL when measured on separate days. Asymptomatic repetitive beating occurred in seven of 27 patients when the premature stimulus was within 20 msec of the ERP-V. The effective refractory period of the right ventricle in man can be determined reproducibly and with safety. Changes induced by various perturbations parallel results from in vitro single cell and myocardial studies.","Circulation","1248076",1976,"United States"

"Isolation from the asian mouse Mus caroli of an endogenous type C virus related to infectious primate type C viruses.","Treatment of a cell line derived from the Asian feral mouse Mus caroli with 5-bromodeoxyuridine induces an infectious, xentropic type C virus. This virus shares strongly cross-reactive reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) and p30 antigens and crossinterferes with type C viruses isolated from a woolly monkey (SSAV) and gibbon apes (GALV). By similar criteria, the caroli virus is much less related to previously described type C viruses of the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. Induction of virus from 10 of 13 single cell clones indicates that the virus is endogenous in Mus caroli cells. Thre results suggest that infectious primate type C viruses arose by trans-species infection(s) of certain primates with endogenous type C viruses from MUs caroli or a closely related Mus species.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","49058",1975,"United States"
"Single cell layered heart: electromechanical properties of the heart of Boltenia ovifera.","The heart of Boltenia ovifera (the sea potato) is a tubular structure formed by a single layer of myocardial cells. Electron microscopic studies show that each cell contains a single myofibril located adjacent to the luminal surface of the cell. Electrical and mechanical measurement of a cannulated perfused heart demonstrate that only the luminal membrane is excitabble and elicits contraction on depolarization. Calcium and magnesium exert antagonistic effects on tension, and potassium depolarizes the myocardium and produces contractures when the luminal membrane is exposed to various concentrations of these ions. The extraluminl membrane does not respond electrically or mechanically to calcium magnesium or potassium, and its potential seems to be effectively &quot;clamped&quot; by the luminal membrane. Functionaly, therefore, this heart consists of a single active membrane with the adjacent contractile apparatus.","Science (New York, N.Y.)","4421742",1974,"United States"
"A quantitative assay for intercellular adhesion.","Intercellular adhesion is measured by a new method based on determination of the rates of attachment of single cells to confluent cell monolayers. The procedure is simple, rapid, and reproducible. Specific and nonspecific intercellular adhesions can be quantitated and distinguished from each other, and from the adhesion to glass (or plastic). The rate of adhesion of single cells to the monolayer is characteristic of more than 80% of the single-cell population. This method, therefore, provides a means for study of the molecular basis of intercellular adhesion.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","4351182",1973,"United States"

"Clonal growth in vitro of human cells with fibroblastic morphology; comparison of growth and genetic characteristics of single epithelioid and fibroblast-like cells from a variety of human organs.","A methodology has been described for reliable cultivation in vitro of dispersed fibroblastic cells obtained from normal human organs. The procedure has permitted establishment of stable cell lines from almost every sample taken, among which the following organs were represented: skin, spleen, amnion, lung, liver, bone marrow, brain, muscle, and heart. Equally good growth has been achieved with cells from embryonic or adult tissues. The methods previously developed whereby single cells plated in Petri dishes grow into isolated macroscopic colonies can successfully be applied to the plating of human fibroblastic stocks. Plating efficiencies in the neighborhood of 50 to 60 per cent are readily achieved with such strains. The resulting colonies can be picked and clonal stocks established. Fibroblastic morphology is maintained in the colonies arising from every single cell of such clonal stocks. All of the single cells from epithelioid clonal strains also maintain their integrity throughout repeated subculture. Since the difference between clonal stocks of these two types is always maintained whenever the respective single cells are plated in the same medium, regardless of the previous history of these stocks, it may be concluded that a true genetic difference exists in these cell lines. In addition to the morphological differences between epithelioid and fibroblastic cell strains, the latter have more demanding nutritional requirements for single cell growth. Thus, single cells of fibroblastic lines almost never produce colonies with high efficiency unless the growth medium which is sufficient for epithelioid cells is supplemented with embryo extract, or a cell feeder layer. Fibroblastic cells are also more resistant to tryptic digestion of the bond uniting the cells to glass surfaces. By use of differential media, growth of both fibroblastic and epithelioid cells, respectively, has been obtained, from dispersed single cells obtained by trypsinization of a specimen of human embryonic lung.","The Journal of experimental medicine","13439121",1957,"United States"
